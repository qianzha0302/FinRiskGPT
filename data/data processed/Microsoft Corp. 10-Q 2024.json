    "text": "NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting Principles \nOur unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the \nunaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary \nfor a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results \nfor a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the \nMicrosoft Corporation fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K and Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \non July 30, 2024 and December 3, 2024, respectively.\nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \ntransactions and balances have been eliminated. \nRecast of Certain Prior Period Information\nIn August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how \nwe currently manage our business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the \nProductivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating \ndecision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects \nthese segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage \nand monitor our business during fiscal year 2025. These changes impacted Note 8 – Goodwill, Note 12 – Unearned \nRevenue, and Note 17 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. \nThe recast of prior period information had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, \nor consolidated cash flows statements. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts \nof assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, \ndetermining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price \nof performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss \ncontingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our \nreporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the \nmarket value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is \nachieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated \nfinancial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results \nand outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to \nbe cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with \noriginal maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term \ninvestments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid \nnature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n8/83\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n9/83\nPART I\nItem 1"

    "text": "9\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive \nincome. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by \nmanagement. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market \nconditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine \ncredit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In \naddition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If \nwe have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, \nthen a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost \nbasis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future \nimpairments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a \nperiodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than \ncarrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the primary \nbeneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we have (1) the \npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to \nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We have \ndetermined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not \nconsolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have an investment in OpenAI \nGlobal, LLC (“OpenAI”) and have made total funding commitments of $13 billion. The investment is accounted for under \nthe equity method of accounting.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes \nin the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), \nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from \nthe assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other \ncomprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. \nGains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other \nincome (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily \nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the \nextent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value \nmeasurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement \nin its entirety. These levels are:\n•\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level \n1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 \nderivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n10/83\nPART I\nItem 1"

  {
    "id": "para_13",
    "text": "10\n•\nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the \nBlack-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by \nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models \nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable \ninputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for \ncurrencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, \nforeign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal \nsecurities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-\ncounter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n•\nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that \nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using \nmodel-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets \nand liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and \nintangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used \nin the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these \ninvestments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted \nmarket prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables \nAs of both December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, \nwas $4.9 billion and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server \ncomponents were $11.4 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated \nbalance sheets.\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and services \nofferings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, our \nfinancing receivables, net were $3.1 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing \nreceivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We \nrecord an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently \navailable evidence.\nRelated Party Transactions\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non-\nexclusive license to Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-founder of \nand serves on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed \nInterchange LLC (“Reprogrammed”) and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures (“Greylock”) each held less than a 10% \nequity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed and \nGreylock by virtue of his relationship with such entities.

The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim \nconsolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The \nstandard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, with \nearly adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.\nIncome Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure \nof disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate \nreconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our \nannual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard \non our income tax disclosures. \nIncome Statement – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new standard to expand disclosures about income statement expenses. The \nguidance requires disaggregation of certain costs and expenses included in each relevant expense caption on our \nconsolidated income statements in a separate note to the financial statements at each interim and annual reporting period, \nincluding amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The \nstandard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2028 and interim periods thereafter, with \nearly adoption permitted.

Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, \n2024 was primarily impacted by tax benefits from tax law changes in the prior fiscal year, including the delay of the \neffective date of final foreign tax credit regulations, and changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the \nU.S. and foreign countries. \nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and six months ended December 31, \n2024, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our \nproducts and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $25.8 billion \nand $24.9 billion, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017.

We assumed responsibility \nfor these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the \nNokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are \nstayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims \narising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency \nemission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either \noperated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also \nallege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on \nthe basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ \nmotion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of \nAppeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court \nfor further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were \nstricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted \ndefendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order \nexcluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to \nallow plaintiffs to appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the appeal \nwas argued in January of 2025. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, \nthe court entered summary judgment in nine of the stayed cases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by \nthe general causation outcome in the consolidated cases.\nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether \nLinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection \nRegulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In October 2024, the IDPC provided LinkedIn \nwith a final decision alleging GDPR violations and assessing a fine. In November 2024, LinkedIn appealed the final \ndecision to the Irish courts.\nOther Contingencies\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. \nAlthough management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a \nmaterial adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and \nmanagement’s view of these matters may change in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $510 million. While we intend to defend these matters \nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $800 million in aggregate beyond recorded \namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material \nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n30/83\nPART I\nItem 1"

Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; \nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, \nmarketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared with the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 included:\n•\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 21% to $40.9 billion.\n•\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 15% driven by Microsoft 365 \nCommercial cloud revenue growth of 16%.\n•\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 8% driven by Microsoft 365 Consumer \ncloud revenue growth of 8%. \n•\nLinkedIn revenue increased 9%.\n•\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 15% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of \n19%.\n•\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 21% driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue \ngrowth of 31%.\n•\nWindows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4%.\n•\nXbox content and services revenue increased 2%.\n•\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 21%.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n37/83\n32\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n38/83\nPART I\nItem 2"

    "text": "Industry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each \nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \nindustry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and \ndevelopment activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, \nand competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and \nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the \ncloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our \nsoftware, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. \nWe must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and \nmay decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter \nlocations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing \ndemand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, \nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are \nprimarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use \nother manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our \nproducts contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these \nsuppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \nbroad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, \nand competitive compensation and benefits.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and \nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may \nsignificantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have \na material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and six months ended \nDecember 31, 2024.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is \ndriven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\nReportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent \nCloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with \nour internal management reporting.\nIn August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how \nwe currently manage our business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the \nProductivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating \ndecision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects \nthese segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage \nand monitor our business during fiscal year 2025.\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 17 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of \nthe Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n39/83\n33\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n40/83\nPART I\nItem 2"

Many countries have implemented or are in \nthe process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which applies to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we \ndo not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as \ncountries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on \nSeptember 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the \nNOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion \nplus penalties and interest. As of December 31, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are \nadequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s \nadministrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in \nthe next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to \nour income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to \nexamination for tax years 1996 to 2024, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of \neach of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital \nmarkets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing \nactivities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax \nrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $71.6 billion and $75.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and \nJune 30, 2024, respectively. Equity and other investments were $15.6 billion and $14.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 \nand June 30, 2024, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital \npreservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among \nindustries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include \nforeign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk \nand credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns \nthat correlate to certain fixed-income indices.

This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. \ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical \nassets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or \ninputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our \nLevel 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, \nmortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are \nvalued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a \nrecurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these \nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying \nsignificant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by \nour pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. \nOur broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these \ninvestments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments \nhave a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our \nfair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls \ninclude model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent \nrecalculation of prices where appropriate.\nCash Flows\nCash from operations increased $7.0 billion to $56.5 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to \nan increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and \ncash used to pay income taxes. Cash used in financing increased $32.4 billion to $27.8 billion for the six months ended \nDecember 31, 2024, primarily due to $6.7 billion in cash used for repayments of debt, net of proceeds in the current period \ncompared to $23.6 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments in the prior period. Cash used in \ninvesting decreased $42.1 billion to $29.3 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a $63.0 \nbillion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other \nassets, offset in part by an $11.1 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and an $8.5 billion decrease in \ncash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.\nDebt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The \nproceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, \nfunding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. \nRefer to Note 10 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software \nAssurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract \nperiod for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes \npayments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the \nproduct or service.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n54/83\nPART I\nItem 2"

Preparing \nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of \noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, \ngoodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and business combinations – \nvaluation of intangible assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining \nwhether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \nversus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software \nlicenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and \naccounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. \nCertain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation \nbetween the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. \nRevenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a \nsingle amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or \nsoftware updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the \nproducts and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative \nSSP of the various products and services.\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \ngeographic region in determining the SSP.\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.\nImpairment of Investment Securities\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, \nwe evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to \nwhich the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ \na systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment \nof our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business \noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the \nsecurity before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income \n(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions \ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n57/83\nPART I\nItem 2"

We perform a \nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the \namount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in \nother income (expense), net.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \napproach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would \nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could \ninclude a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or \ndisposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of \nassets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each \nreporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow \nmethodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on \ninternal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash \nflows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the \ndetermination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until \ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs \nare capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when \ntechnological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software \nproducts is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of \nrevenue over the estimated life of the products.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss \nfrom a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset \nhas been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining \nwhether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome \nand the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n58/83\nPART I\nItem 2"

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more \nlikely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits \nof the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the \nlargest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also \nprovides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and \nliabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is \nrequired in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial \nstatements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations – Valuation of Intangible Assets\nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the estimated \nfair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value involves estimates \nand assumptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRefer to Note 14 – Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information \nregarding legal proceedings in which we are involved.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that \ncould adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading price of \nour common stock.\nSTRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may adversely affect our \nresults of operations.\nCompetition in the technology sector\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to \nsmall, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, \nand financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete \nevolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products \nand services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and \nconsumers, we may not remain competitive, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations.\nCompetition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants \ncan build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application \ndevelopers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is \nnecessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing \nplatforms.\n•\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the hardware and software elements of a \nproduct and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, \ngaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue \nfrom services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold \nthrough their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from \ntheir vertically-integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and \nservices. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically-integrated model may increase our cost of revenue \nand reduce our operating margins.\n•\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant \ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and \ntablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its \nplatform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by PCs. \nEven if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices may make it \nmore difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating \nsystems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or \nservices offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our \ndevices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n61/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

The \nvariety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing \ndecisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. \nTo compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these \napplications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ \ncontent and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. \nCompetitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute \nproducts and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which \nmay adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBusiness model competition\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n•\nA material part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing \ndevices. Our competitors continue to develop and deploy cloud-based services for consumers and business \ncustomers, and pricing and delivery models are evolving. We and our competitors are devoting significant \nresources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.\n•\nWe are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities \ninto our consumer and commercial offerings. AI technology and services are a highly competitive and rapidly \nevolving market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant development and \noperational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms, and infrastructure necessary to meet \nthe needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, new \nand potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.\n•\nEven as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business \nmodels, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. \nWe bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and \ndevelopment, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our \ncompetitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n•\nOther competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling \nthird-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors \nprovide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n•\nSome companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to \nend users, developing, making available, or using AI models that are open, and earning revenue on advertising \nor integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the \nopen source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased \noperating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which may adversely affect our \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant costs to \nbuild and maintain infrastructure to support cloud-based and AI services. These costs will reduce the operating margins. \nWhether we succeed in cloud-based and AI services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n•\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI services and products that generate increasing \ntraffic and market share.\n•\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI services on the growing array \nof computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n62/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

If we are \nnot effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail \nto generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and \ndevelopment investments described above. This may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of \noperations.\nOur AI systems offer users powerful tools and capabilities. However, there may be instances where these systems are \nused in ways that are unintended or inappropriate. In addition, some users may also engage in fraudulent or abusive \nactivities through our cloud-based and AI services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or terms of \nservice violations including cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. While we are committed to detecting and \ncontrolling such misuse of our cloud-based and AI services, our efforts may not be effective, and we may incur reputational \ndamage or experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue \nto make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies. \nIn addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and \nservices. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and \nentertainment, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial \nsuccess depends on many factors, including innovation, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If \ncustomers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce \ntheir purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve \nsignificant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New \nproducts and services may not be profitable or may not achieve operating margins as high as we have experienced \nhistorically. We may not get engagement in certain features that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data-\nhandling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, \ndriven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact \nproduct and feature adoption. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing \nperiods. We could experience significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or \nservices. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n63/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

We expect to \ncontinue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business \nstrategy. For example, in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and in October 2023 \nwe completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”). In January 2023 we announced the third \nphase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant \nchallenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our \ninvestment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and \nretaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or \nthat announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing \ncircumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. We also have \nlimited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which may impact our ability to realize \nthe anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend in part on our ability to leverage \nthem to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as the acquired companies’ \nability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer \nthan expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue or \nenhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. In addition, an acquisition may be \nsubject to challenge even after it has been completed. For example, the Federal Trade Commission continues to challenge \nour Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or unwind the transaction. These events could adversely \naffect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant \ncharge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from \nthose acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible \nassets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We \ntest goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying \nvalue of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and \nmarket capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we \nparticipate. We have recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated \nfinancial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is \ndetermined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n64/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

Threat actors, including individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated \norganizations, including nation-states or state-sponsored organizations, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to \nour customers and our internal infrastructure, and we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have \ngained unauthorized access to our systems and data, including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide \nvariety of methods, which include developing and deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential \nvulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and \nservices or gain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, \nusers, partners, or customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to \nour data or our users’ or customers’ data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For \nexample, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2024 \nand amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a password \nspray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The threat actor \nused information it obtained to gain unauthorized access to some of our source code repositories and internal systems, \nand the threat actor may continue to utilize this and other information to attempt to gain access to our systems or otherwise \nadversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm to our \nreputation and customer relationships. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activities for \nextended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our \ncustomers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify due to our transparency to our customers, other \nstakeholders, and the public about cyberattacks, and during elections or periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict. \nChallenges or failures in applying security patches to all hardware and devices connected to our systems, including end-of-\nlife and end-of-support equipment, have and may continue to result in unauthorized access to our systems and data in the \nfuture. Cyber incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of \noperations, competitive position, and reputation, or expose us to legal or regulatory risk.\nInadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or those \nof the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our systems and data, including \ncustomer systems and data, in the future. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account \naccess when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or \nsystems or reveal confidential information, and laws in foreign jurisdictions may compel actions by such parties against our \ninterests and could limit our recourse. Malicious actors may employ the supply chain to introduce malware through \nsoftware updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n65/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI and \nmachine learning. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may \nallow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine the best way to \ninvestigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful, and \nwe may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access to other \nnetworks and systems after establishing a foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can have cascading \nimpacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, as well as those of our partners and \ncustomers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, \nparticularly for sophisticated attacks. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to provide prompt, full, and \nreliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our facilities, \nnetwork, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide \nservices to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise \nconfidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject \nus to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of \nattacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident could result in \noutages, data losses, and disruptions of our services.\nOur internal environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace \nnew ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social \nnetworking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may \ncreate new attack surfaces or methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep \npace with these changes as new threats emerge or the emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.\nSecurity of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or \nservices across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us, \nwhose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to or attacks on our own infrastructure, \nsuch as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our customers and may do so in the \nfuture. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other \nelements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend \nto focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we \nexpect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes \nexploiting previously unknown (“zero-day”) vulnerabilities, such as the attack in early calendar year 2021 with several of \nour Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued \nsecurity patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities \nbefore patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack \ncustomers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account \ninformation can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same \nattributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user \nactivity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. \nThere may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we \nincreasingly incorporate open source software into our products. Additionally, features that rely on generative AI may be \nsusceptible to unanticipated security threats from adversaries as we add new generative AI features to our services while \ncontinuously developing our understanding of security risks and protection methods in the new field of generative AI.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n66/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

As a result, we may not be \nable to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure \nalternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ \nvulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our technology, and \nconsequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-of-the-art \ncybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication \nwhen defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit \nor otherwise impact other aspects of operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these \ndefaults.\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are \ncommitted to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable \ninformation for customers to help protect themselves.

As we continue to grow the \nnumber, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal \ndata of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external \nenvironment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our \nbusiness groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and \nthird parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer \nor user data we or our vendors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to continuously improve security controls, \nit is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that could lead to the misuse of our systems or \ncustomer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data \nin unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or \nusers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our \nsoftware products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or in \na cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data \nin response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and \nappropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user \ndata, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit \nsales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and \ngovernment entities.

    "text": "Our products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services interact \nwith them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks. Our products and services may contain defects in \ndesign, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. For example, an \nInternet of Things solution may have multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of \nwhich we may not develop or control, and may have limited ability to be updated or patched. Further, customers control our \nproducts and services, including our AI products, within their environments, and may deploy them in high-risk scenarios or \nutilize them inappropriately. As a result, our products and services may increasingly affect personal health and safety. Our \nproducts may also collect large amounts of data in manners which may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. \nOur customers also operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors whose \nproducts or personnel may take or fail to take actions which impact the reliability or security of our products and services. If \nour products and services do not work as intended, are utilized in methods not intended, violate the law, or harm \nindividuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase \nour costs, damage our reputation, or adversely affect our results of operations.\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building \nAI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to \nuse in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. \nWe expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in devices, applications, and \nthe cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents \nrisks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may \nbe flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may \nbe offensive, illegal, inaccurate, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by \nMicrosoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, \ncustomers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain inputs and \noutputs may be required. Our implementation of AI systems could result in legal liability, regulatory action, brand, \nreputational, or competitive harm, or other adverse impacts. These risks may arise from current copyright infringement and \nother claims related to AI training and output, new and proposed legislation and regulations, such as the European Union’s \n(“EU”) AI Act and the U.S.’s AI Executive Order, and new applications of data protection, privacy, consumer protection, \nintellectual property, and other laws. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we \nenable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and \npartners, are contrary to our responsible AI policies and practices, or are otherwise controversial because of their impact \non human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, our reputation, competitive position, \nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an \nadequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products \nand services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and \nequipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our \ndatacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking \nsupplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. The cost or availability of these \ndependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local \nand regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce \nnew products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services, including through the \nincorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end \nhosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is \nexpensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and \nreliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is \nrobust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational \nfailures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, outages, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or \nunavailable power or water supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products, \nservices, and user experience, resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory \nactions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may \nadversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n69/83\n56\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n70/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our \nserver capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. \nCapacity available to us may be affected as competitors use some of the same suppliers and materials for hardware \ncomponents. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry \nshortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement \nsupplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development \nof our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory \nadjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Datacenter servers, Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other hardware \nare assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages \nwhich may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. \nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software \nwe develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly \nrely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent on \none another. Our products and services may be impacted by interaction with third-party products and services. Our \ncustomers may also utilize their own or third-party products and services whose reliability is dependent on interaction with \nour products and services. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any \ndefects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales, damage to our reputation, repair or \nremediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability, which could adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that \neliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\nOur hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly \ncomplex. Failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in \nrecalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\nGovernment enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how we design and market \nour products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are \nactively enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to intervene in digital markets, and this \nincludes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or \nconsumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities have previously brought \nenforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\nFor example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) has designated Windows and LinkedIn as core platform \nservices subject to obligations under the EU Digital Markets Act, which prohibits certain self-preferencing behaviors and \nplaces limitations on certain data use among other obligations. The Commission also continues to closely scrutinize the \ndesign of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, \nsuch as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such \nas Microsoft 365 and Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws. \nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time, our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for \nour platforms. As a result, we increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail \nto do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, \nparticularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert \ndownward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n71/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

New competition law actions or obligations under market regulation schemes could \nbe initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, \ncould adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain \nmarkets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability \nto consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value, which may adversely affect \nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal \npenalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and \nregulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting \nprovisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to \ntime, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and \nothers about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we \nreceive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law \nenforcement authorities. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from \ncolluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our \nU.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to \nreduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may violate our \npolicies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, \ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to \nour reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the \nU.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business \nwith restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, \nor making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain \ninformation and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions \ninvolving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain \nregulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or \narmed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade \nrestrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade \necosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem \ndisruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenue, increased costs, loss of \nexport privileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result \nin increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-\nbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements \nrelating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-\nU.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data \nfrom the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal \nrequirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the \nuse of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new \nrules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products \nand services. \n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n72/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

    "text": "In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an \nestablishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations \nregarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use \nof data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and \nrestriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate \ncompliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. \nWe might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or \nhelp our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply \nmakes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators \ninterpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to \ncomplaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary \npenalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of \ncustomers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology \ncompanies, and European data protection authorities have taken action to block or remove services from their markets. \nJurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or \nexpanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\nOur investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, \nincluding AI services, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of \nquality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the \nexpected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, \nor relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data \nsovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and \ninternal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding \npersonal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower \nrevenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations \nmight limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure \nto comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, \nnegative publicity, and diversion of management time and effort.\nExisting and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are \nsubject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply \nto our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, \ntelecommunications, data storage and protection, digital accessibility, advertising, and online content. Laws in several \njurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code and the Digital \nServices Act, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated services. This trend may continue and will result in \nthese offerings being subject to additional data protection, security, digital safety, law enforcement surveillance, and other \nobligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and \nother information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via \ntechnology such as cookies. In addition, laws requiring us to retrieve and produce customer data in response to \ncompulsory legal demands from law enforcement and governmental authorities are expanding and the requests we are \nexperiencing are increasing in volume and complexity. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations \nare expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to \ncybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative \nand regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict \nopportunity. For example, the EU’s AI Act may increase costs or impact the provision or operation of our AI models and \nservices in the European market. \nHow these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may \nbe inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and \nservices, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve \nsignificant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. \nNoncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties, criminal sanctions, or orders to cease the alleged noncompliant \nactivity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other \nstakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we \ncould face regulatory or legal actions, and our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations could be \nadversely affected.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n73/83\n59\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n74/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product \nreleases, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. \nAs we continue to expand our business and offerings, we may experience new and novel legal claims. Adverse outcomes \nin some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our \nability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of \nthese matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations could \noccur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from \ngovernment contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial \nagreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could \nbe suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under \ncertain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause \nand provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, \nreductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. \nThese events could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. \nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, \nthere are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize \nadditional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and administrative \npractices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions. In recent years, multiple \ndomestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large multinational enterprises. \nFor example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals or guidance \nin international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income \ntaxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, \neconomic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably \nmore difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for prior tax years and have received Notices \nof Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to \nintercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties \nand interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts \nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our results of operations in the period or periods in \nwhich that determination is made.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in \ncountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about \ncertain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes \nin U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other global fundamental law \nchanges currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ \nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely affect our financial condition and \nresults of operations.\nWe are subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations, which exposes us to \nincreased costs and legal and reputational risks. Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental, social, and \ngovernance matters are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may include specific, \ntarget-driven frameworks and disclosure requirements. In addition, we have established and publicly announced goals and \ncommitments to become carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and protect more land than we use. Any failure or \nperceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and commitments or to satisfy various sustainability reporting \nstandards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce, or at all, could result in claims and lawsuits, \nregulatory actions, or damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely affect our business, operations, financial \ncondition, and results of operations.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n75/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and \nuse of our software, source code, and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of \nharmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. \nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Our increasing \nengagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain \nsituations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSource code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our \nbusiness. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier \nfor third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our results of \noperations. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also could increase the \nsecurity risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their \nintellectual property rights, including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output. To \nresolve these claims, we may enter into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on terms that are less \nfavorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy \nindemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive \nrelief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. \nWe have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to \nprocure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so, which could \nadversely affect our results of operations.\nGENERAL RISKS\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and results of operations may be harmed. Our reputation \nand brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract \nand retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be \ndamaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain \npractices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, \nemployees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions, public policy positions, or corporate \nphilanthropic initiatives. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n•\nThe introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do \nnot like.\n•\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and deployment \nof AI.\n•\nData security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible AI failures, compliance failures, or actions of \npartners or individual employees.\nSocial media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are \ndamaged, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified \nemployees.\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, \nrecession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our \nresults of operations. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business \nspending for those products declines, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n76/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as \nthe bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have \npurchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general \ncredit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global \nfinancial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial \nmarkets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or \nthreatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that \nmore of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect \nour financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems, \noperations, or supply chain because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other \ncatastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our \ncorporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential \nbusiness operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area \nof California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption \nof any of our critical business or systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm \nour ability to conduct normal business operations or adversely affect our results of operations. Providing our customers \nwith more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business \ncontinuity management plans and magnifies the potential negative consequences of prolonged service outages.\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose economic and \nother risks, which may negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers, increase our operating costs, or \notherwise disrupt our operations in markets both directly and indirectly impacted by such events. These conditions also \nmay add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply \nchain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and \nrequirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global \nmarkets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some \nmarkets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our business, \noperations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going \nforward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' \nactions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial \nmarket instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental \nregulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability \nor cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we \noperate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide \ncloud-based services.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n77/83\nPART II\nItem 1A"

    "text": "63\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers, employees, and infrastructure are \nlocated throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our \nbusiness creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Global, regional, and local economic developments, \nmonetary policy, restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, inflation, and \nrecession, as well as political and military disputes, may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our \ninternational growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including \ndeterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and \nmanaging foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the \nenvironment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. \nChanges to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher \ntariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other \ndevelopments that make it more difficult to operate and sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in \ndeveloped or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate \nin certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, \nsignificant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our \nresults of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully \nattracting, training, and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The \nmarket for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, \nas well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to \nrecruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration \nlaws. Restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent, including as a result of changes to U.S. immigration \npolicies or laws, may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful \nin our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver \nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-\nterm success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could \nhinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce \npractices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global \nworkforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are \nrepresented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to \nform or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational \nchanges necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\n2025/4/14 21:07\n10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017025010491/msft-20241231.htm\n78/83\nPART II\nItem 2"
