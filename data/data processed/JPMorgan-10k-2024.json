Business.\nOverview\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the \n“Firm”, NYSE: JPM), a financial holding company \nincorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading \nfinancial services firm based in the United States of \nAmerica (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. \nJPMorganChase had $4.0 trillion in assets and $344.8 \nbillion in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2024. \nThe Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial \nservices for consumers and small businesses, \ncommercial banking, financial transaction processing \nand asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and \nChase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers, \npredominantly in the U.S., and many of the world’s \nmost prominent corporate, institutional and \ngovernment clients globally.\nJPMorganChase’s principal bank subsidiary is \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association \n(“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national banking \nassociation with U.S. branches in 48 states and \nWashington, D.C. JPMorganChase’s principal non-\nbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. \nMorgan Securities”), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank \nand non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorganChase operate \nnationally as well as through overseas branches and \nsubsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary \nforeign banks. The Firm’s principal operating \nsubsidiaries outside the U.S. are J.P. Morgan Securities \nplc and J.P. Morgan SE (“JPMSE”), which are \nsubsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and are \nbased in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Germany, \nrespectively.\nThe Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com. \nJPMorganChase makes available on its website, free of \ncharge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports \non Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K \npursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as \nreasonably practicable after it electronically files or \nfurnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov. \nJPMorganChase makes new and important \ninformation about the Firm available on its website at \nhttps://www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the \nInvestor Relations section of its website at https://\nwww.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on the Firm's \nwebsite, including documents on the website that are \nreferenced in this Form 10-K, is not incorporated by \nreference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K” or \n“Form 10-K”) or the Firm’s other filings with the SEC. \nBusiness segments & Corporate\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, \nJPMorganChase reorganized its reportable business \nsegments by combining the former Corporate & \nInvestment Bank and Commercial Banking business \nsegments to form one reportable segment, the \nCommercial & Investment Bank. As a result of the \nreorganization, the Firm has three reportable business \nsegments – Consumer & Community Banking (“CCB”), \nCommercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”) and Asset & \nWealth Management (“AWM”) – with the remaining \nactivities in Corporate. The Firm’s consumer business \nsegment is CCB, and the Firm’s wholesale business \nsegments are CIB and AWM.\nA description of the Firm’s reportable business \nsegments and the products and services that they \nprovide to their respective client bases, as well as a \ndescription of Corporate activities, is provided in the \nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial \ncondition and results of operations section of this \nForm 10-K (“Management’s discussion and analysis” or \n“MD&A”) under the heading “Business Segment & \nCorporate Results,” which begins on page 52, and in \nNote 32. \nCompetition\nJPMorganChase and its subsidiaries and affiliates \noperate in highly competitive environments. \nCompetitors include other banks, brokerage firms, \ninvestment banking companies, merchant banks, \nhedge funds, commodity trading companies, private \nequity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund \ncompanies, investment managers, credit card \ncompanies, mortgage banking companies, trust \ncompanies, securities processing companies, \nautomobile financing companies, leasing companies, \ne-commerce and other internet-based companies, \nfinancial technology companies, and other companies \nengaged in providing similar and new products and \nservices. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on \nthe basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s \nproducts and services, transaction execution, \ninnovation, reputation and price. Competition also \nvaries based on the types of clients, customers, \nindustries and geographies served. With respect to \nsome of its geographies and products, \nJPMorganChase competes globally; with respect to \nothers, the Firm competes on a national or regional \nbasis. New competitors in the financial services \nindustry continue to emerge, including firms that offer \nproducts and services solely through the internet and \nnon-financial companies that offer products and \nservices that disintermediate traditional banking \nproducts and services offered by financial services \nfirms such as JPMorganChase.\nPart I\n1\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive \nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as \nthe applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. \nin which the Firm does business.  \nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a \nbank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding \ncompany (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject \nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, \nregulation and examination by the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). \nThe Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the \nconsolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of \nJPMorganChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated \ndirectly by additional authorities based on the \nactivities or licenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorganChase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, \nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nJPMorganChase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised \nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the \nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and regulated by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). \nJ.P. Morgan Securities plc holds a banking license in \nthe U.K. and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential \nRegulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial \nConduct Authority (“FCA”). \nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution jointly \nregulated by the European Central Bank (“ECB”), the \nGerman Financial Supervisory Authority and the \nGerman Central Bank, as well as the local regulators in \neach of the countries in which it operates. The Firm’s \nother non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the \nbanking, securities, prudential, payments and conduct \nregulatory authorities, as applicable, in the countries in \nwhich they operate. \nPermissible business activities. The Bank Holding \nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in \nbusiness activities other than the business of banking \nand certain closely-related activities. FHCs are \npermitted to engage in a broader range of financial \nactivities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to \nlimit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible \nactivities if the FHC or any of its depository institution \nsubsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility \nrequirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose \ncorrective capital and/or managerial requirements on \nthe FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require \ndivestiture of the FHC’s depository institutions. If any \ndepository institution controlled by an FHC fails to \nmaintain a satisfactory rating under the Community \nReinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit \nthe FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new \nactivities other than those permissible for BHCs, or \nacquiring a company engaged in such activities. \nCapital and liquidity requirements. The Federal \nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage \nrequirements for JPMorganChase that are generally \nconsistent with the international Basel III capital and \nliquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s \ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC \nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries \nand branches are also subject to local capital and \nliquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and \nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial \ninstitutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators \nreleased a proposal to amend the U.S. risk-based \ncapital framework to incorporate certain elements of \nthe revised international Basel III capital framework. \nThe proposal would significantly revise risk-based \ncapital requirements for banks with assets of $100 \nbillion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global \nsystemically important banks (\"GSIBs\"). Finalization of \nthe proposal, including the required implementation \ndate, is uncertain. The Firm continues to monitor \ndevelopments and potential impacts.\nIn the EU and U.K., regulators have finalized the rules \nimplementing their Basel III frameworks. The new rules \nbecame effective in the EU beginning January 1, 2025, \nwith market risk aspects delayed until January 1, 2026. \nIn January 2025, the PRA announced that it intends to \ndelay the implementation of the new rules in the U.K. to \nJanuary 1, 2027. There are certain transitional \narrangements applicable in both the EU and U.K. until \n2032 and 2030, respectively.\nStress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorganChase is \nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by \nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s \nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review \n(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual \ncompany-run stress tests and must also submit an \nannual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into \naccount the results of separate stress tests designed \nby each of the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The \nFederal Reserve uses the results under the severely \nadverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to \ndetermine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) \nrequirement for the coming year, which forms part of \nthe Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is \nrequired to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5, \n2025. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its \nindicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2025 and final \nSCB requirement by August 31, 2025. The Firm’s final \nPart I\n2\nSCB requirement will become effective on October 1, \n2025. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to \nperform separate, similar stress tests annually. The \nFirm publishes each year the results of the annual \nstress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, \nN.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse” \nscenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the \nOCC. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve \nindicated in a press release that it intends to seek \npublic comment on changes to its stress testing \nframework. Additionally, there is a pending legal \nchallenge to the manner in which stress testing is \nadministered. Refer to Litigation and regulatory \nchallenges on pages 6-7 for further information.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 \nand Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for \nmore information.\nEnhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate \nto identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of \nthe U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) \nrecommends prudential standards and reporting \nrequirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically \nimportant financial institutions (“SIFIs”), such as \nJPMorganChase. The Federal Reserve has adopted \nseveral rules to implement those heightened \nprudential standards, including rules relating to risk \nmanagement and corporate governance of subject \nBHCs. JPMorganChase is required under these rules to \ncomply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk \nmanagement standards, including oversight by the \nboard of directors of risk management activities.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan \nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of \nfinancial strength for its depository institution \nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those \nsubsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the \nFederal Reserve. \nRegulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and \ntheir banks are subject to requirements, limitations \nand prohibitions established by law and by the Federal \nReserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs \nare required to obtain the approval of the Federal \nReserve before they acquire more than 5% of the \nvoting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, \nacquisitions by financial companies are generally \nprohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total \nliabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% \nof the total liabilities of all financial companies, as \ndetermined under Federal Reserve regulations. \nFurthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must \nprovide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to \nacquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any \nvoting shares of any company with over $10 billion in \nassets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in \nnature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a \nbroader range of activities (including acquisitions) \nthan BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to \nlimit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible \nacquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository \ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable \neligibility requirements.\nOngoing obligations. The Firm is subject to a five-year \ncooperation obligation under an order issued by the \nCFTC on September 29, 2020, relating to precious \nmetals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations. The \nFirm also remains subject to consent orders entered \ninto in March 2024 with the OCC and the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, and a \nresolution entered into in May 2024 with the CFTC, \nwhich relate to the Firm’s processes to inventory \ntrading venues and confirm the completeness of \ncertain data fed to trade surveillance platforms.\nSubsidiary banks: \nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s \nprincipal subsidiary bank, are limited to those \nspecifically authorized under the National Bank Act \nand related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has \nauthority to bring an enforcement action against \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound \nbanking practices, which could include limiting \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct \notherwise permissible activities, or imposing \ncorrective capital or managerial requirements on the \nbank.\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance \nfund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits \nand is funded through assessments on banks, \nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The FDIC is \nrequired to maintain a minimum reserve ratio, which \nmeasures the balance of reserves in the deposit \ninsurance fund against an estimate of FDIC-insured \ndeposits, of 1.35%. The reserve ratio is currently below \nthe statutory minimum and, in October 2022, the FDIC \nadopted a final rule to raise bank assessments and \naccelerate the time by which the reserve ratio would \nmeet the statutory minimum. As a result, the FDIC has \nadopted a restoration plan to bring the reserve ratio up \nto the required 1.35% by September 30, 2028, with a \nlonger-term target of maintaining a reserve ratio of 2%.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any \ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC \ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad \npowers to transfer assets and liabilities without the \napproval of the institution’s creditors.  \nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 \nrequires the relevant federal banking regulator to take \n“prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository \ninstitution if that institution does not meet certain \n3\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is \nalso authorized to take appropriate action against the \nparent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on \nthe undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In \ncertain instances, the BHC would be required to \nguarantee the performance of the capital restoration \nplan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. \nHeightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S., the \nOCC has established guidelines setting forth \nheightened standards for large banks, including \nminimum standards for the design and \nimplementation of a risk governance framework for \nbanks. Under these standards, a bank’s risk \ngovernance framework must ensure that the bank’s \nrisk profile is easily distinguished and separate from \nthat of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. \nThe bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for \napproving the bank’s risk governance framework, \nproviding active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking \nactivities, and holding management accountable for \nadhering to the risk governance framework.\nThe Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. are \nsubject to supervisory expectations published by the \nECB and the PRA, respectively, addressing bank \nstrategy, governance and risk management in the \nareas of climate change, operational resilience, \nreliance on IT systems and third-party services, and \nresilience from macro-financial and geopolitical \nshocks. \nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to \nrestrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of \ncredit to, investments in stock or securities of, and \nderivatives, securities lending and certain other \ntransactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain \nother affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan \nChase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries unless \nthe loans are secured in specified amounts and \ncomply with certain other requirements. \nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations \non the payment of dividends by national banks, such \nas JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the \namount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \ncould pay, at January 1, 2025, to JPMorganChase \nwithout the approval of the banking regulators. The \nOCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to \nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank \nsubsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking \nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would \nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the \nfinancial condition of the bank. \nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of \na receiver of an insured depositary institution (“IDI”) for \nadministrative expense and the claims of holders of \nU.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits \nin non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. \nand in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims \nof other unsecured creditors of the institution, \nincluding depositors in non-U.S. branches and public \nnoteholders. \nConsumer supervision and regulation. \nJPMorganChase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are \nsubject to supervision and regulation in the U.S. by the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with \nrespect to federal consumer protection laws, including \nlaws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of \nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in \nconnection with the offer, sale or provision of \nconsumer financial products and services. The CFPB \nalso has jurisdiction over small business lending \nactivities with respect to fair lending and the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory \noversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement \nactions against firms that offer certain products and \nservices to consumers using practices that are \ndeemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In March \n2024, the CFPB released a final rule which significantly \nreduces the late payment fees that large credit card \nissuers, including the Firm, are permitted to charge to \ncustomers (the “CFPB Late Fee Rule”). The final rule is \ncurrently stayed pending resolution of an industry-led \nchallenge in federal court. Refer to Litigation and \nregulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for further \ninformation.\nIn addition, in October 2024, the CFPB issued a final \nrule that requires data providers, including banks, to \nmake certain consumer data available to consumers \nand authorized third parties in electronic form \nbeginning in April 2026 (the “CFPB Data Sharing \nRule”). Refer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on \npages 6-7 for further information.\nSeparately, in December 2024, the CFPB announced a \nfinal rule that would significantly restrict overdraft fees \nfor certain insured depository institutions, including \nthe Firm (the “CFPB Overdraft Rule”). The rule imposes \ncertain requirements on overdraft protections that are \nsimilar to those that apply to credit cards, unless the \ninstitution prices the overdraft fee at $5 per \ntransaction or the institution’s cost as outlined by the \nCFPB. Refer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on \npages 6-7 for further information. \nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board proposed \nto lower the maximum interchange fee that large debit \ncard issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to \nreceive for a debit card transaction. The proposal \nwould also establish a process for automatically \npublishing an updated maximum fee amount every \nother year going forward. The Firm’s consumer \nactivities are also subject to regulation under state \nPart I\n4\nstatutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or \nempowered agency of each state.\nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P. \nMorgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides retail \ninvestment management services through Nutmeg \nSaving and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is \nregulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg \nare regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct \nof financial services in the U.K., including obligations \nrelating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is \nalso regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator \nwith respect to its operation and use of payment \nsystems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL \nand Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection \nlegislation. \nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation: \nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing \nand brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. \nMorgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-\ndealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to \nregulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock \nExchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar \nsecurities activities outside the U.S. subject to local \nregulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities \nare primarily conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc \nand in the EU, those activities are primarily conducted \nby JPMSE. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and \nregulations covering all aspects of the securities \nbusiness, including sales and trading practices, \nsecurities offerings, publication of research reports, \nuse of customer funds, the financing of client \npurchases, capital structure, record-keeping and \nretention, and the conduct of their directors, officers \nand employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory \ncapital on page 107 for information concerning the \ncapital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan \nSecurities plc and JPMSE. In addition, the Firm's sales \nand trading activities, which are conducted through \nboth bank and non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to \nlaws and regulations relating to market conduct, \nincluding prohibitions on manipulative or anti-\ncompetitive practices.\nInvestment management regulation: \nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses \nare subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions \naround the world relating to, among other things, the \nsafeguarding and management of client assets, \nofferings of funds and marketing activities.

The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities are subject to \nsupervision by the OCC. \nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses \ncontinue to be subject to ongoing rule-making and \nimplementation of new regulations and other \nguidance, including by the SEC and certain U.S. states \nwith respect to enhanced standards of conduct and \nconflicts of interest. In April 2024, the Department of \nLabor (“DOL”) finalized a new “fiduciary” rule that \nwould significantly expand the scope for defining who \ncan be deemed investment advice fiduciaries for \npurposes of retirement plans and individual retirement \naccounts (“IRAs”) under the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act of 1974, as amended (the \n“Fiduciary Rule”). Among the most significant impacts \nof the rule and related amendments to prohibited \ntransaction exemptions would be the impact on the fee \nand compensation practices at financial institutions \nthat offer investment recommendations to retirement \nclients, including in the context of rollovers from an \nemployer plan to an IRA. The effective date of the \nFiduciary Rule has been stayed by two federal courts. \nRefer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on pages \n6-7 for further information. \nDerivatives regulation: \nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its \nderivatives businesses. In the U.S., JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan \nSecurities plc are registered with the CFTC as “swap \ndealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and \nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC \nas “security-based swap dealers”. As a result, these \nentities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory \nframework applicable to their swap or security-based \nswap activities, including capital requirements, rules \nrequiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and \nsecurity-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of \ncounterparty collateral, business conduct and \ndocumentation standards, rules requiring the central \nclearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) \nderivatives, requirements that certain standardized \nOTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, \nrecord-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-\nfraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar \nrequirements have also been established in the \nEuropean Union (“EU”) under the European Market \nInfrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in \nFinancial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as well as \nin the U.K. and other jurisdictions around the world. \nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the \nCFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a \nmember of the National Futures Association. \nData, privacy, cybersecurity and artificial \nintelligence regulation: \nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules \nand regulations globally concerning data, including \ndata protection, consumer protection, privacy, \ncybersecurity, artificial intelligence and related \n5\nmatters. These laws, rules and regulations are \nconstantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a \nfocus of regulators globally, may be enforced by \nprivate parties or government bodies, and continue to \nhave a significant impact on all of the Firm’s \nbusinesses and operations.\nFor example, the Digital Operational Resilience Act \n(DORA) mandates that the Firm’s financial services \nsubsidiaries operating in the EU comply with \nrequirements relating to information and \ncommunications technology (“ICT”) risk management, \nreporting, security control testing and ICT third party \nrisks beginning in January 2025. In addition, the EU \nArtificial Intelligence Act regulates the development \nand deployment of artificial intelligence systems within \nthe EU, with phased-in requirements that began in \nFebruary 2025.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: \nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial \ninstitutions, including banks and securities broker-\ndealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal \ncontrols reasonably designed to prevent money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA \nincludes a variety of record-keeping and reporting \nrequirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-\ncustomer documentation requirements. The Firm is \nalso subject to the regulations and economic \nsanctions programs administered and enforced by the \nU.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(“OFAC”) and EU and U.K. authorities which target \nentities or individuals that are, or are located in \ncountries that are, involved in activities including \nterrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights \nviolations. The Firm is also subject to economic \nsanctions laws, rules and regulations in other \njurisdictions in which it operates, including those that \nconflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorganChase \nfrom complying with certain laws, rules and \nregulations to which it is otherwise subject.\nAnti-Corruption: \nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to \ncorrupt and illegal payments to government officials \nand others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, \nincluding the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and \nthe U.K. Bribery Act.\nCompensation practices: \nThe Firm’s compensation practices are subject to \noversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other \nagencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued \nguidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed \nto ensure that incentive compensation paid by \nbanking organizations does not encourage imprudent \nrisk-taking that threatens the organizations’ safety and \nsoundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has \nalso established standards covering compensation \nprinciples for banks. The Firm’s compensation \npractices are also subject to regulation and oversight \nby regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth \nCapital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as \nimplemented in the EU and as largely adopted in the \nU.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. \nThe European Banking Authority has instituted \nguidelines on compensation policies including under \nCRD V which in certain countries (such as Germany) \nare implemented or supplemented by local regulations \nor guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted \nregulations and guidelines on compensation policies, \nwhich diverge in certain areas from EU rules. The Firm \nexpects that the implementation of regulatory \nguidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and \nother countries will continue to evolve, and may affect \nthe manner in which the Firm structures its \ncompensation programs and practices.\nSustainability:\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and the EU have continued to \nimplement and enhance sustainability-related \ninitiatives and disclosure requirements. The Corporate \nSustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will replace \nand significantly expand the scope and content of \ncertain EU ESG reporting requirements, with phased-\nin requirements expected to start with fiscal year \n2024. The implementation of CSRD into local law has \nbeen delayed in a number of member states, including \nin Germany, and the Firm continues to monitor \ndevelopments and potential impacts. In addition, in \nJuly 2024, the EU enacted the Corporate Sustainability \nDue Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”), which provides for \nphased-in requirements starting in 2027. The CSDDD \nsets mandatory due diligence obligations for \ncompanies to address actual and potential human \nrights violations and environmental adverse impacts \nstemming from their own operations and business \nrelationships, including the activities of certain \ncompanies with which they have established business \nrelationships and also requires the adoption of \ncompany-specific climate-related transition plans. \nBoth the CSRD and CSDDD will impact certain of the \nFirm’s EU and non-EU entities.\nLitigation and regulatory challenges:\nTrade organizations representing the financial \nservices industry and others have filed lawsuits \nchallenging various laws, rules and regulations that, if \nenacted, adopted or implemented, could have \nsignificant adverse impacts on the results of \noperations or compliance costs of financial \ninstitutions, including the Firm. These matters include:\n• Stress tests: The Bank Policy Institute (“BPI”), the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and other trade \norganizations filed an action against the Federal \nReserve in the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of Ohio in December 2024 \nchallenging the manner in which the annual stress \ntesting process is administered.\nPart I\n6\n• CFPB Late Fee Rule: This rule has been stayed \npending resolution of an action challenging the rule \nfiled against the CFPB in the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Texas in March \n2024 by trade organizations including the American \nBankers Association and the Consumer Bankers \nAssociation.\n• CFPB Data Sharing Rule: The BPI, the Kentucky \nBankers Association and other organizations filed an \naction against the CFPB in the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Kentucky in October \n2024 challenging key aspects of this rule.\n• CFPB Overdraft Rule: An action filed by trade \norganizations led by the Mississippi Bankers \nAssociation against the CFPB in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Mississippi \nin December 2024 seeks a preliminary injunction to \nstay the October 1, 2025 effective date of this rule. \nThe CFPB has consented in part to stay the effective \ndate of the rule by 90 days and to temporarily stay \nthe litigation. The preliminary injunction and the stay \nof litigation are pending court approval.\n• Fiduciary Rule: Trade organizations including the \nFederation of Americans for Consumer Choice and \nthe American Council of Life Insurers filed actions \nagainst the DOL seeking to enjoin this rule, and in \nJuly 2024, the effective date of the rule was stayed \nby two United States District Courts.\n7\nHuman capital \nJPMorganChase believes that its long-term growth and success depend on its ability to attract, develop and retain \ntalented employees and foster an inclusive work environment.

The Firm’s hiring practices \nfocus on the skills and qualifications of a candidate \nrelative to the job requirements.\nThe Firm strives to provide both external candidates \nand internal employees who are seeking a different \nrole with challenging and stimulating career \nopportunities. These opportunities range from \ninternship training programs for students to entry-\nlevel, management and executive careers. During \n2024, approximately 56% of the Firm’s employment \nopportunities were filled by external candidates, with \nthe remainder filled by existing employees. \nDeveloping employees\nJPMorganChase supports the professional \ndevelopment and career growth of its employees. The \nFirm requires that its employees, including new hires, \ncomplete a training curriculum which covers, among \nother topics, compliance with the Firm’s Code of \nConduct and information concerning Firm policies and \nstandards, including those relating to cybersecurity.

\nthe ways in which differences in financial services \nregulation and supervision in different jurisdictions \nor with respect to certain competitors can negatively \nimpact JPMorganChase’s business; the ways in \nwhich governmental policies that discourage or \npenalize business relationships with clients in \ncertain industries, or require specific business \npractices, can negatively affect JPMorganChase's \nbusinesses; the penalties and collateral \nconsequences, and higher compliance and \noperational costs, that JPMorganChase may incur \nwhen resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways \nin which less predictable legal and regulatory \nframeworks in certain jurisdictions can negatively \nimpact JPMorganChase’s operations and financial \nresults; and the losses that security holders and \nother unsecured creditors will absorb if \nJPMorganChase were to enter into a resolution.\n• Political risks, including the potential negative \neffects on JPMorganChase’s businesses due to \neconomic uncertainty or instability caused by \npolitical developments.\n• Market risks, including the effects that economic \nand market events and conditions, political \ndevelopments, changes in interest rates and credit \nspreads, and market fluctuations can have on \nJPMorganChase’s consumer and wholesale \nbusinesses and its investment and market-making \npositions and on JPMorganChase’s earnings and its \nliquidity and capital levels.\n• Credit risks, including potential negative effects \nfrom adverse changes in the financial condition of \nclients, customers, counterparties, custodians and \ncentral counterparties;

JPMorganChase must comply \nwith the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its \noperations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in \nwhich it does business, and financial services firms \nsuch as JPMorganChase are subject to extensive and \nconstantly-evolving regulation and supervision.\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorganChase \nsignificantly affects the way that it conducts its \nbusiness and structures its operations, and \nJPMorganChase could be required to make changes to \nits business and operations in response to supervisory \nexpectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, \nrules and regulations. These types of developments \ncould result in JPMorganChase incurring additional \ncosts or experiencing a reduction in revenues to \ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, \nwhich could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, \nJPMorganChase’s entry into or acquisition of a new \nbusiness or an increase in its principal investments \nmay require JPMorganChase to comply with additional \nlaws, rules, and regulations.\nAdditionally, JPMorganChase’s ability to execute \ncertain business initiatives could become more \nchallenging due to increased regulation in the financial \nservices industry, such as limitations on late payment, \noverdraft and interchange fees. This could adversely \naffect JPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer \nbusinesses, prompting the reevaluation or adjustment \nof certain businesses or product offerings, as well as \nthe reallocation of resources and incurrence of \nrestructuring costs, which could impact revenue and \nprofitability in the affected lines of business.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and \nregulations and expanded supervision, \nJPMorganChase has in the past been and could in the \nfuture be, required to:\n• limit the products and services that it offers\n• reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its \nmarket-making activities\n• refrain from engaging in business opportunities that \nit might otherwise pursue\n• pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum \nglobal tax regime), assessments, levies or other \ngovernmental charges, including in connection with \nthe resolution of tax examinations\n• incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent \ntransactions perpetrated against its customers\n• dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or \nprices that are disadvantageous\n• impose restrictions on certain business activities, or\n• increase the prices that it charges for products and \nservices, which could reduce the demand for them.\nAny failure by JPMorganChase to comply with the \nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could \nresult in:\n• increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\n• regulatory and governmental enforcement actions\n• the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions\n• increased exposure to litigation, or\n• harm to its reputation.\n11\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial services \nregulation and supervision can negatively impact \nJPMorganChase’s businesses, operations and \nfinancial results.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and \nregulations affecting financial services firms can vary \naccording to factors such as the size of the firm, the \njurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and \nother criteria. For example:\n• larger firms such as JPMorganChase are often \nsubject to more stringent supervision, regulation \nand regulatory scrutiny\n• financial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to \nbanking regulation, or may be supervised by a \nnational or state regulatory agency that does not \nhave the same resources or regulatory priorities as \nthe regulatory agencies that supervise more \ndiversified financial services firms, or \n• the financial services regulatory and supervisory \nframework in a particular jurisdiction may favor \nfinancial institutions that are based in that \njurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory and \nsupervisory framework can result in JPMorganChase \nlosing market share to competitors that are less \nregulated or not subject to regulation, especially with \nrespect to unregulated financial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways \nthat similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial \nservices industry are implemented in the U.S. and in \nother countries and regions in which JPMorganChase \ndoes business. For example, when adopting rules that \nare intended to implement a global regulatory or \nsupervisory standard, a national regulator may \nintroduce additional or more restrictive requirements, \nwhich can create competitive disadvantages for \nfinancial services firms, such as JPMorganChase, that \nmay be subject to those enhanced regulations.\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national bodies \nand governmental agencies outside the U.S. have \nadopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict \nwith or prohibit JPMorganChase from complying with \nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise \nsubject, creating conflict of law issues that also \nincrease its risk of non-compliance in those \njurisdictions.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. \nhave required and could in the future require \nJPMorganChase to make significant modifications to \nits operations and legal entity structure in the relevant \ncountries or regions in order to comply with those \nrequirements. These include laws, rules and \nregulations that have been adopted or proposed, as \nwell as regulatory expectations, relating to:\n• the establishment of locally-based intermediate \nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\n• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of \ncapital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\n• the implementation of processes within locally-\nbased subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory \nrequirements or expectations\n• the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking \nproducts and services from markets activities\n• requirements for the orderly resolution of financial \ninstitutions\n• requirements for executing or settling transactions \non exchanges or through central counterparties \n(“CCPs”), or for depositing funds with other financial \ninstitutions or clearing and settlement systems\n• position limits and reporting rules for derivatives\n• governance and accountability regimes\n• conduct of business and control requirements, and\n• restrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and \nconflicts in financial services regulation have required \nand could in the future require JPMorganChase to:\n• divest assets or restructure its operations\n• maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, or \nabsorb increased capital and liquidity costs \n• incur higher operational and compliance costs \n• change the prices that it charges for its products and \nservices \n• curtail the products and services that it offers to its \ncustomers and clients\n• curtail other business opportunities, including \nacquisitions or principal investments, that it \notherwise would have pursued\n• become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or \nother sanctions, or\n• incur higher costs for complying with different legal \nand regulatory frameworks. \nAny or all of these factors could harm \nJPMorganChase’s ability to compete against other \nfirms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and \nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm \nJPMorganChase’s businesses, results of operations \nand profitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject \nJPMorganChase to significant penalties and \ncollateral consequences, and could result in higher \ncompliance costs or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorganChase is subject to heightened oversight \nand scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many \njurisdictions. JPMorganChase has paid significant \nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other \nPart I\n12\npenalties and experienced other repercussions in \nconnection with resolving investigations and \nenforcement actions by governmental agencies. \nJPMorganChase could become subject to similar \nregulatory or governmental resolutions or other \nactions in the future, and addressing the requirements \nof any such resolutions or actions could result in \nJPMorganChase incurring higher operational and \ncompliance costs, including devoting substantial \nresources to the required remediation or needing to \ncomply with other restrictions. \nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory \ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain \nregulators have required JPMorganChase and other \nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect \nto the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These \ntypes of admissions can lead to:\n• greater exposure in litigation\n• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation\n• disqualification from doing business with certain \nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\n• other direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, government officials in the U.S. and other \ncountries have demonstrated a willingness to bring \ncriminal actions against financial institutions and have \nrequired that institutions plead guilty to criminal \noffenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with \nresolving regulatory investigations or enforcement \nactions. Resolutions of this type can have significant \ncollateral consequences for the subject financial \ninstitution, including:\n• loss of clients, customers and business\n• restrictions on offering certain products or services, \nand \n• losing permission to operate certain businesses, \neither temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorganChase expects that: \n• it and other financial services firms will continue to \nbe subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and \ngovernmental investigations and enforcement \nactions\n• governmental authorities will continue to require \nthat financial institutions be penalized for actual or \ndeemed violations of law with formal and punitive \nenforcement actions, including the imposition of \nsignificant monetary and other sanctions, rather \nthan resolving these matters through informal \nsupervisory actions, and  \n• governmental authorities will be more likely to \npursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions \nagainst JPMorganChase to the extent that it has \npreviously been subject to other governmental \ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\nIf JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements of \nany resolution of a governmental investigation or \nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control \nprocesses that meet the heightened standards and \nexpectations of its regulators, it could be required to, \namong other things:\n• enter into further resolutions of investigations or \nenforcement actions\n• pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into \njudgments, or\n• accept material regulatory restrictions on, or \nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\nIn these circumstances, JPMorganChase could also \nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution \nor civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave \nrise to an investigation or enforcement action. In \naddition, JPMorganChase can be subject to higher \ncosts or requests for additional capital in connection \nwith the resolution of governmental investigations and \nenforcement actions involving newly-acquired \nbusinesses, companies in which JPMorganChase has \nmade principal investments, parties to joint ventures \nwith JPMorganChase, and vendors with which \nJPMorganChase does business.\nJPMorganChase’s operations and financial results \ncan be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with less \npredictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\nJPMorganChase conducts existing and new business \nin certain countries, states, municipalities, territories \nand other jurisdictions in which the application of the \nrule of law is inconsistent, extralegal or less \npredictable, including with respect to:\n• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or \nguidance for engaging in specific types of business \nor transactions\n• conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules, regulations and \njudicial orders, or the inconsistent application or \ninterpretation of existing laws, rules, regulations and \njudicial precedents\n• actions by or at the direction of government officials \nor agencies\n• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of \nintellectual property rights or contractual or other \nobligations\n• difficulty in competing in economies in which the \ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of \nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where \ngraft or corruption may be pervasive \n• the threat of regulatory investigations, civil \nlitigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary \nor otherwise contrary to established legal principles \nin other parts of the world, and  \n13\n• the termination of licenses required to operate in the \nlocal market or the suspension of business \nrelationships with governmental bodies.\nIf the application of the laws, rules, regulations and \njudicial precedents in any jurisdiction is susceptible to \nproducing outcomes that are inconsistent, unexpected \nor contrary to established legal principles, this can \ncreate a more difficult environment in which \nJPMorganChase conducts its business and could \nnegatively affect JPMorganChase’s operations and \nreduce its earnings with respect to that jurisdiction.  \nFor example, JPMorganChase has faced actual and \nthreatened litigation in Russia with respect to \npayments that JPMorganChase cannot make under, \nand is contractually excused from paying as a result of, \nrelevant economic sanctions laws. That litigation has \nalso resulted in the seizure of assets. In addition, \nconducting business in jurisdictions with less \npredictable legal and regulatory frameworks could \nrequire JPMorganChase to devote significant \nadditional resources to understanding local laws, rules \nand regulations, as well as structuring its operations to \ncomply with local laws, rules and regulations and \nimplementing and administering related internal \npolicies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorganChase will \nalways be successful in its efforts to fully understand \nand to conduct its business in compliance with the \nlaws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in \nwhich it operates, and the risk of non-compliance, or of \ninterference with JPMorganChase's businesses, can be \ngreater in jurisdictions that have less predictable legal \nand regulatory frameworks.\nJPMorganChase's businesses may be negatively \nimpacted by governmental policies that either \ndiscourage or penalize business with certain \nindustries or require specific business practices.\nJPMorganChase's businesses and results of \noperations may be adversely affected by actions or \ninitiatives by national, state or local governmental \nauthorities that:\n• seek to discourage financial institutions from doing \nbusiness with companies engaged in certain \nindustries, or conversely, to penalize financial \ninstitutions that elect not to do business with such \ncompanies, or\n• mandate specific business practices that companies \noperating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction may \ndiffer or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, \nJPMorganChase may face negative consequences \nregardless of the course of action it takes or elects not \nto take, including:\n• restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within \na particular jurisdiction, or with governmental \nentities in a jurisdiction\n• the threat of enforcement actions, including under \nantitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and \nregulations, and\n• harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, \nincluding from politicians, activists and other \nstakeholders.\nJPMorganChase has been prohibited from engaging in \ncertain business activities in specific jurisdictions as a \nresult of these types of governmental actions, and \nthere is no assurance that it will not face similar \nrestrictions on its business and operations in the \nfuture.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of \nJPMorganChase could result in JPMorganChase \nhaving to restructure or reorganize its businesses \nand could increase its funding or operational costs or \ncurtail its businesses.\nJPMorganChase is required under Federal Reserve \nand FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to \nthose agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly \nresolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary \ngovernment support, in the event of material financial \ndistress or failure. The evaluation of JPMorganChase’s \nresolution plan by these agencies may change, and the \nrequirements for resolution plans may be modified \nfrom time to time. Any such determinations or \nmodifications could result in JPMorganChase needing \nto make changes to its legal entity structure or to \ncertain internal or external activities, which could \nincrease its funding or operational costs, or hamper its \nability to serve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to \ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by \nJPMorganChase has deficiencies, they could jointly \nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity \nrequirements or restrictions on JPMorganChase’s \ngrowth, activities or operations. The agencies could \nalso require that JPMorganChase restructure, \nreorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that \ncould materially and adversely affect \nJPMorganChase’s operations and strategy. \nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity \nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a \nresolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & \nCo. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels \nof unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) \nfor purposes of recapitalizing JPMorganChase’s \noperating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to \nenter into a resolution either: \n• in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  \n• in a receivership administered by the FDIC under \nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  \nPart I\n14\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, \nholders of eligible LTD, other unsecured creditors and \nholders of equity securities of the Parent Company will \nabsorb the losses of the Parent Company and its \nsubsidiaries. \nThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under \nJPMorganChase’s resolution plan contemplates that \nthe Parent Company would enter bankruptcy \nproceedings and JPMorganChase’s material \nsubsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that \nthey could continue normal operations or \nsubsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly \nmanner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and \nany losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be \nimposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s \nequity securities and thereafter on its unsecured \ncreditors, including holders of eligible LTD. Claims of \nthe Parent Company's shareholders and unsecured \ncreditors would have a junior position to the claims of \ncreditors of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries and to the \nclaims of priority (as determined by statute) and \nsecured creditors of the Parent Company.   \nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in \nbankruptcy, unsecured creditors of the Parent \nCompany, including holders of eligible LTD of the \nParent Company, would realize value only to the extent \navailable to the Parent Company as a shareholder of \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, \nand only after any claims of priority and secured \ncreditors of the Parent Company have been fully \nrepaid. \nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of \nentry recapitalization model would be its expected \nstrategy to resolve a systemically important financial \ninstitution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. \nHowever, the FDIC has not formally adopted or \ncommitted to any specific resolution strategy. \nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, \na resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal \nReserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow \nJPMorganChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and \nlosses to unsecured creditors of the Parent Company, \nincluding holders of eligible LTD, and to holders of \nequity securities of the Parent Company, under \nwhatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be \ngreater than they might have been under \nJPMorganChase’s preferred strategy.  \nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by \npolitical and geopolitical developments can \nnegatively impact JPMorganChase’s businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries \ncan cause uncertainty in the economic environment \nand market conditions in which JPMorganChase \noperates its businesses. Certain governmental policy \ninitiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, \ncould significantly affect U.S. and global economic \ngrowth and cause higher volatility in the financial \nmarkets, including:\n• monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal \nReserve and other central banks or governmental \nauthorities, including changes in interest rate levels \nand any sustained large-scale asset purchases or \nany suspension or reversal of those actions\n• fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and \nspending\n• isolationist foreign policies\n• economic or financial sanctions\n• the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist \ntrade policies\n• changes to immigration policies, or\n• actions that the government takes or fails to take in \nresponse to the effects of health emergencies, the \nspread of infectious diseases, epidemics or \npandemics.\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty \nabout the possible outcomes of these developments, \ncould:\n• erode investor or consumer confidence in the U.S. \neconomy and financial markets, which could \npotentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as \na safe haven currency\n• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other \ncountries and otherwise heighten tensions in \nregulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations\n• increase the risk of targeted cyber attacks\n• increase concerns about whether the U.S. \ngovernment will be funded, and its outstanding debt \nserviced, at any particular time\n• result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government \n• influence investor perceptions concerning \ngovernment support of certain sectors of the \neconomy or the economy as a whole\n• influence monetary policy actions of the Federal \nReserve to moderate the economic impact of \npolitical developments, including decisions on \ninterest rate levels and asset purchases and sales\n• adversely affect the financial condition or credit \nratings of clients and counterparties with which \nJPMorganChase does business, or\n• cause JPMorganChase to refrain from engaging in \nbusiness opportunities that it might otherwise \npursue.\nThese factors could lead to:\n• slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession\n• disruptions in labor markets\n• greater market volatility\n15\n• a contraction of available credit and the widening of \ncredit spreads\n• U.S. dollar currency fluctuations\n• lower investments in a particular country or sector of \nthe economy\n• large-scale sales of government debt and other debt \nand equity securities\n• reduced commercial activity among trading partners \nor disruptions to supply chains, or\n• the possible departure of a country from, or the \ndissolution or formation of, a political or economic \nalliance or treaty.\nUnder certain circumstances, such as geopolitically \nchallenging situations in regions like Russia, the \nMiddle East and China, these various risks could \nbecome highly correlated or combine in \nunprecedented ways.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause \nJPMorganChase to suffer losses on its market-making \npositions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its \nliquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for \ncredit losses or lead to higher net charge-offs, hamper \nits ability to deliver products and services to its clients \nand customers, and weaken its results of operations \nand financial condition or credit rating.\nMarket\nEconomic and market events and conditions can \nmaterially affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and \ninvestment and market-making positions.\nJPMorganChase’s results of operations can be \nnegatively affected by adverse changes in any of the \nfollowing:\n• investor, consumer and business sentiment\n• events that reduce confidence in the financial \nmarkets\n• inflation, deflation or recession\n• high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening \nlabor market\n• the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit\n• levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads \nand market prices for currencies, debt and equity \nsecurities and commodities, as well as the duration \nof any such changes\n• the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of \nwar, hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical \ninstabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural \ndisasters, severe weather conditions, health \nemergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, \nepidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary \nevents beyond JPMorganChase’s control, and\n• the state of the U.S. and global economies.\nAll of these are affected by global economic, market \nand political events and conditions, including \nmonetary policies and actions taken by central banks \nor other governmental authorities, as well as by the \nregulatory environment.\nIn addition, JPMorganChase’s investment portfolio and \nmarket-making businesses can suffer losses due to \nunanticipated market events, including:\n• severe declines in asset values\n• unexpected credit events\n• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause \npreviously uncorrelated factors to become \ncorrelated (and vice versa)\n• the inability to effectively hedge risks related to \nmarket-making and investment portfolio positions, \nor\n• other market risks that may not have been \nappropriately taken into account in the \ndevelopment, structuring or pricing of a financial \ninstrument.\nIf JPMorganChase experiences significant losses in its \ninvestment portfolio or from market-making activities, \nthis could reduce JPMorganChase’s profitability and \nits liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain \nthe growth of its businesses.\nJPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can be \nnegatively affected by adverse economic conditions \nand governmental policies.\nJPMorganChase’s consumer businesses are \nparticularly affected by U.S. and global economic \nconditions, including:\n• personal and household income distribution\n• unemployment or underemployment\n• prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low \ninterest rates, or significant changes to interest rates\n• changes in the value of collateral such as residential \nreal estate and vehicles\n• changes in housing prices\n• the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods \nand services\n• consumer and small business confidence levels, and\n• changes in consumer spending or in the level of \nconsumer debt.\nHeightened levels of unemployment or \nunderemployment that result in reduced personal and \nhousehold income could negatively affect consumer \ncredit performance to the extent that consumers are \nless able to service their debts. In addition, sustained \nlow growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary \npressures or recessionary conditions could diminish \ncustomer demand for the products and services \noffered by JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses. \nPart I\n16\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an \nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the allowance \nfor credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can \nreduce JPMorganChase’s earnings. These \nconsequences could be significantly worse in certain \ngeographies, including where declining industrial or \nmanufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in \nhigher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of \nconsumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, \ncould impair the ability of customers to pay their other \nconsumer loan obligations.\nJPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer \nbusinesses could also be adversely affected by \ngovernmental policies and actions that affect \nconsumers, including:\n• policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, \neducation, immigration and housing, or that may \nimpact employment status\n• laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the \nfinancial services industry, such as limitations on late \npayment, overdraft and interchange fees, and\n• policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such \nas higher taxes and increased regulation, which \ncould result in reductions in consumer disposable \nincome.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can \nhave an adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s \nwholesale businesses.\nIn JPMorganChase’s wholesale businesses, market \nand economic factors can affect the volume of \ntransactions that JPMorganChase executes for its \nclients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, \nthe revenue that JPMorganChase receives from those \ntransactions. These factors can also influence the \nwillingness of other financial institutions and investors \nto participate in capital markets transactions that \nJPMorganChase manages, such as loan syndications \nor securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant \nand sustained deterioration in market conditions were \nto occur, the profitability of JPMorganChase’s \nbusinesses engaged in capital markets activities, \nincluding loan syndication, securities underwriting and \nleveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the \nextent that those businesses:\n• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction \nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or \nunable to refinance their outstanding debt \nobligations in unfavorable market conditions, or\n• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, \nor hold larger residual positions in credit \ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable \nprices.\nThe fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing \nclient assets or holding assets under custody for \nclients could be diminished by declining asset values \nor other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For \nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in \nfinancial markets could affect the valuation of client \nassets that JPMorganChase manages or holds under \ncustody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorganChase’s \nrevenue from fees that are based on the amount of \nassets under management or custody. Similarly, \nadverse macroeconomic or market conditions could \nprompt outflows from JPMorganChase funds or \naccounts, or cause clients to invest in products that \ngenerate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected \nwithdrawals from a JPMorganChase fund can also \nhamper the investment performance of the fund, \nparticularly if the outflows create the need for the fund \nto dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or \nprices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on \nthe weaker investment performance.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular \nsegments of the economy, such as a sudden and \nsevere downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in \ncommodity prices, severe declines in commercial real \nestate values, or sustained changes in consumer \nbehavior that affect specific economic sectors, could \nhave a material adverse effect on clients of \nJPMorganChase whose operations or financial \ncondition are directly or indirectly dependent on the \nhealth or stability of those market segments or \neconomic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged \nin related businesses. JPMorganChase could incur \ncredit losses on its loans and other commitments to \nclients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector \nof the economy that is or comes under stress.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in \nconsumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer \nand business spending could also have a negative \nimpact on certain of JPMorganChase’s wholesale \nclients, and thereby diminish JPMorganChase’s \nearnings from its wholesale operations. For example, \nthe businesses of certain of JPMorganChase’s \nwholesale clients are dependent on consistent \nstreams of rental income from commercial real estate \nproperties, including offices, which are owned or being \nbuilt by those clients. Sustained adverse economic \nconditions or hybrid work models could result in \nreductions in the rental cash flows that owners or \ndevelopers receive from their tenants which, in turn, \ncould depress the values of the properties, impair the \nability of borrowers to service or refinance their \ncommercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in \nforeclosures. These consequences could result in \nJPMorganChase experiencing increases in the \nallowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, \ndefaults and charge-offs within its commercial real \nestate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for \nservicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that \nportfolio. An increase in foreclosures could result in \nhigher operational risk associated with \nJPMorganChase owning and managing real property, \n17\nand any inadequacy in governance or control over the \nforeclosed properties could result in regulatory \nscrutiny and reputational harm.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can \nadversely affect JPMorganChase’s earnings, its \nliquidity or its capital levels. \nWhen interest rates are high or increasing, \nJPMorganChase can generally be expected to earn \nhigher net interest income. However, higher interest \nrates can also lead to:\n• fewer originations of commercial and residential real \nestate loans \n• losses on underwriting exposures or incremental \nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the \nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due \nto higher financing costs for clients\n• the loss of deposits, particularly if customers \nwithdraw deposits because they believe that interest \nrates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than \nthose of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes \nincorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\n• losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in \nthe investment securities portfolio\n• lower net interest income if central banks introduce \ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated \nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of \nshort-term and long-term borrowings\n• less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n• higher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect \nJPMorganChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital \nlevels, and any negative outcomes could be more \nsevere in a prolonged period of high interest rates. \nHigher interest rates can also negatively affect the \npayment performance on loans within \nJPMorganChase’s consumer and wholesale loan \nportfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If \nborrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford \nhigher interest payments, those borrowers may \nreduce or stop making payments, thereby causing \nJPMorganChase to incur losses and increased \noperational costs related to servicing a higher volume \nof delinquent loans. \nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate \nenvironment may cause:\n• net interest margins to be compressed, which could \nreduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on \nits investment securities portfolio to the extent that it \nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\n• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor \nbehavior, which could negatively affect \nJPMorganChase’s broader asset and liability \nmanagement strategy, and\n• a reduction in the value of JPMorganChase’s \nmortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, resulting \nin decreased revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more \nexpensive for JPMorganChase to borrow. \nJPMorganChase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow \nnot only in response to events and circumstances that \nare specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of \ngeneral economic and geopolitical events and \nconditions. Changes in JPMorganChase’s credit \nspreads will affect, positively or negatively, \nJPMorganChase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such \nas derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. \nJPMorganChase’s results may be materially affected \nby market fluctuations and significant changes in the \nvaluation of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other financial \ninstruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it \nmakes markets can be materially affected by market \nfluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market \nconditions and other disruptions in the financial \nmarkets may make it extremely difficult to value \ncertain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of \nfinancial instruments in future periods, in light of \nfactors then prevailing, may result in significant \nchanges in the value of these instruments. In addition, \nat the time of any disposition of these financial \ninstruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately \nrealizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the \nmarket at that time and may be materially lower than \ntheir current fair value. Any of these factors could \ncause a decline in the value of financial instruments \nthat JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes \nmarkets, which may have an adverse effect on \nJPMorganChase’s results of operations.\nJPMorganChase’s risk management and monitoring \nprocesses, including its stress testing framework, seek \nto quantify and manage JPMorganChase’s exposure to \nmore extreme market moves. However, \nJPMorganChase’s hedging and other risk \nmanagement strategies may not be effective, and it \ncould incur significant losses, if extreme market events \nwere to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by \nadverse changes in the financial condition of clients, \ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with \nclients and counterparties such as corporations, \nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, \nsecurities exchanges and government entities within \nand outside the U.S. Many of these transactions \nexpose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients \nand counterparties, and can involve JPMorganChase in \ndisputes and litigation if a client or counterparty \ndefaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses \nPart I\n18\nor liability where a financial institution that it has \nappointed to provide custodial services for client \nassets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud \nor the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, \nor where clients are unable to access assets held by \nJPMorganChase as custodian due to governmental \nactions or other factors.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a \nCCP through which JPMorganChase executes \ncontracts would require JPMorganChase to replace \nthose contracts, thereby increasing its operational \ncosts and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, \nJPMorganChase can be exposed to losses if a member \nof a CCP in which JPMorganChase is also a member \ndefaults on its obligations to the CCP because of \nrequirements that each member of the CCP absorb a \nportion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorganChase \ncan be subject to bearing its share of non-default \nlosses incurred by a CCP, including losses from \ncustodial, settlement or investment activities or due to \ncyber or other security breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, \nJPMorganChase is exposed to the risk of \nnonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to \nmitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate \ncollateral. JPMorganChase is also exposed to intra-day \ncredit risk of its clients in connection with providing \ncash management, clearing, custodial and other \ntransaction services to those clients. If a client for \nwhich JPMorganChase provides these services \nbecomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorganChase may \nincur losses, become involved in disputes and \nlitigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s \nbankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to \nregulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events \ncan increase JPMorganChase’s operational and \nlitigation costs, and JPMorganChase may suffer losses \nto the extent that any collateral that it has received is \ninsufficient to cover those losses.\nTransactions with government entities, including \nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local \nauthorities, can expose JPMorganChase to enhanced \nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. \nGovernment entities may, among other things, claim \nthat actions taken by government officials were \nbeyond the legal authority of those officials or \nrepudiate transactions authorized by a previous \nincumbent government. These types of actions have in \nthe past caused, and could in the future cause, \nJPMorganChase to suffer losses or hamper its ability \nto conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit \nJPMorganChase’s ability to resolve disputes and \nlitigation in the event of a counterparty default or \nunwillingness to make previously agreed-upon \npayments, which could subject JPMorganChase to \nlosses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives \ncontracts with regard to the terms, the settlement \nprocedures or the value of underlying collateral. The \ndisposition of those disputes could cause \nJPMorganChase to incur unexpected transaction, \noperational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. \nThese consequences can also impair \nJPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage its \ncredit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause \nharm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant \nmarket participant, such as a major financial institution \nor a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of \nsuch a market participant or its ability to fulfill its \nobligations, can cause substantial and cascading \ndisruption within the financial markets, including in \ncircumstances where coordinated action by multiple \nother market participants is required to address the \nfailure or disruption. JPMorganChase’s businesses \ncould be significantly disrupted by such an event, \nparticularly if it leads to other market participants \nincurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity \nissues or defaulting, and JPMorganChase is likely to \nhave significant interrelationships with, and credit \nexposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorganChase may suffer losses if the value of \ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, \nJPMorganChase’s credit risk may be further increased \nwhen:\n• JPMorganChase fails to realize the estimated value \nof the collateral it holds\n• collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient \nto recover the full amount owed to it, or\n• counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether \nfor operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning \nthe valuation of collateral may increase in times of \nsignificant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and \nJPMorganChase could suffer losses during these \nperiods if it is unable to realize the fair value of \ncollateral or to manage declines in the value of \ncollateral.\nJPMorganChase could incur significant losses \narising from concentrations of credit and market \nrisk.\nJPMorganChase is exposed to greater credit and \nmarket risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or \ncounterparties, or obligors on securities and other \nfinancial instruments:\n• engage in similar or related businesses, or in \nbusinesses in related industries\n• do business in the same geographic region, or\n19\n• have business profiles, models or strategies that \ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations to \nbe similarly affected by changes in economic \nconditions. \nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit \nquality of a counterparty, borrower or other obligor \ncould lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of \nother counterparties, borrowers or obligors in similar, \nrelated or dependent industries. This type of \ninterrelationship could exacerbate JPMorganChase’s \ncredit, liquidity and market risk exposure and \npotentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value \nlosses in its market-making businesses and \ninvestment portfolios. In addition, JPMorganChase \nmay be required to increase the allowance for credit \nlosses or establish other reserves with respect to \ncertain clients, industries or country exposures in \norder to align with directives or expectations of its \nbanking regulators. \nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect \na particular industry or geographic area could lead to \nconcerns about the credit quality of counterparties, \nborrowers or other obligors not only in that particular \nindustry or geography but in related or dependent \nindustries, wherever located. These conditions could \nalso heighten concerns about the ability of customers \nof JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses who live in \nthose areas or work in those affected industries or \nrelated or dependent industries to meet their \nobligations to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase \nregularly monitors various segments of its credit and \nmarket risk exposures to assess the potential risks of \nconcentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify \nor hedge its exposure against those risks may be \nlimited.\nJPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can also be \nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit \nby bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened \ncompetition for certain types of consumer loans could \nprompt industry-wide reactions such as significant \nreductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or \nthe making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If \nlarge numbers of consumers subsequently default on \ntheir loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an \neconomic downturn or other factors, this could impair \ntheir ability to repay obligations owed to \nJPMorganChase and result in higher charge-offs and \nother credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread \ndefaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary \nconditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorganChase’s \nconsumer businesses may earn lower revenues in \nsuch an environment.\nIf JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions \neffectively during a market dislocation, this can \nincrease both the market and credit risks associated \nwith those positions and the level of risk-weighted-\nassets (“RWA”) that JPMorganChase holds on its \nbalance sheet. These factors could adversely affect \nJPMorganChase’s capital position, funding costs and \nthe profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses \ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. \nJPMorganChase’s liquidity can be impacted at any \ngiven time as a result of factors such as:\n• market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n• changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting \nfrom changes in laws, rules and regulations, \nincluding those in response to economic effects of \nsystemic events\n• actions taken by the U.S. government or by the \nFederal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which \nmay reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and \nother financial institutions\n• inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable \ntimes or prices\n• default by a CCP or other significant market \nparticipant\n• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n• unexpected loss of deposits or higher than \nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments, \nand\n• lack of market or customer confidence in \nJPMorganChase or financial institutions in general. \nA reduction in JPMorganChase’s liquidity may be \ncaused by events over which it has little or no control. \nFor example, periods of market stress, low investor \nconfidence and significant market illiquidity could \nresult in higher funding costs for JPMorganChase and \ncould limit its access to some of its traditional sources \nof liquidity. \nJPMorganChase may need to raise funding from \nalternative sources if its access to stable and lower-\ncost sources of funding, such as deposits and \nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is \nreduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more \nexpensive or limited in availability. JPMorganChase’s \nfunding costs could also be negatively affected by \nactions that JPMorganChase may take in order to:\n• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net \nstable funding ratio requirements\n• address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n• satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions \noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of \nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal \nentities.\nMore generally, if JPMorganChase fails to effectively \nmanage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to \nfund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and \nthereby adversely affect its results of operations.\nPart I\n20\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and \ndepends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make \npayments on its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that \nholds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an \nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase \nHoldings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally \nholds the stock of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other \nthan JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. \nThe IHC also owns other assets and provides \nintercompany lending to the Parent Company. \nThe Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the \nIHC substantially all the net proceeds received from \nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior and \nsubordinated debt securities and of preferred and \ncommon stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC \nto make payments to the Parent Company is also \nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to \nregulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as \nwell as capital adequacy requirements, such as the \nSupplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity \nrequirements and other regulatory restrictions on its \nability to make payments to the Parent Company. The \nIHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending \ncredit to the Parent Company if certain capital or \nliquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are \notherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s \nmanagement or Board of Directors. \nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the \nParent Company to make various payments is \ndependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from \nthe IHC. These limitations could affect the Parent \nCompany’s ability to:\n• pay interest on its debt securities\n• pay dividends on its equity securities\n• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\n• fulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese arrangements could also result in the Parent \nCompany seeking protection under bankruptcy laws \nor otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a \ntime earlier than would have been the case absent the \nexistence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to \nwhich JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are \nsubject.\nReductions in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings may \nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal \nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating \nagencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry-\nspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a \nparticular financial institution, including:\n• expected future profitability \n• risk management practices\n• legal expenses\n• ratings differentials between bank holding \ncompanies and their bank and non-bank \nsubsidiaries\n• regulatory developments \n• assumptions about government support, and \n• economic and geopolitical developments. \nJPMorganChase closely monitors and manages, to the \nextent that it is able, factors that could influence its \ncredit ratings. However, there is no assurance that \nJPMorganChase’s credit ratings will not be \ndowngraded in the future. Furthermore, any such \ndowngrade could occur at times of broader market \ninstability when JPMorganChase’s options for \nresponding to events may be more limited and general \ninvestor confidence is low.\nA reduction in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings could \ncurtail JPMorganChase’s business activities and \nreduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:\n• reducing its access to capital markets \n• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing \nsecurities \n• triggering additional collateral or funding \nrequirements, and \n• decreasing the number of investors and \ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do \nbusiness with or lend to JPMorganChase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit \nspreads charged by the market for taking credit risk \non JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This \ncould, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and \nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its \nsubsidiaries.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of \ncapital may impact JPMorganChase’s ability to \nsupport business activities, meet evolving \nregulatory requirements and distribute capital to \nshareholders.\nJPMorganChase is subject to various regulatory \ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements. In addition, as a Global \nSystemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorganChase \nis required to hold additional capital buffers, including \na GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a \ncountercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at \nleast annually. The amount of capital that \nJPMorganChase is required to hold in order to satisfy \nthese leverage- and risk-based requirements could \nincrease at any given time due to factors such as:\n• actions by banking regulators, including changes in \nlaws, rules and regulations\n21\n• changes in the composition of JPMorganChase’s \nbalance sheet or developments that could increase \nRWA, such as increased market risk, customer \ndelinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or \nother factors, and\n• increases in estimated stress losses as determined \nby the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive \nCapital Analysis and Review, which could increase \nJPMorganChase’s SCB.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to \nmaintain the required level and composition of capital, \nor unfavorable changes in applicable capital \nrequirements, could have an adverse impact on \nJPMorganChase’s shareholders, such as:\n• reducing the amount of common stock that \nJPMorganChase is permitted to repurchase\n• requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the \nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner \ninconsistent with JPMorganChase’s capital \nmanagement strategy\n• constraining the amount of dividends that may be \npaid on common stock, or\n• curtailing JPMorganChase’s business activities or \noperations.\nIn 2023, U.S. banking regulators released a proposal to \nimplement the final Basel III reforms which would have \nsignificantly revised the risk-based capital \nrequirements for banks with assets of $100 billion or \nmore, including JPMorganChase. In addition, in 2023 \nthe Federal Reserve released a proposal to amend the \ncalculation of the GSIB surcharge. Uncertainty remains \nregarding the content of the final versions of these rule \nproposals and how they might ultimately apply to \nJPMorganChase. However, it is possible that the final \nrules could impact JPMorganChase’s decisions \nconcerning the business activities in which it will \nengage and its levels of capital distributions to its \nshareholders. \nOperational\nJPMorganChase’s businesses are dependent on the \neffectiveness of internal and external operational \nsystems.\nJPMorganChase’s businesses rely on the ability of \nJPMorganChase’s financial, accounting, transaction \nexecution, data processing and other operational \nsystems, including devices supporting those systems, \nto process, record, monitor and report a large number \nof transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so \naccurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper \ndesign, installation, maintenance and training, the \neffective functioning of JPMorganChase’s operational \nsystems depends on:\n• the quality of the information contained in those \nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or \ncorrupted data can significantly compromise the \nfunctionality or reliability of a particular system and \nother systems to which it transmits or from which it \nreceives information, and\n• JPMorganChase’s ability to continue to maintain and \nupgrade its systems on a regular and timely basis in \nline with technological advancements and evolving \nsecurity requirements, maintain security and \noperational continuity of its systems, including by \ncarefully managing any changes introduced to its \nsystems, prevent unauthorized access and the \nmisuse of access to its systems, and adhere to all \napplicable legal and regulatory requirements, \nparticularly in regions where JPMorganChase may \nface a heightened risk of malicious activity.\nJPMorganChase has experienced and expects that it \nwill continue to experience failures and disruptions in \nthe stability of its operational systems, including \ndegraded performance of data processing systems, \ndata quality issues, disruptions of network connectivity \nand malfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in \nits ability to access and use the operational systems of \nthird parties and interruptions in service from third-\nparty service providers. These incidents have resulted \nin various negative effects for customers, including the \ninability to access account information or transact \nthrough ATM, internet or mobile channels, the \nexfiltration of customer personal data, the recording of \nduplicative transactions and extended delays for \ncustomers requiring services from call centers. There \ncan be no assurance that these and other types of \noperational failures or disruptions will not occur in the \nfuture.\nJPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage the \nstability of its operational systems and infrastructure \ncould be hindered by many factors, any of which could \nhave a negative impact on JPMorganChase and its \nclients, customers and counterparties, including:\n• JPMorganChase’s ability to effectively maintain and \nupgrade systems and infrastructure can become \nmore challenging as the speed, frequency, volume, \ninterconnectivity and complexity of transactions \ncontinue to increase\n• attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorganChase \nor its clients and customers continue to increase, \nevolve and become more complex, and during \nperiods of market disruption or economic \nuncertainty, these attempts can be expected to \nfurther increase in volume\n• errors made by JPMorganChase or another market \nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious, could \ncause widespread system disruption\n• failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in \noperational systems in a timely manner\n• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in \noperational systems could compound, or migrate to \nother systems over time, to become larger issues\nPart I\n22\n• disruptions in operational systems or in the ability of \nsystems to communicate with each other could be \ncaused by failures in synchronization or encryption \nsoftware, or degraded performance of \nmicroprocessors, and\n• attempts by third parties to block the use of key \ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use \ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\nJPMorganChase also depends on its ability to access \nand use the operational systems of third parties, \nincluding its custodians, vendors (such as those that \nprovide data and cloud computing services, and \nsecurity and technology services) and other market \nparticipants (such as clearing and payment systems, \nCCPs and securities exchanges). These external \noperational systems with which JPMorgan is \nconnected, whether directly or indirectly, can be \nsources of operational risk to JPMorganChase. \nJPMorganChase may be exposed not only to a \nsystems failure or cyber attack that may be \nexperienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with \nwhich JPMorganChase is directly connected, but also \nto a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving \nanother party to which such a vendor or infrastructure \nis connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and \nprocessors, data aggregators and other external \nparties with which JPMorganChase’s customers do \nbusiness can increase JPMorganChase’s operational \nrisk. This is particularly the case where activities of \ncustomers or other parties are beyond \nJPMorganChase’s security and control systems, \nincluding through the use of the internet, cloud \ncomputing services, and personal smart phones and \nother mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer \naccount data on JPMorganChase’s systems, whether \nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party \nmisappropriates that data, this could result in negative \noutcomes for JPMorganChase and its clients and \ncustomers, including a heightened risk of fraudulent \ntransactions using JPMorganChase’s systems, losses \nfrom fraudulent transactions and reputational harm \narising from the perception that JPMorganChase’s \nsystems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorganChase’s interconnectivity with clients, \ncustomers and other external parties continues to \nexpand, JPMorganChase increasingly faces the risk of \noperational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the \nsystems of those parties. Security breaches affecting \nJPMorganChase’s clients or customers, or systems \nbreakdowns or failures, security breaches or human \nerror or misconduct affecting other external parties, \nmay require JPMorganChase to take steps to protect \nthe integrity of its own operational systems or to \nsafeguard confidential information, including \nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts. \nThese actions can increase JPMorganChase’s \noperational costs and potentially diminish customer \nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorganChase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding \ninterconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing \nbanks, CCPs, payments processors, financial \ntechnology companies, securities exchanges, clearing \nhouses and other financial market infrastructures \nincreases the risk that the disruption of an operational \nsystem involving one institution or entity, including \ndue to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide \noperational disruptions that could materially affect \nJPMorganChase’s ability to conduct business. In \naddition, the risks associated with the disruption of an \noperational system of a third party could be \nexacerbated to the extent that the services provided \nby that system are used by a significant number or \nproportion of market participants.\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of \noperational systems upon which JPMorganChase \ndepends, including due to a systems malfunction, \ncyber incident or other systems failure, could result in \nunfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and \nfor JPMorganChase and its clients and customers, \nincluding:\n• delays or other disruptions in providing services, \nincluding the provision of liquidity or information to \nclients and customers\n• impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to execute \ntransactions, including delays or failures in the \nconfirmation or settlement of transactions or in \nobtaining access to funds or other assets required \nfor settlement\n• the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets \ntrades or other transactions are executed \nerroneously\n• financial losses, including due to loss-sharing \nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other \nmarket infrastructures, or as possible restitution to \nclients and customers\n• higher operational costs associated with replacing \nservices provided by a system that has experienced \na failure or other disruption \n• limitations on JPMorganChase's ability to collect \ndata needed for its business and operations\n• loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorganChase, \nor financial institutions generally, to protect against \nand withstand operational disruptions\n• dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients or \ncustomers\n• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory \nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and \n• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nIf JPMorganChase’s operational systems, or those of \nacquired businesses or of external parties on which \n23\nJPMorganChase’s businesses depend, are unable to \nmeet the requirements of JPMorganChase’s \nbusinesses and operations or bank regulatory \nstandards, or if they fail or have other significant \nshortcomings, JPMorganChase could be materially \nand adversely affected.\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorganChase \ncould cause significant harm to JPMorganChase and \nits clients and customers.\nJPMorganChase experiences numerous cyber attacks \non its computer systems, software, networks and other \ntechnology assets on a daily basis from various actors, \nincluding groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, \ncyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or \ngroups that use technology to promote a political \nagenda or social change) and others. These cyber \nattacks can take many forms, including attempts to \nintroduce computer viruses or malicious code, which \nare commonly referred to as “malware,” into \nJPMorganChase’s systems. These attacks are often \ndesigned to:\n• obtain unauthorized access to JPMorganChase's \nsystems or to confidential information belonging to \nJPMorganChase or its clients, customers, \ncounterparties or employees\n• manipulate data\n• destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering \nservices unavailable\n• disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on \nJPMorganChase’s systems\n• steal money, or\n• extort money through the use of so-called \n“ransomware.”\nJPMorganChase also experiences:\n• distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to \ndisrupt JPMorganChase’s websites, including those \nthat provide online banking and other services,\n• a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks \nagainst the backdrop of heightened geopolitical \ntensions, and\n• a high volume of disruptions to internet-based \nservices used by JPMorganChase that are provided \nby third parties.\nJPMorganChase has experienced security breaches \ndue to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that \nadditional breaches will occur in the future. Any such \nbreach could result in serious and harmful \nconsequences for JPMorganChase or its clients and \ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorganChase cannot \nprovide absolute security against cyber attacks is that \nit may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or \nrecognize threats to JPMorganChase’s systems, or to \nimplement effective preventive measures against all \nbreaches due to evolving risks, including:\n• the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve \nfrequently and increase in sophistication, and \ntherefore may not be recognized until launched or \nmay go undetected for extended periods\n• cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of \nsources, including JPMorganChase’s own \nemployees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups \nlinked to terrorist organizations or hostile nation-\nstates that can sustain malicious activities for \nextended periods, or third parties whose objective is \nto disrupt the operations of financial institutions \nmore generally\n• JPMorganChase does not have control over the \ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of \nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party \nservice providers with which it does business, and\n• it is possible that a third party, after establishing a \nfoothold on an internal network without being \ndetected, may gain access to other networks and \nsystems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack \ncould increase in the future due to factors such as: \n• JPMorganChase’s ongoing expansion of its digital \nbanking and other internet-based product offerings \nand its internal use of internet-based products and \napplications, including those that use cloud \ncomputing services\n• advances in artificial intelligence, such as the use of \nmachine learning, generative artificial intelligence \nand quantum computing by malicious actors to \ndevelop more advanced social engineering attacks, \nincluding targeted phishing attacks\n• the inability to maintain the security of information \ntransmitted by JPMorganChase due to advances in \nquantum computing that may counteract or nullify \nexisting information protections, and\n• the acquisition and integration of new businesses.\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate \nconfidential information obtained by intercepting \nsignals or communications from mobile devices used \nby JPMorganChase’s employees.\nThe dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape, \nincluding the pace of innovation and increased threat \nof novel attack methods, necessitates ongoing \ninvestment in, as well as enhancement and adaptation \nof, cybersecurity controls, including the adoption of \nenhanced security measures in certain jurisdictions. \nFailure to discover or address emerging threats, \nknown vulnerabilities or shortcomings in cybersecurity \ncontrols, or to prioritize or complete enhancements to \naddress them, in each case in a timely manner, may \nleave JPMorganChase vulnerable to cyber attacks, \npotentially resulting in data breaches, financial losses, \nPart I\n24\nreputational damage and regulatory penalties, \nincluding the failure to prioritize or complete \nenhancements relating to:\n• preventing unauthorized access and protecting \nagainst the misuse of access, including the \nmaintenance and enhancement of controls related \nto secure software development practices and \nidentity and access management, such as those \nrelating to the management of administrative access \nto systems\n• detecting, escalating and addressing effectively and \nin a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may be \npresent either in internally-developed software or \nexternally-provided software or services, including \nvulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit \nunknown security flaws in software and hardware \n(“zero-day vulnerabilities”)\n• oversight of third-party vendors and early detection \nof attacks against those vendors, including \nransomware attacks and attacks targeting \nvulnerabilities in third-party open-source software, \nin support of the secure development and \nmaintenance of internal systems\n• maintaining and enhancing controls related to \ntechnology asset management and inventory \nsystems to prevent the risk of undetected \nvulnerabilities that could undermine \nJPMorganChase’s ability to operate an effective \ncontrol process \n• upgrading the coverage and capabilities of systems \nand controls to protect JPMorganChase and its \nclients and customers from the impact of distributed \ndenial-of-service attacks, or to recover from outages \nthat could be caused by a malware or ransomware \nattack\n• the continuing migration of client-facing services to \nthe cloud, and modernization of those services\n• strengthening network security and managing \noutbound connections to reduce the risk of data loss \n• identifying, assessing and mitigating insider threat \nactivities that could lead to the misuse of \nJPMorganChase’s systems or client and customer \ninformation, and\n• integrating acquired businesses where system \nintegration may be complex or may require \nextensive and lengthy remediation or enhancement \nof controls.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the \nsecurity of JPMorganChase’s systems or the systems \nof a vendor, governmental body or another market \nparticipant could cause serious negative \nconsequences, including:\n• significant disruption of JPMorganChase’s \noperations and those of its clients, customers and \ncounterparties, including losing access to \noperational systems\n• misappropriation of confidential information of \nJPMorganChase or that of its clients, customers, \ncounterparties, employees or regulators\n• disruption of or damage to JPMorganChase’s \nsystems and those of its clients, customers and \ncounterparties\n• the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully \nrecover and restore data that has been stolen, \nmanipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent \nsystems from processing fraudulent transactions\n• demands that JPMorganChase pay a ransom to a \nmalicious actor that has perpetrated a cybersecurity \nbreach\n• unintended violations by JPMorganChase of \napplicable privacy and other laws\n• financial loss to JPMorganChase or to its clients, \ncustomers, counterparties or employees\n• losses to JPMorganChase in excess of cyber \ninsurance policy coverage\n• loss of confidence in JPMorganChase’s \ncybersecurity and business resiliency measures\n• dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients, \ncustomers or counterparties\n• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory \nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack, the methods \nand tools used by various actors, and the steps that \nJPMorganChase may need to take to investigate the \nattack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a \nsignificant amount of time before such an investigation \ncan be completed. While such an investigation is \nongoing, JPMorganChase may not necessarily know \nthe full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, \nand that damage may continue to spread. These \nfactors may inhibit JPMorganChase’s ability to provide \nrapid, full and reliable information about the cyber \nattack to its clients, customers, counterparties and \nregulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may \nnot be clear how best to contain and remediate the \nharm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or \nactions could be repeated or compounded before they \nare discovered and remediated. Any or all of these \nfactors could further increase the costs and \nconsequences of a cyber attack.\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected if it fails \nto identify and address operational risks associated \nwith the introduction of or changes to products, \nservices and delivery platforms or the adoption of \nnew technologies.\nWhen JPMorganChase launches a new product or \nservice, introduces a new platform for the delivery or \n25\ndistribution of products or services (including mobile \nconnectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), \nacquires or invests in a business, makes changes to an \nexisting product, service or delivery platform, or \nadopts a new technology, it may not fully appreciate or \nidentify new operational risks that may arise from \nthose changes, including increased reliance on third \nparty providers, or may fail to implement adequate \ncontrols to mitigate the risks associated with those \nchanges. Any significant failure in this regard could \ndiminish JPMorganChase’s ability to operate one or \nmore of its businesses or result in:\n• potential liability to clients, counterparties and \ncustomers\n• higher compliance, operational or integration costs \n• higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, \npenalties and other sanctions\n• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation\n• impairment of JPMorganChase’s liquidity\n• regulatory intervention, or \n• weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially \nand adversely affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and \nresults of operations.\nJPMorganChase’s business and operations rely on \nits ability, and the ability of key external parties, to \nmaintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on \nthe competence, trustworthiness, health and safety \nof employees.\nJPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses \nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and \nservices that meet the expectations of its clients and \ncustomers, and to maintain an effective risk \nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its \nability to staff its operations appropriately and on the \ncompetence, trustworthiness, health and safety of its \nemployees. JPMorganChase's businesses and \noperations similarly rely on the workforces of third \nparties, including employees of vendors, custodians \nand financial markets infrastructures, and of \nbusinesses that it may seek to acquire. \nJPMorganChase’s businesses could be materially and \nadversely affected by:\n• the ineffective implementation of business decisions\n• any failure to institute controls that appropriately \naddress risks associated with business activities, or \nto appropriately train employees with respect to \nthose risks and controls\n• staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets\n• the possibility that significant portions of \nJPMorganChase’s workforce are unable to work \neffectively, including because of illness, quarantines, \nshelter-in-place arrangements, government actions \nor other restrictions in connection with health \nemergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, \nepidemics or pandemics, or due to extraordinary \nevents beyond JPMorganChase’s control such as \nnatural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of \nhostilities\n• a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, \nfraud or other unlawful conduct, or\n• other negative outcomes caused by human error or \nmisconduct by an employee of JPMorganChase or of \nanother party on which JPMorganChase’s \nbusinesses or operations rely.\nJPMorganChase’s operations could also be impaired if \nthe measures taken by it or by governmental \nauthorities to protect the health and safety of its \nemployees are ineffective, or if any external party on \nwhich JPMorganChase relies fails to take appropriate \nand effective actions to protect the health and safety \nof its employees.\nJPMorganChase faces substantial legal and \noperational risks in the processing and safeguarding \nof personal information.\nJPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are \nsubject to complex and evolving laws, rules and \nregulations, both within and outside the U.S., \ngoverning the privacy and protection of personal \ninformation of individuals. Governmental authorities \naround the world have adopted and are considering \nthe adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory \ninitiatives concerning privacy, data protection and \nsecurity. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to \nthese laws, rules and regulations could result in fines \nor orders requiring that JPMorganChase change its \ndata-related practices, which could have an adverse \neffect on JPMorganChase’s ability to provide products \nand otherwise harm its business operations.\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorganChase’s \ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal \ninformation to comply with all applicable laws, rules \nand regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including \nwhere the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, \ncan:\n• increase JPMorganChase’s compliance and \noperating costs\n• hinder the development of new products or services, \ncurtail the offering of existing products or services, \nor affect how products and services are offered to \nclients and customers\n• demand significant oversight by JPMorganChase’s \nmanagement, and \n• require JPMorganChase to structure its businesses, \noperations and systems in less efficient ways. \nNot all of JPMorganChase’s clients, customers, \nvendors, counterparties and other external parties \nmay have appropriate controls in place to protect the \nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of the \nPart I\n26\ninformation exchanged between them and \nJPMorganChase, particularly where information is \ntransmitted by electronic means. JPMorganChase \ncould be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, \npenalties or other sanctions if personal information of \nclients, customers, employees or others were to be \nmishandled or misused, such as situations where such \ninformation is:\n• erroneously provided to parties who are not \npermitted to have the information, or\n• intercepted or otherwise compromised by \nunauthorized third parties.\nThe increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence \ntechnologies poses a greater risk of identity fraud, as \nmalicious actors may exploit artificial intelligence to \ncreate convincing false identities or manipulate \nverification processes. This challenge necessitates \nongoing enhancements to client verification systems \nand security protocols to prevent unauthorized access \nand protect sensitive client information. Failure to \nmanage these risks or to implement effective \ncountermeasures could lead to unauthorized \ntransactions, financial losses, reputational damage and \nincreased regulatory scrutiny.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of \nJPMorganChase’s measures to safeguard personal \ninformation, or the perception that those measures are \ninadequate, could cause JPMorganChase to lose \nexisting or potential clients and customers or \nemployees, and thereby reduce JPMorganChase’s \nrevenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure \nby JPMorganChase to comply with applicable privacy \nor data protection laws, rules and regulations, or any \nfailure to appropriately calibrate, manage and monitor \naccess by employees or third parties to personal \ninformation, could subject JPMorganChase to \ninquiries, examinations and investigations that could \nresult in requirements to modify or cease certain \noperations or practices, significant liabilities or \nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of \nthese could damage JPMorganChase’s reputation and \notherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the \ninappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of \npersonal information have led to expanded \ngovernmental scrutiny of practices relating to the \nprocessing or safeguarding of personal information by \ncompanies in the U.S. and other countries. That \nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the \nfuture lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and \nregulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and \nstorage of personal information. These types of laws, \nrules and regulations can prohibit or significantly \nrestrict financial services firms such as \nJPMorganChase from transferring information across \nnational borders or sharing information among \naffiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby \nincrease compliance costs and operational risk, or \nrestrict JPMorganChase’s use of personal information \nwhen developing or offering products or services to \ncustomers. Some countries are considering or have \nadopted legislation implementing data protection \nrequirements or requiring local storage and \nprocessing of data which could increase the cost and \ncomplexity of JPMorganChase’s delivery of products \nand services. These restrictions could also inhibit \nJPMorganChase’s development or marketing of \ncertain products or services, or increase the costs of \noffering them to customers.\nJPMorganChase’s operations, results and reputation \ncould be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary \nevents beyond its control.\nJPMorganChase’s business and operational systems \ncould be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could \nbe harmed, by events or contributing factors that are \nwholly or partially beyond its control, including \nmaterial instances of:\n• cyber attacks\n• security breaches of its physical premises, including \nthreats to health and safety\n• power, telecommunications or internet outages, or \nshutdowns of mass transit\n• failure of, or loss of access to, technology or \noperational systems, including any resulting loss of \ncritical data\n• interruption of service from third-party service \nproviders \n• damage to or loss of property or assets of \nJPMorganChase or third parties, and any \nconsequent injuries, including in connection with any \nconstruction projects undertaken by \nJPMorganChase\n• effects of climate change\n• natural disasters or severe weather conditions\n• accidents such as explosions or structural failures\n• health emergencies, the spread of infectious \ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\n• events arising from local or larger-scale civil or \npolitical unrest, any outbreak or escalation of \nhostilities, or terrorist acts.\nJPMorganChase operates a Firmwide resiliency \nframework that is intended to enable it to prepare for \nand adapt to changing conditions and withstand and \nrecover from, and address any adverse effects on its \noperations caused by, disruptions that may impact \ncritical business functions and supporting assets, \nincluding its staff, technology, data and facilities and \nthose of third-party service providers. \nAlthough not every form of disruption can be \nanticipated or defended against, JPMorganChase \n27\nstrives for resiliency or recovery in a range of scenarios \nin the event of a disruption, including due to the \noccurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its \ncontrol. There can be no assurance that \nJPMorganChase’s Firmwide resiliency framework will \nfully mitigate all potential resiliency risks to \nJPMorganChase, its clients, and customers and third \nparties with which it does business, or that its \nresiliency framework will be adequate to address the \neffects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple or \nextended disruption events. In addition, \nJPMorganChase’s ability to respond effectively to a  \ndisruption event could be hampered to the extent that \nthe members of its workforce, physical assets,  \nsystems and other support infrastructure, or those of \nits third-party service providers, that are needed to \naddress the event are geographically dispersed, or \nconversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in \nwhich they are concentrated. Further, should \nextraordinary events or the factors that cause or \ncontribute to those events become more chronic, the \ndisruptive effects of those events on JPMorganChase’s \nbusiness and operations, and on its clients, customers, \ncounterparties and employees, could become more \nsignificant and long-lasting. \nAny significant failure or disruption of \nJPMorganChase’s operations or operational systems, \nor the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events \nthat are beyond its control, could:\n• hinder JPMorganChase’s ability to provide services \nto its clients and customers or to transact with its \ncounterparties\n• require it to expend significant resources to correct \nthe failure or disruption or to address the event\n• cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from \nloss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or \ninjuries\n• disrupt market infrastructure systems on which \nJPMorganChase’s businesses rely \n• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or \nother sanctions, and\n• harm its reputation.\nThe occurrence of one or more extraordinary events \ncould also negatively impact the financial condition or \ncreditworthiness of JPMorganChase’s clients and \ncustomers, and could lead to an increase in \ndelinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit \nlosses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce \nJPMorganChase’s earnings.\nData quality is essential to JPMorganChase’s \nbusiness and operations, and if JPMorganChase fails \nto maintain adequate data management processes, \nthis could adversely affect its ability to effectively \nmanage its businesses, comply with applicable laws, \nrules and regulations, or remain competitive. \nJPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and \ncomplete data to effectively operate its systems and \nprocesses, including:\n• assessing risk exposures and limits\n• monitoring and detecting fraudulent transactions \nand cyber threats\n• developing or maintaining models and other \nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, \nincluding those that use machine learning or artificial \nintelligence\n• implementing and maintaining compliance \nprograms, and\n• preparing financial statements, disclosures and \nregulatory reports, as well as internal reporting\nAny deficiencies in JPMorganChase’s data \nmanagement processes, including with respect to the \naccuracy or completeness of data, the timeliness of \ndata collection, the analysis or validation of data, or the \nsafeguarding of data could undermine the reliability \nand effectiveness of its operations, including:\n• risk management practices, including inaccurate or \nuntimely risk reporting \n• delivery of regulatory reporting or internal or \nexternal financial reporting\n• compliance practices, such as those relating to \ntransaction monitoring, customer screening, \nblocking and rejecting transactions, recordkeeping \nor reporting\n• business activities, such as those related to \nmanaging JPMorganChase's market-making \npositions and liquidity and capital levels, including \nreliance on timely data for informed decision-making\n• providing services to clients and customers, \nincluding transaction processing, lending services, \naccount management and customer support, or\n• fraud detection and prevention processes.\nAny or all of these factors could impair the ability of \nJPMorganChase to make sound business decisions, \ncause it to incur higher operational and compliance \ncosts, result in operational breakdowns or failure to \nmeet its regulatory requirements, negatively affect \nclients and customers, or lead to reputational harm.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the \noversight of vendors and other service providers can \nresult in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorganChase must comply with enhanced \nregulatory and other standards associated with doing \nPart I\n28\nbusiness with vendors and other service providers, \nincluding standards relating to the outsourcing of \nfunctions as well as the performance of significant \nbanking and other functions by subsidiaries. \nJPMorganChase incurs significant costs and expenses \nin connection with its initiatives to address the risks \nassociated with oversight of its internal and external \nservice providers. JPMorganChase’s failure to \nappropriately assess and manage these relationships, \nespecially those involving significant banking \nfunctions, shared services or other critical activities, \ncould materially adversely affect JPMorganChase. \nSpecifically, any such failure could result in:\n• potential harm to clients and customers, and any \nliability associated with that harm\n• regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n• lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost \nrevenues\n• increased operational costs, or\n• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nJPMorganChase’s risk management framework and \ncontrol environment will not be effective in \nidentifying and mitigating every risk to \nJPMorganChase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorganChase’s risk \nmanagement framework, governance structure, \npractices, models or reporting systems, or in its \ncontrol environment, could expose it to unexpected \nlosses, and its financial condition or results of \noperations could be materially and adversely affected. \nAny such inadequacy or lapse could:\n• hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to \nJPMorganChase’s senior management and Board of \nDirectors\n• lead to business decisions that have negative \noutcomes for JPMorganChase\n• require significant resources and time to remediate\n• lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and \nregulations\n• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny\n• expose JPMorganChase to litigation, regulatory \ninvestigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other \nsanctions\n• lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and \nany liability associated with that harm\n• harm its reputation, or \n• otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorganChase.\nMany of JPMorganChase’s risk management \nstrategies and techniques consider historical market \nbehavior and to some degree are based on \nmanagement’s subjective judgment or assumptions. \nFor example, many models used by JPMorganChase \nare based on assumptions regarding historical \ncorrelations among prices of various asset classes or \nother market indicators. In times of market stress, \nincluding difficult or less liquid market environments, \nor in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, \npreviously uncorrelated indicators may become \ncorrelated. Conversely, previously-correlated \nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times. \nSudden market movements and unanticipated market \nor economic events could, in some circumstances, \nlimit the effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s risk \nmanagement strategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorganChase could recognize unexpected losses, \nits capital levels could be reduced and it could face \ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations \nor judgments, including those used in its financial \nstatements, are inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorganChase has developed and uses a variety of \nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based \nestimations to measure, monitor and implement \ncontrols over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, \noperational and other risks. JPMorganChase also uses \ninternal models and estimations as a basis for its \nstress testing and in connection with the preparation \nof its financial statements under U.S. generally \naccepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). \nThese models and estimations are based on a variety \nof assumptions and historical trends, and are \nperiodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The \nmodels and estimations that JPMorganChase uses, \nincluding those that use machine learning or artificial \nintelligence, may not be effective in all cases to \nidentify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of \nfactors, such as:\n• reliance on historical trends that may not persist in \nthe future, including assumptions underlying the \nmodels and estimations such as correlations among \ncertain market indicators or asset prices\n• inherent limitations associated with forecasting \nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\n• historical trend information may be incomplete, or \nmay not be indicative of severely negative market \nconditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or \nlack of liquidity\n• sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of \ncertain loans and securities may make it more \ndifficult to value certain financial instruments\n• technology that is introduced to run models or \nestimations may not perform as expected, or may \nnot be well understood by the personnel using the \ntechnology\n• models and estimations may contain erroneous \ndata, valuations, formulas or algorithms\n• review processes may fail to detect flaws in models \nand estimations, and\n29\n• models may inadvertently incorporate biases \npresent in data used in the models.\nJPMorganChase may experience unexpected losses if \nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in \nconnection with its risk management activities or the \npreparation of its financial statements are inadequate \nor incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices \nare not available for certain financial instruments that \nrequire a determination of their fair value, \nJPMorganChase may make fair value determinations \nbased on internally developed models or other means \nwhich ultimately rely to some degree on management \nestimates and judgment. In addition, JPMorganChase \nmay experience increased uncertainty in its estimates \nif assets acquired differ from those used to develop \nthose models, which may lead to unexpected losses.\nSimilarly, JPMorganChase establishes an allowance for \nexpected credit losses related to its credit exposures \nwhich requires significant judgments, including \nforecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might \nimpair the ability of JPMorganChase’s clients and \ncustomers to repay their loans or other obligations. \nThese types of estimates and judgments may not \nprove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, \nincluding when the current and forecasted \nenvironments are significantly different from the \nhistorical environments upon which the models were \ndeveloped. The increased uncertainty may necessitate \na greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform \nany adjustments that JPMorganChase may make to \nmodel outputs than would otherwise be the case.\nSome of the models and other analytical and \njudgment-based estimations used by JPMorganChase \nin managing risks are subject to review by, and require \nthe approval of, JPMorganChase’s regulators. These \nreviews are required before JPMorganChase may use \nthose models and estimations for calculating market \nrisk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA \nunder Basel III. If JPMorganChase’s models or \nestimations are not approved by its regulators, it may \nbe subject to higher capital charges, which could \nadversely affect its financial results or limit the ability \nto expand its businesses. \nLapses, weaknesses or deficiencies in controls over \ndisclosure or financial reporting could materially \naffect JPMorganChase’s profitability or reputation.\nJPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are \nsubject to complex and evolving laws, rules and \nregulations, both within and outside the U.S., requiring \ncontinuous enhancements to various disclosures in its \nfinancial statements and regulatory reports.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorganChase’s \ndisclosure controls and procedures will be effective in \nevery circumstance, or that a material weakness or \nsignificant deficiency in internal control over financial \nreporting will not occur. Any such lapse, weakness or \ndeficiency could result in inaccurate financial reporting \nwhich, in turn, could:\n• materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s \nbusiness and results of operations or financial \ncondition\n• restrict its ability to access the capital markets \n• require it to expend significant resources to correct \nthe lapse, weakness or deficiency\n• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or \nother sanctions\n• harm its reputation, or \n• otherwise diminish investor confidence in \nJPMorganChase. \nStrategic\nJPMorganChase’s results or competitive standing \ncould suffer if its management fails to develop and \nexecute effective business strategies, and to \nanticipate changes affecting those strategies.\nThe development and execution of effective business \nstrategies by JPMorganChase’s management, along \nwith the ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in \nthe competitive environment, are critical to \nJPMorganChase's competitive standing and to \nachieving its strategic objectives. These strategies \nrelate to:\n• the products and services that JPMorganChase \noffers\n• the geographies in which it operates\n• the types of clients and customers that it serves\n• the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests\n• the counterparties with which it does business\n• the technologies that it adopts or in which it invests, \nwhich may include new and currently unproven \ntechnologies, and\n• the methods, distribution channels and third party \nservice providers by or through which it offers \nproducts and services. \nIf management makes choices about these strategies \nand goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on \nincomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do \nnot accurately assess the competitive landscape and \nindustry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory \nand market environments or the expectations of \nclients, customers, investors, employees and other \nstakeholders, then the franchise values and growth \nprospects of JPMorganChase’s businesses may suffer \nand its earnings could decline.\nJPMorganChase’s growth prospects also depend on \nmanagement’s ability to develop and execute effective \nbusiness plans to address these strategic priorities, \nboth in the near term and over longer time horizons. \nManagement’s effectiveness in this regard will affect \nPart I\n30\nJPMorganChase’s ability to develop and enhance its \nresources, control expenses and return capital to \nshareholders. Each of these objectives could be \nadversely affected by any failure on the part of \nmanagement to:\n• devise effective business plans and strategies\n• offer products and services that meet changing \nexpectations of clients and customers\n• allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term \nstability to enable JPMorganChase to build and \ninvest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly \nstressed environment\n• allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise \nmodeling or subjective judgments made in \nconnection with those allocations\n• appropriately assess and monitor principal \ninvestments made to enhance or accelerate \nJPMorganChase's business strategies \n• conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective \nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or effectively \nintegrate newly-acquired businesses\n• appropriately address concerns of clients, \ncustomers, investors, employees and other \nstakeholders, including with respect to climate and \nother ESG matters\n• react quickly to changes in market conditions or \nmarket structures, or\n• develop and enhance the operational, technology, \nrisk, financial and managerial resources and \ncapabilities necessary to grow and manage \nJPMorganChase’s businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorganChase may incur costs in \nconnection with disposing of excess properties, \npremises and facilities, and those costs could be \nmaterial to its results of operations.\nJPMorganChase faces significant and increasing \ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial services \nindustry.\nJPMorganChase operates in a highly competitive \nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to \nchanges  in financial regulation, technological \nadvances, increased public scrutiny and changes in \neconomic conditions. JPMorganChase expects that \ncompetition in the U.S. and global financial services \nindustry will continue to be intense. Competitors \ninclude:\n• other banks and financial institutions\n• trading, advisory and investment management firms\n• finance companies\n• technology companies, and\n• other non-bank firms that are engaged in providing \nsimilar as well as new products and services.\nJPMorganChase cannot provide assurance that the \nsignificant competition in the financial services \nindustry will not materially and adversely affect its \nfuture results of operations. For example, aggressive \nor less disciplined lending practices by non-bank \ncompetitors could lead to a loss of market share for \ntraditional banks, and in an economic downturn could \nresult in instability in the financial services industry \nand adversely impact other market participants, \nincluding JPMorganChase.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry \ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological \nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it \npossible for non-depository institutions to offer \nproducts and services that traditionally were banking \nproducts. These advances have also allowed financial \ninstitutions and other companies to provide electronic \nand internet-based financial solutions, including \nelectronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, \nlending and other extensions of credit to consumers, \npayments processing and online automated \nalgorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, \nboth financial institutions and their non-banking \ncompetitors face the risk that payments processing \nand other products and services, including deposits \nand other traditional banking products, could be \nsignificantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, \nsuch as cryptocurrencies and other applications using \nsecure distributed ledgers, that may not require \nintermediation. New technologies have required and \ncould require JPMorganChase to spend more to \nmodify or adapt its products to attract and retain \nclients and customers or to match products and \nservices offered by its competitors, including \ntechnology companies. In addition, new technologies \nmay be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated \nby third parties, in unexpected ways, which can \nincrease JPMorganChase’s costs for complying with \nlaws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of \nproducts and services through those technologies and \nreduce the income that JPMorganChase earns from \nproviding products and services through those \ntechnologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure \non the pricing for JPMorganChase’s products and \nservices or may cause JPMorganChase to lose market \nshare, particularly with respect to traditional banking \nproducts. This competition may be based on quality \nand variety of products and services offered, \ntransaction execution, innovation, reputation and \nprice. The failure of any of JPMorganChase’s \nbusinesses to meet the expectations of clients and \ncustomers, whether due to general market conditions, \nunder-performance, a decision not to offer a particular \nproduct or service, changes in client and customer \nexpectations or other factors, could affect \nJPMorganChase’s ability to attract or retain clients and \ncustomers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce \n31\nJPMorganChase’s revenues. Increased competition \nalso may require JPMorganChase to make additional \ncapital investments in its businesses, or to extend \nmore of its capital on behalf of its clients to remain \ncompetitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely affect \nJPMorganChase’s business and operations, both \ndirectly and as a result of impacts on its clients and \ncustomers.\nJPMorganChase operates in many regions, countries \nand communities around the world where its business, \nand the activities of its clients and customers, could be \nadversely affected by climate change. Climate change \ncould manifest as a financial risk to JPMorganChase \neither through changes in the physical climate or from \nthe process of transitioning to a lower-carbon \neconomy. Both physical risks and transition risks \nassociated with climate change could have negative \nimpacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness \nof JPMorganChase’s clients and customers, on \nJPMorganChase's exposure to affected companies \nand markets, and on the effectiveness of \nJPMorganChase’s existing business strategy with \nrespect to its operations, clients and customers.\nPhysical risks include the increased frequency or \nseverity of acute weather events, such as floods, \nwildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts in \nthe climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent \nchanges in precipitation levels, or increases in average \nambient temperatures. Potential adverse impacts of \nclimate-related physical risks to JPMorganChase, its \nclients or customers include:\n• declines in asset values, including due to the \ndestruction or degradation of property\n• reduced availability or increased cost of insurance \nfor clients of JPMorganChase\n• interruptions to business operations, including \nsupply chain disruption, and\n• population migration or unemployment in affected \nregions.\nTransition risks arise from the financial and economic \nconsequences of society’s shift towards a lower-\ncarbon economy, such as changes in public policy, \nadoption of new technologies or changes in consumer \npreferences towards low-carbon goods and services. \nThese risks could also be influenced by changes in the \nphysical climate. Potential adverse impacts of \ntransition risks to JPMorganChase, its clients or \ncustomers include:  \n• sudden devaluation of assets, including \nunanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)\n• increased operational and compliance costs driven \nby changes in climate policy  \n• increased energy costs driven by governmental \nactions and initiatives such as emission pricing and \naccelerated decarbonization policies\n• negative consequences to business models, and the \nneed to make changes in response to those \nconsequences, and\n• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation, including \ndue to any perception that its business practices are \ncontrary to public policy or the preferences of \ndifferent stakeholders. \nClimate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and \nconflicts in the manner in which climate policy and \nfinancial regulations are implemented in the many \nregions where JPMorganChase operates, including \ninitiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation \nwith extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal \nmodels and estimations used in climate risk \nassessments have an increased level of uncertainty \ndue to limited historical trend information and the \nabsence of standardized, reliable and comprehensive \ngreenhouse gas emissions data, which could lead to \ninaccurate disclosures or financial reporting. \nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorganChase employees can \nharm clients and customers, impact market \nintegrity, damage JPMorganChase’s reputation and \ntrigger litigation and regulatory action.\nJPMorganChase’s employees interact with clients, \ncustomers, counterparties and other market and \nindustry participants, and with each other, every \nday. All employees are expected to demonstrate \nvalues and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral \npart of JPMorganChase’s Code of Conduct and \nBusiness Principles. JPMorganChase endeavors to \nembed conduct risk management throughout an \nemployee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, \ntraining and development, and performance \nmanagement. Conduct risk management is also an \nintegral component of JPMorganChase’s promotion \nand compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and \npractices, certain employees have engaged in \nimproper or illegal conduct in the past. These \ninstances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and \nresolutions of governmental investigations or \nenforcement actions involving consent orders, \ndeferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution \nagreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. \nThere is no assurance that further inappropriate or \nunlawful actions by employees have not occurred or \nwill not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these \nresolutions (and associated consequences), or that \nany such actions will always be detected, deterred or \nprevented.\nJPMorganChase’s reputation could be harmed by, and \ncollateral consequences could result from, a failure by \nPart I\n32\none or more employees to conduct themselves in \naccordance with JPMorganChase’s expectations, \npolicies and practices, including by acting in ways that \nharm clients, customers, other market participants, \nemployees or others. Some examples of this include:\n• improperly selling and marketing JPMorganChase’s \nproducts or services\n• engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or \nunauthorized trading\n• engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in \nconnection with government relief programs\n• facilitating a transaction where a material objective \nis to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial \ndisclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny \nby governmental or regulatory authorities, or where \nthe proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect \nthe economic substance of the transaction\n• failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties \nowed to clients or customers\n• violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by \ncolluding with other market participants\n• using electronic communications channels that have \nnot been approved by JPMorganChase\n• engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment \nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or \nacting contrary to JPMorganChase’s goal of \nfostering an inclusive workplace\n• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate \nJPMorganChase’s risk appetite to business \nperformance goals or employee compensation \nobjectives, and\n• misappropriating property, confidential or \nproprietary information, or technology assets \nbelonging to JPMorganChase, its clients and \ncustomers or third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more \nemployees to conduct themselves in accordance with \nJPMorganChase’s expectations, policies or practices \ncould include litigation, or regulatory or other \ngovernmental investigations or enforcement actions. \nAny of these proceedings or actions could result in \njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other \nsanctions, or lead to:\n• financial losses\n• increased operational and compliance costs\n• greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\n• regulatory actions that require JPMorganChase to \nrestructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities\n• the need for significant oversight by \nJPMorganChase’s management\n• loss of clients or customers, and\n• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with respect \nto newly-acquired businesses if JPMorganChase fails \nto successfully integrate employees of those \nbusinesses or any of those employees do not conduct \nthemselves in accordance with JPMorganChase's \nexpectations, policies and practices.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorganChase’s reputation could harm \nits businesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorganChase is critical to its \nability to attract and retain clients, customers, \ninvestors and employees. Damage to \nJPMorganChase’s reputation can therefore cause \nsignificant harm to JPMorganChase’s business and \nprospects, and can arise from numerous sources, \nincluding:\n• employee misconduct, including discriminatory \nbehavior or harassment with respect to clients, \ncustomers or employees, or actions that are contrary \nto JPMorganChase’s goal of fostering an inclusive \nworkplace\n• security breaches, including as a result of cyber \nattacks\n• failure to safeguard client, customer or employee \ninformation\n• failure to manage risks associated with its client \nrelationships, or with transactions or business \nactivities in which JPMorganChase or its clients \nengage, including transactions or activities that may \nbe unpopular among one or more constituencies\n• rapid and broad dissemination of misinformation \nand disinformation across the media landscape, \nincluding social networking sites\n• incorrect, biased or misleading results or content \ngenerated by artificial intelligence, leading to \nharmful outcomes, including discrimination in \nlending practices against vulnerable populations, \nfraud, manipulation of customers, privacy breaches \nor intellectual property infringement\n• deficiencies or perceived failures in managing ESG-\nrelated initiatives, including modifying or failing to \nmeet publicly-announced targets\n• operational failures\n• litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other \nsanctions \n• actions taken in executing regulatory and \ngovernmental requirements during a global or \nregional health emergency, spread of infectious \ndisease, epidemic or pandemic\n• regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or \nresolutions of these matters, and \n• failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules \nor regulations by JPMorganChase or its clients, \n33\ncustomers, counterparties or other parties, including \nnewly-acquired businesses, companies in which \nJPMorganChase has made principal investments, \nparties to joint ventures with JPMorganChase, and \nvendors with which JPMorganChase does business.\nSocial and environmental activists have been targeting \nJPMorganChase and other financial services firms with \npublic criticism concerning their business practices, \nincluding business relationships with clients that are \nengaged in certain sensitive industries, such as \ncompanies:\n• whose products are or are perceived to be harmful \nto human health, or\n• whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to \nnegatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or \ncommunities. \nActivists have also taken actions intended to change \nor influence JPMorganChase’s business practices with \nrespect to ESG matters, including public protests at \nJPMorganChase’s headquarters and other properties, \nand submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a \nvote by JPMorganChase’s shareholders.\nIn addition, JPMorganChase has been and expects that \nit will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians \nand other members of the public concerning business \npractices or positions taken by JPMorganChase with \nrespect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, \nequity and inclusion initiatives) or regarding \ntransactions or other business or interactions between \nJPMorganChase and governmental or regulatory \nbodies. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's relationships \nor ability to transact with clients and customers, and \nwith governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions \nin which JPMorganChase does business, could be \nadversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing \nbusiness with companies in certain sensitive industries \nare perceived to harm those companies or to align with \nparticular political viewpoints. The foregoing types of \ncriticism can be more widespread during election \nyears in various jurisdictions, and could have the effect \nof focusing attention on a company such as \nJPMorganChase as part of a wider public debate on \npublic policy matters. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's \nparticipation in or association with certain \nenvironmental and social industry groups or initiatives \ncould be viewed by activists or governmental \nauthorities as boycotting or other discriminatory \nbusiness behavior.\nThese and other types of criticism and actions \ndirected at JPMorganChase could potentially \nengender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials and other \nstakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorganChase’s \nreputation and its business and results of operations \ncould be harmed by:\n• greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory \nbodies, or further criticism from politicians and other \nmembers of the public, including in the form of \ngovernmental or regulatory investigations or \nlitigation\n• unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media, \nincluding through social media campaigns\n• certain clients and customers ceasing doing \nbusiness with JPMorganChase, and encouraging \nothers to do so\n• impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to attract \nnew clients and customers, to expand its \nrelationships with existing clients and customers, or \nto hire or retain employees, or\n• certain investors opting to divest from investments \nin securities of JPMorganChase.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or \nindividuals in the industry can also affect \nJPMorganChase’s reputation. For example, the \nreputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged \nby concerns that:\n• consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial \ninstitution, or\n• a financial institution has acted inappropriately with \nrespect to the methods used to offer products to \ncustomers.\nIf JPMorganChase is perceived to have engaged in \nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its \nreputation among clients or customers, employees or \nother stakeholders.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of \ninterest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result \nin litigation and enforcement actions, as well as \ndamage JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nJPMorganChase’s ability to manage potential conflicts \nof interest is highly complex due to the broad range of \nits business activities which encompass a variety of \ntransactions, obligations and interests with and among \nJPMorganChase’s clients and customers. \nJPMorganChase can become subject to litigation, \nenforcement actions, and heightened regulatory \nscrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the \nfailure or perceived failure to:\n• adequately address or appropriately disclose \nconflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of \ninterest that may arise in connection with providing \nmultiple products and services in, or having one or \nmore investments related to, the same transaction\n• identify and address any conflict of interest that a \nthird party with which it is does business may have \nwith respect to a transaction involving \nJPMorganChase\n• deliver appropriate standards of service and quality\nPart I\n34\n• treat clients and customers fairly and with the \nappropriate standard of care\n• use client and customer data responsibly and in a \nmanner that meets legal requirements and \nregulatory expectations\n• provide fiduciary products or services in accordance \nwith the applicable legal and regulatory standards, \nor \n• handle or use confidential information of customers \nor clients appropriately and in compliance with \napplicable data protection and privacy laws, rules \nand regulations. \nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately address \nconflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could \nresult in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and \nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and \nheightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement \nactions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher \noperating costs and cause serious harm to \nJPMorganChase’s reputation.\nCountry\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between \ncountries or within a country or region could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the global economy and \non JPMorganChase’s businesses within the affected \nregion or globally. \nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, \nincluding armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, \ncould expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in \nother countries or escalating into full-scale war with \npotentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if \none or more of the combatants possess nuclear \nweapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the \nhostilities could result in:\n• worldwide economic disruption\n• heightened volatility in financial markets\n• severe declines in asset values, accompanied by \nwidespread sell-offs of investments\n• sudden increases in prices in the energy and \ncommodity markets or for certain safe haven \ncurrencies\n• substantial depreciation of local currencies, \npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and \ncounterparties in the affected region\n• disruption of global trade\n• diminished consumer, business and investor \nconfidence\n• refugee and humanitarian crises, and\n• new economic sanctions or other regulatory \nrequirements, including those that introduce \nexceptional compliance challenges for multinational \ncompanies such as JPMorganChase.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant \nnegative effects on JPMorganChase’s operations and \nearnings, both in the countries or regions directly \naffected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the \nU.S. were to become directly involved in such a \nconflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any \noperations that JPMorganChase may have in the \naffected countries or region, as well as in any nation \nthat is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. \nJPMorganChase could also experience more \nnumerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by \nor under the sponsorship of one or more of the \nadversaries in such a conflict.\nJPMorganChase’s business and operations in certain \ncountries can be adversely affected by local \neconomic, political, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorganChase \nconducts business have economies or markets that \nare less developed and more volatile or may have \npolitical, legal and regulatory regimes that are less \nestablished or predictable than other countries in \nwhich JPMorganChase operates. In addition, in some \njurisdictions in which JPMorganChase conducts \nbusiness, the local economy and business activities \nare subject to substantial government influence or \ncontrol. Some of these countries have in the past \nexperienced economic disruptions, including:\n• extreme currency fluctuations\n• high inflation\n• low or negative growth\n• defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt \nand\n• increased fraud or other misrepresentation of value.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes \nreacted to these developments by imposing restrictive \npolicies that adversely affect the local and regional \nbusiness environment, such as:\n• price, capital or exchange controls, including \nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility \nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\n• expropriation or nationalization of assets, including \nclient assets, or confiscation of property, including \nintellectual property, and\n• changes in laws, rules and regulations. \nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in \ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more \nvolatile than more-developed markets. These types of \ngovernment actions can negatively affect \nJPMorganChase’s operations in the relevant country, \neither directly or by suppressing the business \nactivities of local clients or multi-national clients that \nconduct business in the jurisdiction. \nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as \nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to \n35\nunfavorable social developments arising from poor \neconomic conditions or governmental actions, \nincluding: \n• widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general \nstrikes \n• crime and corruption\n• security and personal safety issues\n• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other \ngeopolitical instabilities\n• overthrow of incumbent governments\n• terrorist attacks, and \n• other forms of internal discord. \nThese economic, political, regulatory and social \ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in the \nfuture could lead to, conditions that can adversely \naffect JPMorganChase’s operations in those countries \nand impair the revenues, growth and profitability of \nthose operations. In addition, any of these events or \ncircumstances in one country can affect \nJPMorganChase’s operations and investments in \nanother country or countries, including in the U.S.\nPeople\nJPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain \nqualified employees is critical to its success.\nJPMorganChase’s employees are its most important \nresource, and in many areas of the financial services \nindustry, competition for qualified personnel is \nintense. JPMorganChase endeavors to attract talented  \nnew employees from a variety of backgrounds and \nretain, develop and motivate its existing employees. \nJPMorganChase's efforts to hire and retain talented  \nemployees could be hindered by factors such as:\n• the emerging need for more-skilled workers in an \nevolving labor and workplace environment, \nincluding due to changes in technology\n• targeted recruitment of JPMorganChase employees \nby competitors, and\n• modifications to or discontinuation of \nJPMorganChase's hybrid work models.\nJPMorganChase's performance and competitive \nposition could be materially and adversely affected if it \nis unable to attract or retain qualified employees for its \nworkforce or to devise and execute effective \nsuccession planning for key leadership roles, such as \nthe Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating \nCommittee and other senior leaders.\nIn addition, advances in technology, such as \nautomation and artificial intelligence, may lead to \nworkforce displacement. This could require \nJPMorganChase to invest in additional employee \ntraining, manage impacts on morale and retention, and \ncompete for employment candidates who possess \nmore advanced technological skills, all of which could \nhave a negative impact on JPMorganChase's business \nand operations. \nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel \npolicies could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s \nbusinesses and operations.\nJPMorganChase relies on the skills, knowledge and \nexpertise of employees located throughout the world. \nChanges in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. \nand other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise \nmake it more difficult for employees or their family \nmembers to work in, or travel to or transfer between, \njurisdictions in which JPMorganChase has operations \nor conducts its business could inhibit \nJPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified \nemployees, and thereby dilute the quality of its \nworkforce, or could prompt JPMorganChase to make \nstructural changes to its worldwide or regional \noperating models that cause its operations to be less \nefficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorganChase faces significant legal risks from \nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and \ngovernment investigations.\nJPMorganChase is named as a defendant or is \notherwise involved in many legal proceedings, \nincluding class actions, derivative actions and other \nlitigation or disputes with third parties, as well as \ncriminal proceedings. Actions currently pending \nagainst JPMorganChase may result in judgments, \nsettlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions \nadverse to JPMorganChase. Any of these matters \ncould materially and adversely affect \nJPMorganChase’s business, financial condition or \nresults of operations, or cause serious reputational \nharm. As a participant in the financial services \nindustry, it is likely that JPMorganChase will continue \nto experience a high level of litigation and regulatory \nand government investigations related to its \nbusinesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct \nexaminations of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries \nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and \nJPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are \nsubject to heightened regulatory oversight. This \nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such \nan investigation or examination, may lead to additional \nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions. \nThere is no assurance that those actions will not result \nin resolutions or other enforcement actions against \nJPMorganChase. Furthermore, a single event involving \na potential violation of law or regulation may give rise \nto numerous and overlapping investigations and \nproceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local \nagencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, \nregulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. \njurisdictions.\nPart I\n36\nIn addition, if another financial institution violates a law \nor regulation relating to a particular business activity \nor practice, this will often give rise to an investigation \nby regulators and other governmental agencies of the \nsame or similar activity or practice by JPMorganChase. \nJPMorganChase could become subject to a significant \nregulatory investigation and be unable to disclose \nspecific information concerning that investigation to \nthe public if such a disclosure would violate \nJPMorganChase’s obligations under applicable rules \nand regulations to maintain the confidentiality of \nconfidential supervisory information, even if the \nresolution of that investigation could have a material \nadverse effect on JPMorganChase’s business, \noperations, results or financial condition.\nRegulatory investigations, examinations or other \ninitiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental \nauthorities may subject JPMorganChase to judgments, \nsettlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and \nmay require JPMorganChase to restructure its \noperations and activities or to cease offering certain \nproducts or services. All of these potential outcomes \ncould harm JPMorganChase’s reputation or lead to \nhigher operational costs, thereby reducing \nJPMorganChase’s profitability, or result in collateral \nconsequences. In addition, the extent of \nJPMorganChase’s exposure to legal and regulatory \nmatters can be unpredictable and could, in some \ncases, exceed the amount of reserves that \nJPMorganChase has established for those matters.\n37\nItem 1B.

The Firm assesses the performance \nof its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.\nThe increase in CIB was partially offset by a net \ndecrease in Corporate, reflecting lower revenue in \nTreasury and CIO, and gains compared with a net loss \non certain legacy private equity investments in the \nprior year.\nRefer to CIB segment and Corporate results on pages \n77–83 and pages 88–90, respectively, and Note 6 for \nadditional information.\nLending- and deposit-related fees increased, \nreflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees, including \ncash management fees in Payments, on higher \nvolume; and higher lending-related fees, including loan \ncommitment fees. These factors were largely offset by \na decline in the amortization of the fair value discount \non certain acquired lending-related commitments \nassociated with First Republic, primarily in AWM, as \ncertain of the commitments have expired. \nRefer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 77–\n83 and pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for \nadditional information.\nAsset management fees increased, reflecting, in \nAWM and CCB, higher average market levels and net \ninflows, as well as higher performance fees in AWM; \nand in CCB, the timing impact of First Republic.

Refer to \nCorporate results on pages 88–90 and Note 10 for \nadditional information.\nMortgage fees and related income increased in Home \nLending, reflecting higher production revenue, which \nincluded the timing impact of First Republic.

Refer to CCB segment \nresults on pages 73–76 and Note 6 for additional \ninformation.\nOther income increased, reflecting: \n• in Corporate: \n– the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares \nrecorded in the second quarter of 2024,\npartially offset by\n– the absence of the prior-year $2.8 billion \nestimated bargain purchase gain associated with \nthe First Republic acquisition, and \n• in CIB:\n– the impact of the adoption of updates to the \nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit \nStructures guidance effective January 1, 2024, \nresulting in the amortization of certain of the \nFirm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments \npreviously recognized in other income which is \nnow recognized in income tax expense.\nBoth periods included impairment losses related to \ncertain equity investments. \nThe prior year included a gain of $339 million on the \noriginal minority interest in China International Fund \nManagement (\"CIFM\"), partially offset by net \ninvestment valuation losses, both in AWM.\nRefer to AWM segment results on pages 84–87 for \nadditional information on CIFM; Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 \nfor additional information on the adoption of updates \nto the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit \nStructures guidance; Notes 2 and 6 for additional \ninformation on Visa shares; and Notes 6 and 34 for \nadditional information on the First Republic \nacquisition.\nNet interest income increased driven by the impact of \nbalance sheet actions, primarily reinvestments in the \ninvestment securities portfolio, higher revolving \nbalances in Card Services, the timing impact of First \nRepublic, higher wholesale deposit balances and \nhigher Markets net interest income. These factors \nwere largely offset by deposit margin compression \nacross the lines of business and lower average deposit \nbalances in CCB.\nThe Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5 \ntrillion, up $212 billion, and the yield was 5.50%, up 36 \nbps.

That \npresentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, \nprovides the reader with an understanding of the \nFirm’s results that can be tracked consistently from \nyear-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s \nperformance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements \nof other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a \nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, \nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; \nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP \nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results \nof the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s \ndefinition of managed basis starts, in each case, with \nthe reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain \nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the \nFirm as a whole, and for each of the reportable \nbusiness segments and Corporate, on an FTE basis. \nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive \ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in \nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable \ninvestments and securities. These financial measures \nallow management to assess the comparability of \nrevenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable \nand tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income \ntax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded \nwithin income tax expense. These adjustments have \nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a \nwhole or by each of the lines of business and \nCorporate.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial \nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment levels \nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures \nprovide information to investors about the underlying \noperational performance and trends of the Firm or of \nthe particular business segment, as the case may be, \nand therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the \nbusiness segment with the performance of its relevant \ncompetitors. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate \nResults on pages 70–90 for additional information on \nthese non-GAAP measures.

Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable \nbusiness segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business \nsegments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the \nreorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & \nInvestment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. \nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer \nserved, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, \nwhose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a \nmanaged basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on \npages 67–69 for a definition of managed basis.\nThe following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are \nintended to present each segment as if it were a stand-\nalone business. The management reporting process \nthat derives business segment results includes the \nallocation of certain income and expense items. The \nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions, \nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for \nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements \nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also \nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on \nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide \nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the Firm \nand its investors and analysts in assessing \nperformance.\nRevenue sharing \nWhen business segments or businesses within each \nsegment join efforts to sell products and services to \nthe Firm’s clients and customers, the participating \nbusinesses may agree to share revenue from those \ntransactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the \nsegment responsible for the related product or \nservice, with allocations to the other segments or \nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment \nand business results reflect these revenue-sharing \nagreements.\n70\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nExpense allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by \nCorporate support units, or another business segment, \nthe costs of those services are allocated to the \nrespective business segments. The expense is \ngenerally allocated based on the actual cost and use of \nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and \ninvestments related to Corporate that are not currently \nutilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business \nsegments and are retained in Corporate. Expense \nretained in Corporate generally includes costs that \nwould not be incurred if the segments were stand-\nalone businesses, and other items not solely aligned \nwith a particular reportable business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which \nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the \nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary \ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the \ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets \nand liabilities and off-balance sheet products. \nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions \nutilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect \neconomic conditions and other factors, which may \nimpact the allocation of net interest income to the \nsegments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the \nFirm updated its FTP with respect to consumer \ndeposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding \nbenefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that \nis fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s \nnet interest income.\nAs a result of higher average interest rates, the cost of \nfunds for assets and the FTP benefit earned for \nliabilities have generally increased in the current year, \nimpacting the net interest income of the business \nsegments. During the period ended December 31, \n2024, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds for \nloans and Markets activities. In addition, rates paid to \ndeposit holders increased more than the FTP benefit \nincrease during the year, resulting in deposit margin \ncompression.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs \nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain \nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages \nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign \nexchange rate movements related to the transferred \nrisk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on \npage 149 for additional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the \ncredit spread component of outstanding unsecured \nlong-term debt and preferred stock dividends is \nallocated to the reportable business segments, while \nthe balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The \nmethodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-\nterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the \nbusiness segments is aligned with the relevant \nregulatory capital requirements and funding needs of \nthe LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of \nunsecured long-term debt is included in a business \nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is \nreduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a \nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common \nequity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages \n97–107 for additional information.\nCapital allocation \nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and \nCorporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current \nequity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III \nStandardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the \nglobal systemically important banks (“GSIB”) \nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well \nas a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress \nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions, \njudgments and methodologies used to allocate capital \nare reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to \nthe LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of \nbusiness and Corporate equity on page 104 for \nadditional information on capital allocation. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n71\nSegment & Corporate Results – Managed Basis\nThe following tables summarize the Firm’s results by business segments and Corporate for the periods indicated.\nYear ended December 31,\nConsumer & Community Banking\nCommercial & Investment Bank\nAsset & Wealth Management\n(in millions, except ratios)"

For example, securities that generate net \ninterest income may be risk-managed by derivatives \nthat are reflected at fair value in principal transactions \nrevenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the \ncomposition of these income statement line items. \nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial \ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise \nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal \ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized \nupon executing new transactions with market \nparticipants, as well as “inventory-related revenue,” \nwhich is revenue recognized from gains and losses on \nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has \nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client \ndemand, and changes in the fair value of instruments \nused by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure \narising from such inventory. Principal transactions \nrevenue recognized upon executing new transactions \nwith market participants is affected by many factors \nincluding the level of client activity, the bid-offer \nspread (which is the difference between the price at \nwhich a market participant is willing and able to sell an \ninstrument to the Firm and the price at which another \nmarket participant is willing and able to buy it from the \nFirm, and vice versa), market liquidity and \nvolatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive \nto the same factors that drive inventory-related \nrevenue, which include general market conditions, \nsuch as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit \nspreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as \nother macroeconomic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n81\nFor the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized \nupon executing new transactions.\n2024\n2023\n2022\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions, except where otherwise \nnoted)\nFixed \nIncome \nMarkets\nEquity \nMarkets\nTotal \nMarkets\nFixed \nIncome \nMarkets(c)\nEquity \nMarkets(c)\nTotal \nMarkets\nFixed \nIncome \nMarkets(c)\nEquity \nMarkets(c)\nTotal \nMarkets\nPrincipal transactions\n$ 10,603 $ 13,526 $ 24,129 \n$ \n13,198 $ 10,380 $ 23,578 \n$ 12,244 $ \n8,284 $ 20,528 \nLending- and deposit-related fees"

A 5-star rating is the best rating and \nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star \nrating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. \nA 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked \nfunds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-\nwide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and \nrepresents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An \noverall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of \nthe performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- \nyear (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-\ndomiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the \nindividual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based \non three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer \nthan three years of history are not rated and hence excluded \nfrom these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories \nand the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced \nfrom the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the \nfund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. \ndollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the \nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary \nshare class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, \nexcept for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund \nlevel. The performance data may have been different if all share \nclasses had been included. Past performance is not indicative of \nfuture results.\n• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under \nmanagement in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, \nthree and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer \ncategories and the asset values used to derive these rankings \nare sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings \nare based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where \napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values \ninto U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund \nperformance and associated peer rankings at the share class \nlevel for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to \nrepresent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong \nKong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The \nperformance data may have been different if all share classes \nhad been included. Past performance is not indicative of future \nresults.\n“Primary share class” means the C share class for European \nfunds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan \nfunds.

When the Firm extends a consumer or \nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their \ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or \noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on \nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to \nmanage its business, and the associated risks, in a \nmanner that balances serving the interests of its \nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the \nsafety and soundness of the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management \nrequires, among other things:  \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification \nand escalation of risks by all individuals within the \nFirm;  \n• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data \nand management within each of the LOBs and \nCorporate; and \n• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced \ncompensation framework with strong internal \ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board \nof Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and \ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s \nperformance evaluation and incentive compensation \nprocesses. \nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves \nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks and \nimpacts of risks. \nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. \nDrivers of risks include the economic environment, \nregulatory or government policy, competitor or market \nevolution, business decisions, process or judgment \nerror, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets \nand natural disasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest \nthemselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized \nin the following four risk types: \n•\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, \nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly-\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate \nresponse to changes in the operating environment. \n• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with \nthe default or change in credit profile of a client, \ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a \nreduction in expected returns on investments, \nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk \nand investment portfolio risk. \n• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of \nchanges in market factors, such as interest and \nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity \nprices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the \nvalue of assets and liabilities held for both the short \nand long term. \n• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome \nresulting from inadequate or failed internal \nprocesses or systems; human factors; or external \nevents impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. \nOperational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, \nconduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both \nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many \nconsequences when risks manifest themselves, \nincluding quantitative impacts such as a reduction in \nearnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or \npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the \nFirm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and \nregulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on \na Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk \nManagement (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of \nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief \nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval \nby the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the \n“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer \n(“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk \ngovernance framework of the Firm. The framework is \nsubject to approval by the Board Risk Committee \nthrough its review and approval of the Risk \nGovernance and Oversight Policy.\nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to \nthe Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk \nOfficers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and \nthe Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in \nturn, establish Risk Management and Compliance \norganizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance \npolicies and standards, and define and oversee the \nimplementation of the Firm’s risk governance \nframework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in \ntheir LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks \nthat span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as \nfunctions and regions. Each area of the Firm that gives \nrise to risk is expected to operate within the \nparameters identified by the IRM function, and within \nthe risk and control standards established by its own \nmanagement. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n91\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: \nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury \nand CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, \nincluding their aligned Operations, Technology and \nControl Management. The first line of defense owns \nthe risks, and identification of risks, associated with \ntheir respective activities and the design and \nexecution of controls to manage those risks. \nResponsibilities also include adherence to applicable \nlaws, rules and regulations and implementation of the \nrisk governance framework established by IRM, which \nmay include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and \ncontrols. \nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which is \nseparate from the first line of defense and is \nresponsible for independently measuring risk, as well \nas assessing and challenging the risk management \nactivities of the first line of defense. IRM is also \nresponsible for the identification of risks within its \norganization, its own adherence to applicable laws, \nrules and regulations and for the development and \nimplementation of policies and standards with respect \nto its own processes. \nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an \nindependent function that provides objective \nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of \nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk \nmanagement. The Internal Audit function is led by the \nGeneral Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee \nand administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute to \nthe Firmwide control environment but are not \nconsidered part of a particular line of defense, \nincluding Corporate Finance, Human Resources and \nLegal. These other functions are responsible for the \nidentification of risks within their respective \norganizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and \nregulations and implementation of the risk governance \nframework established by IRM.\nRisk identification and ownership\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the \nidentification of risks within their respective \norganizations, as well as the design and execution of \ncontrols, including IRM-specified controls, to manage \nthose risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk \nidentification framework designed to facilitate the \nresponsibility of each LOB and Corporate to identify \nmaterial risks inherent to the Firm’s businesses and \noperational activities, catalog them in a central \nrepository and review material risks on a regular basis. \nThe IRM function reviews and challenges the risks \nidentified by each LOB and Corporate, maintains the \ncentral repository and provides the consolidated \nFirmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee \n(“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. \nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by Risk \nAppetite frameworks for quantitative and qualitative \nrisks. The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and \napproved by senior management (including the CEO \nand CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. \nQuantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to \nmonitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk \nconsistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite \nresults are reported to the Board Risk Committee.  \nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n92\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides \nchannels for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC and the Board of Directors, as \nappropriate. \nThe chart below illustrates the principal standing committees of the Board of Directors and key senior \nmanagement-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other \ncommittees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart \nbelow or described in this Form 10-K.\nThe Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the \nFirm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), \nGeneral Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior \nexecutives, is accountable to and may refer matters to \nthe Firm’s Board of Directors.

IRM engages regularly in strategic business \ndiscussions and decision-making, including \nparticipation in relevant business reviews and senior \nmanagement meetings, risk and control committees \nand other relevant governance forums, and review of \nacquisitions and new business initiatives. The Board of \nDirectors oversees management’s strategic decisions, \nand the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the \nFirm’s risk governance framework.\nIn the process of developing business plans and \nstrategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior \nmanagement identify the associated risks that are \nincorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification \nframework and their impact on risk appetite. \nIn addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of \nthe LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess \ntheir impact on the risk profile of the Firm. \nThe Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes \nthe development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other \nstrategic initiatives, is one component of managing the \nFirm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the \nFirm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and \nincludes components such as budget, risk appetite, \ncapital, earnings and asset-liability management \nobjectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business Principles, \nthe Operating Committee and senior management \nteams in each LOB and Corporate review and update \nthe strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the \nstrategic framework and performance of strategic  \ninitiatives, assessing the operating environment, \nrefining existing strategies and developing new \nstrategies.\nThe Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s \nassessment, are provided to the Board as part of its \nreview and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and \nthe plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.  \nThe Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on \nrisk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust \nliquidity, is also a component in the management of \nstrategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on \npages 97–107 for further information on capital risk. \nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 \nfor further information on liquidity risk. Refer to \nReputation Risk Management on page 116 for further \ninformation on reputation risk.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n96\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT \nCapital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient \nlevel or composition of capital to support the Firm’s \nbusiness activities and associated risks during normal \neconomic environments and under stressed \nconditions.\nA strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s \nbusiness strategy and competitive position. \nMaintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through \neconomic volatility is a strategic imperative of the \nFirm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating \nCommittee. The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet” \nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong \ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk \nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-\nterm stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in \nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly \nstressed environments. Senior management considers \nthe implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making \nsignificant decisions that could impact future business \nactivities. In addition to considering the Firm’s \nearnings outlook, senior management evaluates all \nsources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the \nFirm’s capital strength.\nCapital risk management\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function \nwhose primary objective is to provide independent \noversight of capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:\n• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk \nmetrics;\n• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk \nlimits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;\n• Developing processes to classify, monitor and report \ncapital limit breaches; \n• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital \nmanagement activities, including changes made to \nthe Contingency Capital Plan described below; and\n• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory \ncapital framework intended to ensure compliance \nwith applicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital \nmanagement.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital \nmanagement are to:\n• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to \nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through \nnormal economic cycles and in stressed \nenvironments;\n• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future \ninvestment opportunities;\n• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a \nsource of strength to its subsidiaries;\n• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum \nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its principal \ninsured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all times under \napplicable regulatory capital requirements;\n• Meet capital distribution objectives; and\n• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate \nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with \nthe Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through: \n• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements \nand maintaining a strong capital governance \nframework. The internal minimum capital levels \nconsider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements \nas well as an internal assessment of capital \nadequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress \nevents;\n• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of \npotential events; and\n• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and \nfollowing prescribed escalation protocols, both at \nthe Firm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s \ncapital management include the Capital Governance \nCommittee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional \nALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) \nRisk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee \nperiodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. \nRefer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 91–95 \nfor additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and \nother risk-related committees.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review \nThe Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank \nHolding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually \na capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by \nthe Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) \nand other stress testing processes to assess whether \nlarge BHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital \nduring periods of economic and financial stress, and \nhave robust, forward-looking capital assessment and \nplanning processes in place that address each BHC’s \nunique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain \nstress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve \nevaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal \ncapital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as \nwell as its plans to make capital distributions, such as \ndividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n97\nReserve uses results under the severely adverse \nscenario from its supervisory stress test to determine \neach firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement \nfor the coming year. \nThe Firm's current SCB requirement is 3.3% and will \nremain in effect until September 30, 2025. The Firm’s \nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including \nregulatory buffers, was 12.3% as of December 31, 2024.\nRefer to Capital actions on page 105 for information on \nactions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors. \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process \nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs \nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of \nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and \nuses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory \nexpectations for capital planning and capital \nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing \nprotocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit \nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving \nthe capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of \nalternative economic and business scenarios on the \nFirm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and \nthe parameters underlying those scenarios, are \ndefined centrally and applied uniformly across the \nbusinesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of \nmacroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of \nbusiness results; global market shocks, which \ngenerate short-term but severe trading losses; and \nidiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios \nare intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities \nand idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to \nCCAR and other periodic stress testing, management \nalso considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity \nanalyses, as necessary. \nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the \ncapital management framework for the Firm and \nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach \ntowards capital management in normal economic \nconditions and in stressed environments. The \nContingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm \ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets \nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing \nappropriateness of planned capital distributions, and \nsets out the capital contingency actions that are \nexpected to be taken or considered at various levels of \ncapital depletion during a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, \nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a \nconsolidated financial holding company. The Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes \nsimilar minimum capital requirements and standards \nfor the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally \nfollow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as \namended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum \ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards \nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and \nbanks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, \nN.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that \nmust be held by BHCs and banks is determined by \ncalculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets \nand off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according \nto risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two \ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for \ncalculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III \nStandardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III \nAdvanced”). \nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital \nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of \nthe Standardized or Advanced approaches compared \nto their respective regulatory capital ratio \nrequirements.\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital \nrequirements for calculating credit risk RWA and \nmarket risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, \noperational risk RWA. Key differences in the \ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the \nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for \nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-\nsensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of \ninternal credit models and parameters, whereas for \nBasel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally \nbased on supervisory risk-weightings which vary \nprimarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market \nrisk RWA is generally calculated consistently between \nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In \naddition to the RWA calculated under these \napproaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts \nto incorporate management judgment and feedback \nfrom its regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Basel III \nStandardized ratios risk-based ratios were more \nbinding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. \nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced \nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm, \ncalculate their SLRs. \nRefer to page 104 for additional information on SLR.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n98\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nKey Regulatory Developments \nU.S. Basel III Finalization\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the \nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based \ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: \nAmendments applicable to large banking \norganizations and to banking organizations with \nsignificant trading activity\", which is referred to in this \nForm 10-K as the \"U.S. Basel III proposal\". Under this \nproposal, changes to the framework would include \nreplacement of the Advanced approach with an \nexpanded risk-based approach for the calculation of \nRWA. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement \nwould be applicable to both the expanded risk-based \napproach and the Standardized approach.\nGSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD \nRequirements\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a proposal \nto amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Under \nthe proposal, the annual GSIB surcharge would be \nbased on an average of the quarterly surcharge \ncalculations throughout the calendar year, with daily \naveraging required for certain measures. The proposal \nwould also reduce surcharge increments from 50 bps \nto 10 bps and includes other technical amendments to \nthe “Method 2” calculation. The proposed changes \nwould revise risk-based capital requirements for the \nFirm and other U.S. GSIBs. Refer to Risk-based Capital \nRegulatory Requirements on page 100 for further \ninformation on the GSIB surcharge. \nAdditionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the \nFDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the \neligible long-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean \nholding company requirements under the existing \ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to \nnon-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total \nconsolidated assets. The proposal would also reduce \nthe amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less \nthan two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC \nrequirement and expand the existing capital deduction \nframework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD \nissued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD \nrequirements. \nFinalization of the above proposals, including the \nrequired implementation dates, is uncertain. The Firm \ncontinues to monitor developments and potential \nimpacts.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n99\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements \nThe following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in \neffect.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to have a \nminimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted \nassets.\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are \nrequired to hold additional levels of capital to serve as \na “capital conservation buffer”. The capital \nconservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a \ndiscretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed \ncapital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced \nregulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable \nSCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized \nregulatory capital requirements. \nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is \nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual \nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based \non data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject \nto the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB \nsurcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s \nassessment methodology, and is calculated across \nfive criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, \ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. \n“Method 2” modifies the Method 1 requirements to \ninclude a measure of short-term wholesale funding in \nplace of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score \n“multiplication factor”. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB \nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2024 and \n2023. For 2025, the Firm’s effective regulatory \nminimum GSIB surcharge calculated under both \nMethod 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.5% \nand 4.5%, respectively.\n2024\n2023\nMethod 1\n 2.5 %\n 2.5 %\nMethod 2\n 4.5 %\n 4.0 %\nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a \nframework for setting a discretionary countercyclical \ncapital buffer taking into account the macro financial \nenvironment in which large, internationally active \nbanks function. As of December 31, 2024, the U.S. \ncountercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The \nFederal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at \nleast annually. The buffer can be increased if the \nFederal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC determine that \nsystemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can \nbe calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject \nto a 12-month implementation period. \nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in \nexcess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum \nplus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the \nGSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will \nresult in limitations to the amount of capital that the \nFirm may distribute, such as through dividends and \ncommon share repurchases, as well as on \ndiscretionary bonus payments for certain executive \nofficers.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n100\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\nThe Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. \nGSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to \nmaintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible \nLTD. Refer to TLAC on page 106 for additional \ninformation.\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nSupplementary leverage ratio\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III \nAdvanced approach are currently required to have a \nminimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, \nincluding the Firm, are also required to hold an \nadditional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as \nTier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total \nleverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is \ncalculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-\nbalance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be \ndeducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory \ncapital rules. Refer to SLR on page 104 for additional \ninformation.\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the \nregulatory requirement will result in limitations on the \namount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as \nthrough dividends and common share repurchases, as \nwell as on discretionary bonus payments for certain \nexecutive officers.\nOther regulatory capital\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of \nBasel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., must also maintain \nminimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be \n“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the \nFederal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action \nrequirements of the FDIC Improvement Act, \nrespectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional \ninformation. \nAdditional information regarding the Firm’s capital \nratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital \nstandards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in \nNote 27.

Refer to Firmwide Risk \nManagement on pages 91–95 for further discussion of \nALCO and other risk-related committees. \nInternal stress testing\nThe Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to \nmonitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material \nlegal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, \nincluding scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s \nresolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests \nare produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests \nare performed in response to specific market events or \nconcerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the \nFirm’s contractual financial obligations are met and \ntake into consideration: \n• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured \nfunding markets; \n• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash \noutflows;\n• Credit rating downgrades; \n• Collateral haircuts; and \n• Potential impediments to the availability and \ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and \nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or \nother restrictions. \nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time \nhorizons and currency dimensions and contemplate \nboth market and idiosyncratic stresses. \nResults of stress tests are considered in the \nformulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment \nof its liquidity position.

The Firm \nmanages liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and \noperating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply \nwith liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity \nrequirements, and to manage through periods of \nstress when access to normal funding sources may be \ndisrupted.\nContingency funding plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out \nthe strategies for addressing and managing liquidity \nresource needs during a liquidity stress event and \nincorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk \nappetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the \nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources \navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of \nstress. \nLCR and HQLA\nThe LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA \nthat is sufficient to meet their respective estimated \ntotal net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for \npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of \nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational \nconsiderations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA \nprimarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid \nsecurities as defined in the LCR rule.\nUnder the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held \nby JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its \nstand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that \nis not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be \nexcluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.\nEstimated net cash outflows are based on \nstandardized stress outflow and inflow rates \nprescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the \nbalances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and \nobligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. \nThe following table summarizes the Firm and \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the \nthree months ended December 31, 2024, September \n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on the Firm’s \ninterpretation of the LCR framework.\nThree months ended\nAverage amount\n(in millions)\nDecember \n31, 2024\nSeptember \n30, 2024\nDecember \n31, 2023\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)\n$ 396,123 \n$ 412,389 \n$ 485,263 \nEligible securities(b)(c)\n 464,877"

This includes excess eligible HQLA \nsecurities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not \ntransferable to non-bank affiliates.

The \ndecrease compared to December 31, 2023, was driven \nby reductions in unencumbered AFS securities in \nTreasury and CIO, excess eligible HQLA securities at \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB \ntrading assets.\nThe Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available \ncash and securities as of both December 31, 2024 and \n2023. For each respective period, the amount was \ncomprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding \nthe impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately \n$834 billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered \nmarketable securities with a fair value of \napproximately $594 billion and $649 billion.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the \nFederal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount \nwindow at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of \ncollateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of \napproximately $413 billion and $340 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This \nborrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and \nsecurities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other \nunencumbered securities that are currently pledged at \nthe Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other \ncentral banks. Available borrowing capacity increased \nfrom December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher \namount of commercial loans and credit card \nreceivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. \nAlthough available, the Firm does not view this \nborrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks \ndiscount window and the other central banks as a \nprimary source of liquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity \nrequirement for large banking organizations that is \nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” \nstable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” \namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.  \nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, both \nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were \ncompliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, \nbased on the Firm’s interpretation of the final NSFR \nrule.

Reductions in these ratings could have \nan adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity \nsources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional \ncollateral or funding requirements and decrease the \nnumber of investors and counterparties willing to lend \nto the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of \nratings downgrades depends on numerous \ncontractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm \nbelieves are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress \ntesting metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains \nsufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in \nfunding capacity due to ratings downgrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs \nand other third-party commitments may be adversely \naffected by a decline in credit ratings.

These events could contribute to \nfinancial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement \nactions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as \nother harm to the Firm. \nOrganization and management \nReputation Risk Management is an independent risk \nmanagement function that establishes the governance \nframework for managing reputation risk across the \nFirm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is \ninherently challenging to identify, manage, and \nquantify.\nThe Firm’s reputation risk management function \nincludes the following activities:\n• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance \npolicy and a standard consistent with the reputation \nrisk framework \n• Providing oversight of the governance framework \nthrough processes and infrastructure to support \nconsistent identification, escalation and monitoring \nof reputation risk issues Firmwide\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes \nthe principles for managing reputation risk for the \nFirm. It is the responsibility of each LOB and \nCorporate, and the Firm’s employees, to consider the \nreputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer \na new product, engage in a transaction or client \nrelationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a \nbusiness process or consider any other activity. \nEnvironmental impacts and social concerns are \nimportant considerations in assessing the Firm’s \nreputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s \nreputation risk governance.\n116\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with \nthe default or change in credit profile of a client, \ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a \nreduction in expected returns on investments, \nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, \nand investment portfolio risk.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or \nchange in credit profile of a client, counterparty or \ncustomer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of \nclients and customers, ranging from large corporate \nand institutional clients to individual consumers and \nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm \nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home \nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking \nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is \nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting, \nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with \nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through \nits operating services activities (such as cash \nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities \nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit \nrisk through its investment securities portfolio and \ncash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors and measures \ncredit risk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk \npolicies, procedures and limits. The Firm’s credit risk \nmanagement governance includes the following \nactivities:\n• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n• Monitoring and measuring credit risk across all \nportfolio segments, including transaction and \nexposure approval\n• Setting industry and geographic concentration \nlimits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for \ncredit review and analysis\n• Assigning and maintaining credit approval \nauthorities in connection with the approval of credit \nexposure\n• Monitoring and independent assessment of \ncriticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\n• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate \ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several \nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor \nor counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring \ncredit risk vary depending on several factors, including \ntype of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk \nmeasurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status \nand borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-\nrating) and risk management and collection processes \n(e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed \nworkout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on \nthe probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, \nthe loss severity given a default event and the \nexposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and \nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm \nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The \nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit \nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses \nrelated to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and \nthe allowance for investment securities reflects \nestimated credit losses related to the investment \nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and \nCritical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on \npages 161–164 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are \nreflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and \nrepresent the potential volatility of actual losses \nrelative to the established allowances for loan losses \nand lending-related commitments. The analyses for \nthese losses include stress testing that considers \nalternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing \ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress \ntesting process assesses the potential impact of \nalternative economic and business scenarios on \nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic \nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined \ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic \nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress \ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in \ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit \nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing \nprocesses, management also considers additional \nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry \nand country- specific stress scenarios, as appropriate. \nThe Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on \nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as \nwell as to assess the impact of stress on individual \ncounterparties.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n117\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are \ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity \nof the approval and decision-making process for \nextending credit so that credit risks are assessed \naccurately, approved properly, monitored regularly \nand managed actively at both the transaction and \nportfolio levels. The policy framework establishes \ncredit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-\nrating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and \nguidelines for management of distressed exposures. In \naddition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used \nin evaluating and monitoring credit risk are \nindependently validated by groups that are separate \nfrom the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and \nother trends, including any concentrations at the \nportfolio level, as certain of these trends can be \naddressed through changes in underwriting policies \nand portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management \nevaluates delinquency and other trends against \nbusiness expectations, current and forecasted \neconomic conditions, and industry benchmarks. \nHistorical and forecasted economic performance and \ntrends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated \nconsumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring \nof the credit risk profile of the portfolio. \nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an \naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and \ncounterparty level with established concentration \nlimits that are reviewed and revised periodically as \ndeemed appropriate by management. Industry and \ncounterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure \nand economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-\nbased loss constraints.\nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk \nexposure is accomplished through a number of means, \nincluding:\n• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes\n• Loan syndications and participations\n• Loan sales and securitizations\n• Credit derivatives\n• Master netting agreements, and\n• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an \nindependent Credit Review function is responsible for: \n• Independently assessing risk grades assigned to \nexposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio \nand the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by \nresponsible business units; and \n• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit \nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate, \nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk \ngrading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper \nmonitoring and management of credit exposures, \nand compliance with applicable grading policies and \nunderwriting guidelines. \nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer \nand wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective \ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit \nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile \nchanges are reported regularly to senior members of \nCredit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting \nof industry, clients, counterparties and customers, \nproduct and geography are prepared, and the \nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is \nreviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly \nbasis. Through the risk reporting and governance \nstructure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are \nprovided regularly to, and discussed with, risk \ncommittees, senior management and the Board of \nDirectors.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n118\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or \nchange in credit profile of a client, counterparty or \ncustomer.\nIn the following tables, total loans include loans \nretained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; \nand certain loans accounted for at fair value.

The contractual amounts of these \nfinancial instruments represent the maximum possible \ncredit risk should the clients draw down on these \ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations \nunder these guarantees, and the clients subsequently \nfail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. \nMost of these commitments and guarantees have \nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or \nexpired without being drawn upon or a default \noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the \ntotal contractual amount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative of the Firm’s \nexpected future credit exposure or funding \nrequirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information \non wholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment \nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM \nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the \nclients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, \nand primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or \nequity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm \nestablishes margin requirements and monitors the \nrequired margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires \nclients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or \nto reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising \nfrom lending activities subject to collateral maintenance \nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such as \nthe short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of \ncollateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the \nborrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when \nthe fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these \nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not \nrequire an allowance for credit losses. However, if in \nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses \nis required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses \nbased on the value of the collateral and probability of \nborrower default. These receivables are reported within \naccrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s \nConsolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s \naccounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage \nrisk, including credit risk and risks arising from \nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and \nequities and commodities prices. The Firm makes \nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and \nuses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with \nnet open risk positions from its market-making \nactivities, including the counterparty credit risk arising \nfrom derivative receivables. The Firm also uses \nderivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and \nother market risk exposure. The nature of the \ncounterparty and the settlement mechanism of the \nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is \nexposed. For over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, the \nFirm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative \ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), \nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also \nbe exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where \npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk \nexposures arising from derivative contracts through the \nuse of legally enforceable master netting arrangements \nand collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s \nOTC derivative transactions subject to collateral \nagreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, \nwhich are not typically covered by collateral agreements \ndue to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades \nthat are settled daily — was approximately 86% and 87% \nat December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to \nNote 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of \ncollateral agreements and for a further discussion of \nderivative contracts, counterparties and settlement \ntypes.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the \nConsolidated balance sheets was $61.0 billion and $54.9 \nbillion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The \nincrease was primarily as a result of market movements. \nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of the \nderivative contracts after giving effect to legally \nenforceable master netting agreements and the related \ncash collateral held by the Firm.\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other \ncash collateral that may be used as security when the \nfair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. \nFor these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is \nconsistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets \nas defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of \ncurrent credit risk should also take into consideration \nother collateral, which generally represents securities \nthat do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the \nLCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral \namounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally \nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to the \nnet amount of the derivative receivables for each \ncounterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, \nG7 government securities, other liquid government \nagency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt \nand equity securities) delivered by clients at the \ninitiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to \ncontracts that have a non-daily call frequency and \ncollateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not \nyet settled as of the reporting date. Although this \ncollateral does not reduce the receivables balances and \nis not included in the tables below, it is available as \nsecurity against potential exposure that could arise \nshould the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts \nmove in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional \ninformation on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements \nfor derivative transactions.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n134\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.\nDerivative receivables\nDecember 31, (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nTotal, net of cash collateral\n$ \n60,967 $ \n54,864 \nLiquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables"

To capture this variability, the Firm \ncalculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures \nof potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, \nDerivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average \nexposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate \nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential \nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, \nto a counterparty calculated in a manner that is \nbroadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the \nlife of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure \nused by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative \ncontracts, senior management reporting and \nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of \nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, \non a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan \nexposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential \ncredit loss than Peak.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of \nthe Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit \nof collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total \nlife of the derivative contract is used as the primary \nmetric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate \ncredit risk capital and CVA, as further described below. \nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables \nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of \ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a \ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in \nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that \nactive risk management is essential to controlling the \ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In \naddition, the Firm’s risk management process for \nderivatives exposures takes into consideration the \npotential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly \ndefined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is \npositively correlated with the impact of a default by the \nsame counterparty, which could cause exposure to \nincrease at the same time as the counterparty’s \ncapacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many \nfactors may influence the nature and magnitude of \nthese correlations over time. To the extent that these \ncorrelations are identified, the Firm may adjust the \nCVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. \nThe Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by \nentering into credit derivative contracts, as well as \ninterest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity \nderivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s \ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as \ncalculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics.

This \nasymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans \nand lending-related commitments and the credit \nderivatives used in credit portfolio management \nactivities, causes earnings volatility that is not \nrepresentative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes \nin value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.\nThe effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a \nhedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary \ndepending on a number of factors, including the \nnamed reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience \nlosses on specific exposures that are different than the \nnamed reference entities in the purchased CDS); the \ncontractual terms of the CDS (which may have a \ndefined credit event that does not align with an actual \nloss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the \nFirm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be \nshorter than the Firm’s exposures).

The \nFirm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of:\n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the \nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated) and is presented separately on the \nConsolidated balance sheets,\n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, \nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other \nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities, which is reflected in investment securities \non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, \n2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 \nbillion from December 31, 2023.\nThe net addition to the allowance for credit losses \nincluded:\n• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting:\n– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, \npredominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting \nhigher revolving balances, including the seasoning \nof vintages originated in recent years, \npartially offset by\n– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in \nthe first quarter of 2024, and \n• a net reduction of $30 million in wholesale, \nreflecting:\n– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an \nupdate to loss assumptions on certain loans in \nMarkets, and a reduction due to charge-offs \nlargely from collateral-dependent loans, \npredominantly offset by \n– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, \nand the impact of incorporating the First Republic \nportfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss \nestimates in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to \ninclude additional weight placed on the adverse \nscenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and \ndownside risks related to the geopolitical and \nmacroeconomic environment.\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated \nusing a weighted average of five internally developed \nmacroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios \nincorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors \nthan the central case assumptions provided in the \ntable below, resulting in:\n• a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking \nat 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and\n• a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% \nlower than the central case at the end of the second \nquarter of 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case \nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions \nat December 31, 2024\n2Q25\n4Q25\n2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n 4.5 %\n 4.3 %\n 4.3 %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)\n 2.0 %\n 1.9 %\n 1.8 %\nCentral case assumptions \nat December 31, 2023\n2Q24\n4Q24\n2Q25\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n 4.1 %\n 4.4 %\n 4.1 %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP\n(b)\n 1.8 %\n 0.7 %\n 1.0 %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment \nrate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast \nhorizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage \nchange in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related \nestimates will be reflected in the provision for credit \nlosses in future periods. \nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–125, \nWholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 126–136 and Note \n12 for additional information on the consumer and \nwholesale credit portfolios.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the \nFirm on pages 161–164 for further information on the \nallowance for credit losses and related management \njudgments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n137\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\n2024\n2023\nYear ended December 31,\nConsumer, \nexcluding \ncredit card\nCredit card\nWholesale\nTotal\nConsumer, \nexcluding \ncredit card\nCredit card\nWholesale\nTotal\n(in millions, except ratios)\nAllowance for loan losses\nBeginning balance at January 1,\n$ 1,856 \n$ 12,450 \n$ \n8,114 \n$ 22,420 \n$ 2,040 \n$ 11,200 \n$ 6,486 \n$ \n19,726 \nCumulative effect of a change in \naccounting principle(a)\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA"

The Firm also conducts stress testing on \nthese portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate \nlosses based on significant market moves and/or \nother risk events.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n140\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of \nchanges in market factors such as interest and foreign \nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit \nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets \nand liabilities held for both the short and long term.  \nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks \nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk policies \nand procedures. \nMarket Risk Management seeks to facilitate efficient \nrisk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating \nperformance and provide transparency into the Firm’s \nmarket risk profile for senior management, the Board \nof Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management \nis responsible for the following functions:\n• Maintaining a market risk policy framework\n• Independently measuring and monitoring LOB, \nCorporate, and Firmwide market risk\n• Defining, approving and monitoring limits\n• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk \nassessments\nRisk measurement\nMeasures used to capture market risk \nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and \ntherefore Market Risk Management uses various \nmetrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess \nrisk including:\n• Value-at-risk \n• Stress testing\n• Profit and loss drawdowns \n• Earnings-at-risk\n• Economic Value Sensitivity\n• Other sensitivity-based measures\nRisk monitoring and control \nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a \nseries of limits set in the context of the market \nenvironment and business strategy. In setting limits, \nMarket Risk Management takes into consideration \nfactors such as market volatility, product liquidity, \naccommodation of client business, and management \njudgment. Market Risk Management maintains \ndifferent levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR \nand stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits \ninclude VaR and stress limits and may be \nsupplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures \nsuch as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be \nset within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the \nlegal entity level.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly \nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior \nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and \napproving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing \nbasis. Limits that have not been reviewed within \nspecified time periods by Market Risk Management \nare reported to senior management. The LOBs and \nCorporate are responsible for adhering to established \nlimits against which exposures are monitored and \nreported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely \nmanner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk \nManagement and senior management. In the event of \na breach, Market Risk Management consults with \nsenior members of appropriate groups within the Firm \nto determine the suitable course of action required to \nreturn the applicable positions to compliance, which \nmay include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the \nbreach or granting a temporary increase in limits to \naccommodate an expected increase in client activity \nand/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level \nlimit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently \nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure \ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may \nbe heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market \nconditions occur. For additional discussion on model \nuncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk \nManagement on page 160.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the \nFirm’s existing market risk measures to identify \nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent \nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly \nover time. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n141\nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions \nwhich give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. \nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing \nactivities.

The Firm has a single VaR framework \nused as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR \nand Regulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using \nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous 12 \nmonths. The framework’s approach assumes that \nhistorical changes in market values are representative \nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the \nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk \nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that \nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made \nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other \nmarket risk measures, provides the appropriate \ninformation needed to respond to risk events. \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated \nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected \ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% \nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a \nconsistent framework to measure risk profiles and \nlevels of diversification across product types and is \nused for aggregating risks and monitoring limits \nacross businesses. VaR results are reported as \nappropriate to various groups including senior \nmanagement, the Board Risk Committee and \nregulators.  \nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are \nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market \nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product types. \nTo capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s \nrisk management framework, comprehensive VaR \nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses \nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR \nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk \nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market \nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected \nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as \nsensitivities and historical time series used to generate \ndaily market values may be different across product \ntypes or risk management systems. The VaR model \nresults across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm \nlevel.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect \nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future \nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on available \nhistorical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, \nVaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to \nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses, \nparticularly those associated with market illiquidity \nand sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. \nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not \ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and \navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm \nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other \nproducts when daily time series are not available. It is \nlikely that using an actual price-based time series for \nthese products, if available, would affect the VaR \nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other \nnonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in \naddition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk \npositions. \nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a \nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market data \nused may be different than the independent third-\nparty data collected for VCG price testing in its \nmonthly valuation process. For example, in cases \nwhere market prices are not observable, or where \nproxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data \nsources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note \n2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation \nprocess. \nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically \nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the \ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in \nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s \nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other \nfactors. Such changes may affect historical \ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and \nModel Risk Management on page 160 for information \nregarding model reviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR \nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory \nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory \nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital \nrules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently \nassumes a ten business-day holding period and an \nexpected tail-loss methodology which approximates a \n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to \n“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, \nwhich may be different than the positions included in \nthe Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit \nderivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the \nFirm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR \nexcludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in \ncontrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, \nRegulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification \nbenefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory \nCapital Disclosures reports, which are available on the \nFirm’s website, for additional information on \nRegulatory VaR and the other components of market \nrisk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based \nmeasure, stressed VaR-based measure and the \nrespective backtesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n143\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not \nreported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties \nwas removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related \nhedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to disaggregate AWM VaR due to the increase \nassociated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments.

The gains and losses depicted \nin the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported \nrevenue as they exclude certain components of total \nnet revenue, such as those associated with the \nexecution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-\ndriven trading and intraday risk management \nactivities), fees, commissions, other valuation \nadjustments and net interest income. These excluded \ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset \nthe backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The \ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is \nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting \nunder Basel III capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily \nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management \nVaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk \nManagement VaR methodology, assuming current \nchanges in market values are consistent with the \nhistorical changes used in the simulation, the Firm \nwould expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five \ntimes every 100 trading days on average. The number \nof VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ \nfrom the statistically expected number of backtesting \nexceptions if the current level of market volatility is \nmaterially different from the level of market volatility \nduring the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR \ncalculation.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Firm \nposted backtesting gains on 179 of the 260 days, and \nobserved eight VaR backtesting exceptions, of which \nthree were in the three months ended December 31, \n2024. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from \nthe loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and \nEquity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB \nMarkets revenue, as the population of positions which \ncomprise each metric are different and due to the \nexclusion of certain components of total net revenue in \nbacktesting gains and losses as described above. \nThe following chart presents the distribution of \nFirmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the \ntrailing 12 months and three months ended \nDecember 31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are \ndisplayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily \nRisk Management VaR.

While VaR reflects the risk of loss \ndue to adverse changes in markets using recent \nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects the \nrisk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of \nmarket risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. \nStress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to \nlosses under a range of stressed but possible \neconomic and market scenarios. The results are used \nto understand the exposures responsible for those \npotential losses and are measured against limits. \nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk \nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The \nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of \npotential stress for both market rallies and market sell-\noffs, assuming significant changes in market factors \nsuch as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, \ncurrency rates and commodity prices, and combines \nthem in multiple ways to capture an array of \nhypothetical economic and market scenarios.  \nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus \non tail events in specific asset classes and \ngeographies, including how the event may impact \nmultiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also \nincorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress \nbasis risk between different products. The flexibility in \nthe stress framework allows the Firm to construct new \nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible \nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are \nreported periodically to senior management of the \nFirm, as appropriate. \nStress methodologies are governed by the overall \nstress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk \nManagement. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress \nMethodology Committee reviews and approves \nchanges to stress testing methodology and scenarios \nacross the Firm. Significant changes to the framework \nare escalated to senior management, as appropriate. \nIn addition, stress methodology and the models to \ncalculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s \nEstimations and Model Risk Management Policy  \nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in \ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test \nresults, which are reported periodically to the Board of \nDirectors. In addition, stress testing results are \nincorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, \nand are reported periodically to the Board Risk \nCommittee. \nProfit and loss drawdowns \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight \ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A \nprofit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from \nits year-to-date peak level.\nStructural interest rate risk management \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s \nreported net income is important as interest rate risk \nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. \nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading activities \nwhich are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s \ntraditional banking activities, which include extension \nof loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing \ndebt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and \nassociated derivative instruments. Refer to the table \non page 142 for a summary by LOB and Corporate \nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nGovernance\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s \ninterest rate risk management policy and related \nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk \nCommittee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership \nwith the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest \nrate risk profile and reviews it with senior \nmanagement, including the CTC Risk Committee. In \naddition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is \nmanaged through a dedicated risk function reporting \nto the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for \nproviding independent oversight and governance \naround assumptions and establishing and monitoring \nlimits for structural interest rate risk, including limits \nrelated to Earnings-at-Risk and Economic Value \nSensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate \nrisk generally through its investment securities \nportfolio and interest rate derivatives.\nKey risk drivers and risk management process\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of \nfactors, including:\n• Differences in timing among the maturity or \nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet \ninstruments\n• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and \noff-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or \nrepricing at the same time\n• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and \nlong-term market interest rates change (for \nexample, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n• The impact of changes in the maturity of various \nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as \ninterest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its \nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide \nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to \nTreasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, \nwhich takes into account the elements of interest rate \nexposure that can be risk-managed in financial \nmarkets. These elements include asset and liability \nbalances and contractual rates of interest, contractual \nprincipal payment schedules, expected prepayment \nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n146\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nexperience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, \nrate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate \nceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\nEarnings-at-Risk\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest \nrate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk \nestimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given \ninterest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to \na baseline, which includes net interest income and \ncertain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses \nmarket interest rates and, in the case of deposits, \npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of \nchanges to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive \nassets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and \nother currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These \nsimulations primarily include retained and held-for-\nsale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing \nactivities, investment securities, long-term debt,  \nrelated interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing \nof other positions in risk management VaR and other \nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 142. \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these \nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar \nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital \ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange \nrisk on page 149 for more information.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential \nchange to a baseline over the following 12 months \nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios \ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both short-\nterm and long-term rates by an equal amount; a \nsteeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates \nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter \nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and \nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-\nterm rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. \nThese scenarios consider many different factors, \nincluding: \n• The impact on exposures as a result of \ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from \nbaseline rates.\n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled \nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but \nexcluding assumptions about actions that could be \ntaken by the Firm or its clients and customers in \nresponse to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage \nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest \nrates used in the scenarios compared with \nunderlying contractual rates, the time since \norigination, and other factors which are updated \nperiodically based on historical experience. Deposit \nforecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s \nearnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain \nassumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s \nbalance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening \nand usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that \nrequire management judgment. The amount of \ndeposits that the Firm holds at any given time may \nbe influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as \nbroader monetary conditions and competition for \ndeposits.\n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit \nbetas, represent the amount by which deposit rates \npaid could change upon a given change in market \ninterest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ \nfrom the modeled assumptions, primarily due to \ncustomer behavior and competition for deposits.\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the \nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, \nincluding with respect to deposit betas and forecasts \nof deposit balances, both of which are especially \nsignificant in the case of consumer deposits. The \nresults of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the \nCTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically \nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the \ncomposition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in \nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s \nsimulation and other factors. In the second quarter of \n2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid \nassumptions which take into account observed pricing \nand client and customer behavior during the most \nrecent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates \npaid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, \nresulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in higher \ninterest rate scenarios, and an increase in negative \nsensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures \nof the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s actual \nnet interest income for the rate changes presented \nmay differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are \nmodelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any \nactions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients or \ncustomers in response to rate changes. Other \nsignificant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk \nscenarios, including mortgage prepayments and \ndeposit rates paid, may also differ from actual results. \nThe Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included \nin the Firm’s outlook on page 57.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n147\nThe Firm’s sensitivities are presented in the table \nbelow. \nDecember 31,\n(in billions)\n2024(a)\n2023(b)\nParallel shift:\n+100 bps shift in rates\n$ \n2.3 \n$ \n3.1 \n-100 bps shift in rates"

The Country Risk Management group \nactively monitors the various portfolios which may be \nimpacted by these developments and measures the \nextent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified \ngiven the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to \na country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk \nmanagement function that assesses and monitors \nexposure to country risk across the Firm. \nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes \nthe following activities:\n• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards \nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk \nframework\n• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks \nand establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\n• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure \nand stress across the Firm\n• Managing and approving country limits and \nreporting trends and limit breaches to senior \nmanagement\n• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling \nmodels and ratings indicators, for early identification \nof potential country risk concerns\n• Providing country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending \nand deposits, investing, and market-making activities, \nwhether cross-border or locally funded. Country \nexposure includes activity with both government and \nprivate-sector entities in a country. \nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management \napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual \ncountry is based on the country where the largest \nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, \nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest \nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be \ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or \ncountry of incorporation. \nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of \nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero \nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or \nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities which \nresult in contingent or indirect exposure to a country \nare not included in the country exposure measure (for \nexample, providing clearing services or secondary \nexposure to collateral on securities financing \nreceivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining \nthe measurement and allocation of country exposure, \nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or index \nproducts, or where the nature of the counterparty, \nissuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for \nattribution to an individual country. The use of \ndifferent measurement approaches or assumptions \ncould affect the amount of reported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement \nframework:\n• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash \nbalances placed with central banks, commercial \nbanks, and other financial institutions\n• Lending exposures are measured at the total \ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of \nthe allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and \nmarketable securities collateral received\n• Securities financing exposures are measured at their \nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral received\n• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair \nvalue of all positions, including both long and short \npositions\n• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is \nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair \nvalue of the eligible collateral received\n• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net \nnotional amount of protection purchased or sold for \nthe same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the \nfair value of the derivative receivable or payable, \nreflecting the manner in which the Firm manages \nthese exposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from \nthe reporting provided under the FFIEC bank \nregulatory requirements.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n150\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nStress testing\nStress testing is an important component of the Firm’s \ncountry risk management framework, which aims to \nestimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis \nby measuring the impact of adverse asset price \nmovements to a country based on market shocks \ncombined with counterparty specific assumptions. \nCountry Risk Management periodically designs and \nruns tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to \nindividual countries or  sets of countries in response to \nspecific or potential market events, sector \nperformance concerns, sovereign actions and \ngeopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are \nused to  inform potential risk reduction across the \nFirm, as necessary.\nRisk reporting\nCountry exposure and stress are measured and \nreported regularly, and used by Country Risk \nManagement to identify trends and monitor high \nusages and breaches against limits.  \nFor country risk management purposes, the Firm may \nreport exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully \nautonomous, including dependent territories and \nSpecial Administrative Regions (“SAR”) such as Hong \nKong SAR, separately from the independent sovereign \nstates with which they are associated.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s top 20 \nexposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of \nDecember 31, 2024, and their comparative exposures \nas of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country \nexposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures \nby individual country. Country exposures may \nfluctuate from period to period due to a variety of \nfactors, including client activity, market flows and \nliquidity management activities undertaken by the \nFirm. \nThe increase in exposure to Germany when compared \nto December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in \ncash placed with the central bank of Germany, \npredominantly due to client-driven market-making \nactivities and higher client deposits.\nThe increase in exposure to Japan when compared to \nDecember 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash \nplaced with the central bank of Japan as a result of \nclient-driven market-making activities.\nThe Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, \nwhich corresponds to cash placed with the central \nbank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of \nclients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia.

Climate change is \nviewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing \ntypes of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is \ncategorized into physical risk and transition risk.\nPhysical risk involves economic costs and financial \nlosses due to a changing climate. Acute physical risk \ndrivers include the increased frequency or severity of \nclimate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires \nand tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers \ninclude more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea \nlevel rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels \nand increases in average ambient temperatures.\nTransition risk involves the financial and economic \nconsequences of society’s shift toward a lower-carbon \neconomy. Transition risk drivers include possible \nchanges in public policy, adoption of new technologies \nand shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks \nmay also be influenced by changes in the physical \nclimate.\nOrganization and management\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that \nis responsible for establishing and maintaining the \nFirmwide framework and strategy for managing \nclimate risks that may impact the Firm.\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management \ninclude:\n• Setting policies, standards, procedures and \nprocesses to support identification, escalation, \nmonitoring and management of climate risk across \nthe Firm\n• Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing \nmechanisms designed to assess the range of \npotential climate-related financial and economic \nimpacts to the Firm\n• Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy \nand the supporting climate risk technology \ninfrastructure\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the \nidentification, assessment and management of climate \nrisks present in their business activities and for the \nadherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules \nand regulations.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s framework and strategy for managing \nclimate risk is integrated into the Firm’s risk \ngovernance structure. This framework allows for the \nescalation of significant climate risk-related issues to \nLOB Risk Committees. The Board Risk Committee also \nreceives information on significant climate risks and \nclimate-related initiatives, as appropriate.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n152\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome \nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes \nor systems; human factors; or external events \nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. \nOperational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, \nand estimations and model risk. Operational risk is \ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself \nin various ways, including fraudulent acts, business \ndisruptions (including those caused by extraordinary \nevents beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, \ninappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply \nwith applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of \nvendors or other third party providers to perform in \naccordance with their agreements. Operational Risk \nManagement attempts to manage operational risk at \nappropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial \nposition, the characteristics of its businesses, and the \nmarkets and regulatory environments in which it \noperates. \nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk \n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to \nenable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor \nand test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational \nrisk. \nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the \nmanagement of operational risk. The Control \nManagement Organization, which consists of control \nmanagers within each LOB and Corporate, is \nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR \nFramework. \nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) \nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk \nAppetite is responsible for defining the CCOR \nManagement Framework and establishing the \nminimum standards for its execution. The LOB and \nCorporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the \nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and \nQualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the \nrespective businesses or functions they oversee. The \nCCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk \nGovernance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and \napproved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and \nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and \nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their \nrespective control environment to assess \ncircumstances in which controls have failed, and to \ndetermine where remediation efforts may be required. \nThe Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance \norganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) \nprovides oversight of and challenge to these \nevaluations and may also perform independent \nassessments of significant operational risk events and \nareas of concentrated or emerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an \nindependent assessment of the operational risks \ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which \nincludes evaluating the effectiveness of the control \nenvironments and reporting the results to senior \nmanagement.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses \noperational risks through quantitative means, \nincluding operational risk-based capital and \nestimation of operational risk losses under both \nbaseline and stressed conditions. \nThe primary component of the operational risk-based \ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach \n(“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the \nprojected frequency and severity of operational risk \nlosses based on historical data. The LDA model is used \nto estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a \none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. \nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal \noperational risk losses in the quarter following the \nperiod in which those losses were realized, and the \ncalculation generally continues to reflect such losses \neven after the issues or business activities giving rise \nto the losses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the \nFirm’s operational risk capital methodology, which \nuses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), \nincorporates internal and external losses as well as \nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through \noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of \nkey business environment and internal control metrics. \nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its \nAMA estimate of operational risk capital. \nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic \nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a \nforward looking view of material operational risk \nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The \nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is \nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and \nother stress testing processes. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 for \ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and \nCCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and Testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by \nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in \nconnection with their independent monitoring and \ntesting compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n153\nlaws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and \ntesting, Operational Risk and Compliance \nindependently identify areas of heightened operational \nrisk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the \nLOBs and Corporate. \nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified through \nmonitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and \nCorporate to be remediated through action plans, as \nneeded, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk \nand Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate \nin the development and implementation of action \nplans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate \nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational \nRisk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate \nLOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. \nOperational Risk and Compliance has established \nstandards designed to ensure that consistent \noperational risk reporting and operational risk reports \nare produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the \nLOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the \nevaluation of key risk and performance indicators \nagainst established thresholds as well as the \nassessment of different types of operational risk \nagainst stated risk appetite. The standards establish \nescalation protocols to senior management and to the \nBoard of Directors.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be \nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. \nThe Firm purchases insurance from commercial \ninsurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, \nPark Assurance Company. Insurance may also be \nrequired by third parties with whom the Firm does \nbusiness.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. \nOperational risk subcategories include Compliance \nrisk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and \nModel risk. Refer to pages 157, 158, 159 and 160, \nrespectively for more information on Compliance, \nConduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. \nDetails on other select examples of operational risks \nsuch as business and technology resiliency, payment \nfraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as \ncybersecurity, are provided below. \nFirmwide resiliency risk \nDisruptions of the Firm’s business and operations can \noccur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as \nthe spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe \nweather, natural disasters, the effects of climate \nchange, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a \nthird party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, \ncivil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firm’s \nresiliency framework is intended to enable the Firm to \nprepare for and adapt to changing conditions and \nwithstand and recover from, and address adverse \neffects on its operations caused by, disruptions that \nmay impact critical business functions and supporting \nassets, including its staff, technology, data and \nfacilities, as well as those of third-party service \nproviders. The framework includes governance, \nawareness training, planning and testing of recovery \nstrategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to \nidentify, assess, and manage resiliency risks. The \nframework operates in accordance with the Firm’s \noverall approach to Operational Risk Management, \nincluding alignment with technology, cybersecurity, \ndata, physical security, crisis management, real estate \nand outsourcing programs.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal \nparties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit \nthrough misdirected or otherwise improper payment. \nThe Firm employs various controls for managing \npayment fraud risk as well as providing employee and \nclient education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs \nand Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, \nmonitoring and managing their supplier relationships \nincluding services provided by affiliates. The \nobjectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers \nand other third parties to an appropriate standard of \noperational performance and to mitigate key risks, \nincluding data loss and business disruptions. The \nCorporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible \nfor Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and \nstandards with respect to third-party outsourcing \nrisks.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n154\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting \nfrom misuse or abuse of technology or the \nunauthorized disclosure of data. \nOverview\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously \nevolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are \ndevoted to protecting and enhancing the security of \ncomputer systems, software, networks, storage \ndevices, and other technology. The Firm’s security \nefforts are designed to protect against, among other \nthings, cybersecurity attacks that can result in \nunauthorized access to confidential information, the \ndestruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of \nservice, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. \nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will \ncontinue to experience, a higher volume and \ncomplexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of \nheightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has \nimplemented measures and controls reasonably \ndesigned to address this evolving environment, \nincluding enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the \nFirm continues to review and enhance its capabilities \nto address associated risks, such as those relating to \nthe management of administrative access to systems.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business, that \nfacilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, \nsupply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central \ndepositories, and financial intermediaries) or that the \nFirm has acquired are also sources of cybersecurity \nrisk to the Firm. Third party incidents such as system \nbreakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees \nof such parties, or cyber attacks, including \nransomware and supply-chain compromises, could \nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm, including in \ncircumstances in which an affected third party is \nunable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or \nwhere the incident delivers compromised software to \nthe Firm or results in lost or compromised information \nof the Firm or its clients or customers.\nClients and customers are also sources of \ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information \nassets, particularly when their activities and systems \nare beyond the Firm’s own security and control \nsystems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions \nwith its clients, customers and other external parties \nconcerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities \nto improve cybersecurity.\nRisks from cybersecurity threats, including any \nprevious cybersecurity events, have not materially \naffected the Firm or its business strategy, results of \noperations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the \ncomprehensive approach that the Firm takes to \naddress cybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be \nsuccessful in preventing or mitigating a future \ncybersecurity incident that could have a material \nadverse effect on the Firm or its business strategy, \nresults of operations or financial condition.\nOrganization and management \nThe Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) \nreports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a \nmember of key cybersecurity governance forums. The \nCISO leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology \nControls organization, which is responsible for \nidentifying technology and cybersecurity risks and for \nimplementing and maintaining controls to manage \ncybersecurity threats. The CISO and the members of \nsenior management within Global Technology and the \nCybersecurity and Technology Controls organizations \nall have relevant expertise and experience in \ncybersecurity and information technology risk \nmanagement, including relevant experience at the \nFirm, at other financial services companies or in other \nhighly-regulated industries.\nThe CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information \nSecurity Program, which is designed to prevent, detect \nand respond to cyber attacks in order to help \nsafeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof the Firm's infrastructure, resources and information. \nThe program includes managing the Firm’s global \ncybersecurity operations centers, providing training, \nconducting cybersecurity event simulation exercises, \nimplementing the Firm’s policies and standards \nrelating to technology risk and cybersecurity \nmanagement, and enhancing, as needed, the Firm’s \ncybersecurity capabilities. \nThe Firm’s Information Security Program includes the \nfollowing functions:\nCyber Operations, which is responsible for \nimplementing and maintaining controls designed to \ndetect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and \nincludes a dedicated function for incident response \nand ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and \nvulnerabilities, including those among the Firm’s third-\nparty suppliers.\nTechnology Governance, Risk & Controls, which is \nresponsible for operationalizing technology risk and \ncontrol frameworks, analyzing regulatory \ndevelopments that may impact the Firm, and \ndeveloping control catalogs and assessments of \ncontrols, as well as overseeing governance and \nreporting of technology and cybersecurity risk.\nSecurity Awareness, which provides awareness and \ntraining that reinforces information risk and security \nmanagement practices and compliance with the Firm's \npolicies, standards and practices. The training is \nmandatory for all employees globally on a periodic \nbasis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing \ninitiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm \nalso provides specialized security training to  \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n155\nemployees in specific roles, such as application \ndevelopers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program \nrequires all employees to take periodic training on \ndata privacy that focuses on confidentiality and \nsecurity, as well as responding to unauthorized access \nto or use of information.\nTechnology Resiliency, which establishes control \nrequirements for planning and testing the prioritized \nrecovery of technology services in the event of \ndegradation or outage, including incident response \nplanning, data backup and retention, and recovery \nreadiness in support of the Firmwide Business \nResiliency Program and operational risk management \npractices.\nThe Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan \ndesigned to enable the Firm to respond to attempted \ncybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate \nwith law enforcement and other government agencies, \nnotify clients and customers, as applicable, and \nrecover from such incidents.

Cybersecurity risk management \nand its governance and oversight are integrated into \nthe Firm’s operational risk management framework, \nincluding through the escalation of key risk and control \nissues to management and the development of risk \nmitigation plans for heightened risk and control issues. \nIRM independently assesses and challenges the \nactivities and risk management practices of the Global \nCybersecurity and Technology Controls organization \nrelated to the identification, assessment, \nmeasurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As \nneeded, the Firm engages third-party assessors or \nauditing firms with industry-recognized expertise on \ncybersecurity matters to review specific aspects of the \nFirm’s cybersecurity risk management framework, \nprocesses and controls.\nThe governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk \nmanagement includes governance forums that inform \nmanagement of key areas of concern regarding the \nprevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of \ncybersecurity risks. \nThe Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating \nCommittee (“CTOC”) is the principal management \ncommittee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and \nmanagement of cybersecurity risk, including oversight \nof the implementation and maintenance of appropriate \ncontrols in support of the Firm’s Information Security \nProgram. The membership of the CTOC includes \nsenior representatives from the Global Cybersecurity \nand Technology Controls organization and relevant \ncorporate functions, including IRM and Internal Audit. \nThe CTOC escalates key operational risk and control \nissues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology \nOperating Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control \ncommittee or to the appropriate LOB and Corporate \nControl Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the \ngovernance of the Firmwide Global Technology \norganization, including oversight of Firmwide \ntechnology strategies, the delivery of technology and \ntechnology operations, the effective use of information \ntechnology resources, and monitoring and resolving \nkey operational risk and control matters arising in the \nGlobal Technology organization.\nAs part of its oversight of management’s \nimplementation and maintenance of the Firm’s risk \nmanagement framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors \nreceives periodic updates from the CIO, the CISO and \nsenior members of the CTOC concerning \ncybersecurity matters. These updates generally \ninclude information regarding cybersecurity and \ntechnology developments, the Firm’s Information \nSecurity Program and recommended changes to that \nprogram, cybersecurity policies and practices, and \nongoing initiatives to improve information security, as \nwell as any significant cybersecurity incidents and the \nFirm's efforts to address those incidents. The Audit \nCommittee and the Risk Committee assist the Board in \nthis oversight.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n156\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is \nthe risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations \nor codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory \norganizations. \nOverview\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary \nownership of and accountability for managing their \ncompliance risk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and \nCompliance Organization (“Operational Risk and \nCompliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and \nCorporate, provides independent review, monitoring \nand oversight of business operations with a focus on \ncompliance with the laws, rules, and regulations \napplicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and \nservices to clients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, \nrules and regulations across the LOBs and Corporate, \nand jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial \nproducts and services, relationships and interactions \nwith clients and customers, and employee activities. \nFor example, compliance risks include those \nassociated with anti-money laundering compliance, \ntrading activities, market conduct, and complying with \nthe laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering \nof products and services across jurisdictional borders. \nCompliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary \nactivities, including the failure to exercise the \napplicable standard of care to act in the best interest \nof fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary \nclients and customers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant \nregulatory obligations that are specific to their \nrespective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies \nand standards designed to govern, identify, measure, \nmonitor and test, manage, and report on compliance \nrisk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s \nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and \nQualitative Risk Appetite.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its \ncompliance risk through the CCOR Management \nFramework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for \nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also \nprovides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee \nand the Audit Committee on significant compliance \nrisk issues, as appropriate. \nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets \nforth the Firm’s expectation that employees will \nconduct themselves with integrity, at all times. The \nCode provides the principles that help govern \nemployee conduct with clients, customers, suppliers, \nvendors, shareholders, regulators, other employees, as \nwell as with the markets and communities in which the \nFirm operates. The Code requires employees to \npromptly report any potential or actual violation of the \nCode, Firm policies, or laws, rules or regulations \napplicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires \nemployees to report any illegal or unethical conduct, \nor conduct that violates the underlying principles of \nthe Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, \nclients, customers, suppliers, contract or temporary \nworkers, or business partners or agents. Training is \nassigned to newly hired employees after joining the \nFirm, and to current employees periodically thereafter. \nEmployees are required to affirm their compliance with \nthe Code annually. \nEmployees can report any potential or actual violations \nof the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline (the \n“Hotline”) by phone, mobile device or the internet. The \nHotline is anonymous, where permitted by law, is \navailable at all times globally, has translation services, \nand is administered by an outside service provider. \nThe Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who \nraises an issue or concern in good faith or assists with \nan inquiry or investigation. Periodically, the Audit \nCommittee receives reports on the Code of Conduct \nprogram.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n157\nCONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT\nConduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the \nrisk that any action or misconduct by an employee \ncould lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, \nimpact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm \noperates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise \nthe Firm’s reputation.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying \nand managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate \nengagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture \nconsistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The \nBusiness Principles serve as a guide for how \nemployees are expected to conduct themselves. With \nthe Business Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s \nCode sets out the Firm’s expectations for each \nemployee and provides information and resources to \nhelp employees conduct business ethically and in \ncompliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations \neverywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance \nRisk Management on page 157 for further discussion of \nthe Code.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s oversight and coordination of conduct risk \nis managed in the same manner as Compliance risk. \nRefer to Compliance Risk Management on page 157 for \nfurther information.\nConduct risk management encompasses various \naspects of people management practices throughout \nthe employee life cycle, including recruiting, \nonboarding, training and development, performance \nmanagement, promotion and compensation \nprocesses. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each \ndesignated corporate function completes an \nassessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews \nmetrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, \nand provides conduct education as appropriate. \nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n158\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nLEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nLegal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk \nof loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure \nto meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law \nin jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements \nwith clients and customers, and products and services \noffered by the Firm. \nOverview\nThe global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal \nservices and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible \nfor managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:\n• managing actual and potential litigation and \nenforcement matters, including internal reviews and \ninvestigations related to such matters\n• advising on products and services, including \ncontract negotiation and documentation\n• advising on offering and marketing documents and \nnew business initiatives\n• managing dispute resolution\n• interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and \nadvising on changes to them\n• advising on advocacy in connection with \ncontemplated and proposed laws, rules and \nregulations, and \n• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and \nthe Board. \nLegal selects, engages and manages outside counsel \nfor the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is \nengaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts \nOffice which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions \nthat may have the potential to create conflicts of \ninterest for the Firm. \nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a \nmember of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide \nRisk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. \nThe Firm’s General Counsel and other members of \nLegal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s \nBoard of Directors and to the Audit Committee. \nLegal serves on and advises various committees and \nadvises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential \nreputation risk issues.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n159\nESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\nEstimations and Model risk, a subcategory of \noperational risk, is the potential for adverse \nconsequences from decisions based on incorrect or \nmisused estimation outputs. \nThe Firm uses models and other analytical and \njudgment-based estimations, including those based \nupon machine learning or artificial intelligence \ntechniques, across various businesses and functions. \nThe estimation methods are of varying levels of \nsophistication and are used for many purposes, such \nas the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, \nassessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting \nstress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit \nlosses and making business decisions. A dedicated \nindependent function, Model Risk Governance and \nReview (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s \npolicies relating to the management of model risk and \nrisks associated with certain analytical and judgment-\nbased estimations, such as those used in risk \nmanagement, budget forecasting and capital planning \nand analysis. \nModel risks are owned by the users of the models \nwithin the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific \npurposes of such models. Users and developers of \nmodels are responsible for developing, implementing \nand testing their models, as well as referring models to \nMRGR for review and approval. Once models have \nbeen approved, model users and developers are \nresponsible for maintaining a robust operating \nenvironment, and must monitor and evaluate the \nperformance of the models on an ongoing basis. \nModel users and developers may seek to enhance \nmodels in response to changes in the relevant \nportfolios and in product and market developments, as \nwell as to capture improvements in available modeling \ntechniques and systems capabilities. \nModels are tiered based on an internal standard \naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated \nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. \nThis tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its \nreview of a model, MRGR considers whether the model \nis suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be \nused. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and \nchallenges the model methodology and the \nreasonableness of model assumptions, and may \nperform or require additional testing, including back-\ntesting of model outcomes. Model reviews are \napproved by the appropriate level of management \nwithin MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk \nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new \nmodels, as well as material changes to existing \nmodels, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, \nexceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to \nallow a model to be used prior to review or approval. \nMRGR may also require the user to take appropriate \nactions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in \nthe interim. These actions will depend on the model \nand may include, for example, limitation of trading \nactivity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of \nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the \nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly \ntrue when the current and forecasted environments \nare significantly different from the historical \nenvironments upon which the models were developed. \nThis increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater \ndegree of judgment and analytics to inform any \nadjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs \nthan would otherwise be the case. In addition, the Firm \nmay experience increased uncertainty in its estimates \nif assets acquired differ from those used to develop \nthe models.   \nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the \nFirm on pages 161–164 and Note 2 for a summary of \nmodel-based valuations and other valuation \ntechniques.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n160\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM \nJPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of \nestimates are integral to understanding its reported \nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting \nestimates require management’s judgment to \nascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and \nliabilities. The Firm has established policies and \ncontrol procedures intended to ensure that estimation \nmethods, including any judgments made as part of \nsuch methods, are well-controlled, independently \nreviewed and applied consistently from period to \nperiod. The methods used and judgments made \nreflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or \nliabilities and the related business and risk \nmanagement strategies, which may vary across the \nFirm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the \npolicies and procedures are intended to ensure that \nthe process for changing methodologies occurs in an \nappropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates \nfor determining the carrying value of its assets and \nliabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief \ndescription of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates \ninvolving significant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents \nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over \nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial \nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The \nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the \nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n• The allowance for lending-related commitments, \nand\n• The allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant \njudgment on a number of matters including \ndevelopment and weighting of macroeconomic \nforecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, \nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk \nratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination \nof remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note \n13 for further information on these judgments as well \nas the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to \ndetermine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in \nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses \nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to \nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast \nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of \nmacroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant \nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit \nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less than \ntwenty variables. The specific variables that have the \ngreatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio \nand geography.\n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include \nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. \nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. \ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil \nprices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. \nHPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of \neconomic conditions could significantly affect its \nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at \nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in \nthe estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm \nrecorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans \nacquired and lending-related commitments assumed \nas of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in risk rating \nmethodologies for the First Republic portfolio and the \nongoing integration of products and systems, the \nallowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale \nportfolio was initially measured based on similar risk \ncharacteristics from other facilities underwritten by \nthe Firm. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, the \nacquired portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's \nmodeled credit loss estimates and is now reflected in \nthe wholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note \n34 for additional information on the First Republic \nacquisition. \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any \none factor or input might affect the overall allowance \nfor credit losses because management considers a \nwide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the \nallowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and \ninputs considered may not occur at the same rate and \nmay not be consistent across all geographies or \nproduct types, and changes in factors and inputs may \nbe directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in \none factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate \nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the \nmodeled credit losses determined using its central \nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which \nare two of the five scenarios considered in estimating \nthe allowances for loan losses and lending-related \ncommitments. The central and relative adverse \nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but \ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of \nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario \nshown on page 137 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative \nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n161\nunemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1% \nhigher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak \ndifference of approximately 3.0% in the fourth quarter \nof 2025.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected \nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a \nnumber of reasons, including:\n• The allowance as of December 31, 2024, reflects \ncredit losses beyond those estimated under the \ncentral scenario due to the weight placed on the \nadverse scenarios.\n• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both \ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this \nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more \nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables. \n• Expectations of future changes in portfolio \ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly \naffect the allowance for credit losses.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates \nto macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2024, \nthe Firm compared the modeled estimates under its \nrelative adverse scenario to its central scenario. \nWithout considering offsetting or correlated effects in \nother qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance \nfor credit losses, the comparison between these two \nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the following \ndifferences:\n• An increase of approximately $850 million for \nresidential real estate loans and lending-related \ncommitments\n• An increase of approximately $3.7 billion for credit \ncard loans\n• An increase of approximately $4.1 billion for \nwholesale loans and lending-related commitments\nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss \nestimates and is not intended to estimate changes in \nthe overall allowance for credit losses as it does not \nreflect any potential changes in other adjustments to \nthe quantitative calculation, which would also be \ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to \nthe modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the \nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime \nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances \nand conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic \nconditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes \nthat its process to consider the available information \nand associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately \ngoverned and that its estimates of expected credit \nlosses were reasonable and appropriate for the period \nended December 31, 2024.\nFair value\nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and \nliabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and \nliabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring \nbasis, including derivatives, structured note products \nand certain securities financing agreements. Certain \nassets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a \nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home \nequity and other loans, where the carrying value is \nbased on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nAssets measured at fair value \nThe following table includes the Firm’s assets \nmeasured at fair value and the portion of such assets \nthat are classified within level 3 of the fair value \nhierarchy.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if \nnetting were applied, including the netting benefit associated \nwith cash collateral.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n162\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nValuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair \nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value \nrequires the application of judgment. The type and level \nof judgment required is largely dependent on the \namount of observable market information available to \nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally \ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation \ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs and \nare therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value \nhierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are \nmore significant than those required when estimating \nthe fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 \nand 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument \nwithin level 3, management must first determine the \nappropriate valuation model or other valuation \ntechnique to use. Second, the lack of observability of \ncertain significant inputs requires management to \nassess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation \ninputs including, for example, transaction details, yield \ncurves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default \nrates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as \ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of \ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and \ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of \nthe valuation of level 3 instruments, including \nunobservable inputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, \nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the \nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect \ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, \nmarket funding rates, liquidity considerations, \nunobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet \nspecified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. \nThe judgments made are typically affected by the type \nof product and its specific contractual terms, and the \nlevel of liquidity for the product or within the market as a \nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility and \nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider \nvariation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly \nfor positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a \nfurther discussion of valuation adjustments applied by \nthe Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs \nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss \nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while \nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate \nand consistent with those of other market participants, \nthe methods and assumptions used reflect \nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s \nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions \nin the determination of fair value. The use of \nmethodologies or assumptions different than those \nused by the Firm could result in a different estimate of \nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a \ndetailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and \nhierarchy, and its determination of fair value for \nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to \nreporting units and tested for impairment at least \nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to \nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in \nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing \ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with \neach business combination is allocated to the related \nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm \nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated \nmarket cost of equity, as well as actual business results \nand projections of business performance. Based on \nsuch reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was \nnot impaired as of December 31, 2024. For each of the \nreporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at \nleast 10% and there was no indication of a significant \nrisk of goodwill impairment based on current \nprojections and valuations. \nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are \nconsistent with management’s current business outlook \nassumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best \nestimates of long-term growth and return on equity in \nthe longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-\nparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and \nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, \nincluding the goodwill impairment assessment as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorganChase offers credit cards with various \nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn \nrewards points based on their account activity and the \nterms and conditions of the rewards program. \nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an \neligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, \nand the points can be redeemed for a variety of \nrewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of \naccount credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm \nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the \nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected \nto be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued \nas the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when \nthe cardholder redeems points. This liability was $14.4 \nbillion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and \nother liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The \nincrease in the liability was driven by continued growth \nin rewards points earned on higher spend and \npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout \n2024.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate \n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n163\nassumption is used to estimate the number of points \nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the life \nof the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate \nthe cost of future point redemptions. These \nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering \nhistorical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and \nmanagement judgment. Updates to these assumptions \nwill impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, \n2024, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and \n1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability \nby approximately $442 million.\nIncome taxes \nJPMorganChase is subject to the income tax laws of the \nvarious jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. \nfederal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. \nThese laws are often complex and may be subject to \ndifferent interpretations. To determine the financial \nstatement impact of accounting for income taxes, \nincluding the provision for income tax expense and \nunrecognized tax benefits, JPMorganChase must make \nassumptions and judgments about how to interpret and \napply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions \nand business events, as well as make judgments \nregarding the timing of when certain items may affect \ntaxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nJPMorganChase’s interpretations of tax laws around the \nworld are subject to review and examination by the \nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the \nFirm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its \nview on a tax position. These disputes over \ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities may \nbe settled by audit, administrative appeals or \nadjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions \nin which the Firm operates. JPMorganChase regularly \nreviews whether it may be assessed additional income \ntaxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and \nthe Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, \nas appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its \nestimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax \nlaws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is \npossible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income \ntaxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of \noperations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets \nand liabilities measured for financial reporting versus \nincome tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are \nrecognized if, in management’s judgment, their \nrealizability is determined to be more likely than not. \nDeferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates \nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in \nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be \nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a \nchange in tax rates is recognized within the provision \nfor income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in \nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net \noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax \ncredit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular \nreviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are \nrealizable. These reviews include management’s \nestimates and assumptions regarding future taxable \nincome, including foreign source income, and may \nincorporate various tax planning strategies, including \nstrategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and \nFTCs before they expire. In connection with these \nreviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is \nnot realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The \nvaluation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent \nreporting period if the Firm determines that, based on \nrevised estimates of future taxable income or changes \nin tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that \nall or part of the deferred tax asset will become \nrealizable. As of December 31, 2024, management has \ndetermined it is more likely than not that the Firm will \nrealize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing \nvaluation allowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as \nnecessary when new information becomes available, \nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and \ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax \npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not \nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the \namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit \nthat management believes is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the \nreassessment of JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax \nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective \nincome tax rate in the period in which the reassessment \noccurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates \nare reasonable, the final tax amount could be different \nfrom the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax \nprovisions and accruals. To the extent that the final \noutcome of these amounts is different than the amounts \nrecorded, such differences will generally impact the \nFirm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which \nsuch a determination is made.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of \ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred \ntax provisions are calculated based on estimates and \nassumptions that could differ from the actual results \nreflected in income tax returns filed during the \nsubsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns \nare generally recorded in the period when the tax \nreturns are filed and the global tax implications are \nknown, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income \ntaxes.\nLitigation reserves \nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant \nestimates and judgments associated with establishing \nlitigation reserves.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n164\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2024\nStandard\nSummary of guidance \nEffects on financial statements\nFair Value \nMeasurement: Fair \nValue Measurement \nof Equity Securities \nSubject to \nContractual Sale \nRestrictions\nIssued June 2022\n• Clarifies that a contractual sale restriction is \nnot considered part of the unit of account of \nthe equity security and, therefore, is not \nconsidered in measuring fair value.\n• Requires disclosure for investments in equity \nsecurities subject to contractual sale \nrestrictions, including: 1) fair value of these \ninvestments, 2) nature and remaining \nduration of the restriction(s) and 3) \ncircumstances that could cause a lapse in the \nrestriction(s).\n• Adopted prospectively on January 1, \n2024, with no impact to the Firm’s \nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestments - Equity \nMethod and Joint \nVentures: \nAccounting for \nInvestments in Tax \nCredit Structures \nUsing the \nProportional \nAmortization Method\nIssued March 2023\n• Expands the ability to elect proportional \namortization on a program-by-program \nbasis, for additional types of tax-oriented \ninvestments (beyond affordable housing tax \ncredit investments).\n• May be adopted using a full retrospective \nmethod, or a modified retrospective method \nwherein the effect of adoption is reflected as \nan adjustment to retained earnings at the \neffective date.\n• Adopted under the modified \nretrospective method on January 1, \n2024.\n• Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nSegment Reporting: \nImprovements to \nReportable Segment \nDisclosures\nIssued November \n2023\n• Requires disclosure of significant segment \nexpenses that are readily provided to the \nchief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and \nincluded in segment profit or loss.\n• Requires disclosure of the composition and \naggregate amount of other segment items, \nwhich represent the difference between \nprofit or loss and segment revenues less \nsignificant segment expenses.\n• Requires disclosure of the title and position \nof the CODM and an explanation of how the \nCODM uses the reported segment measures \nin assessing segment performance and \ndeciding how to allocate resources.\n• Adopted retrospectively for the Firm’s \nannual Consolidated Financial \nStatements for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024.\n(a)\n• The adoption of this guidance resulted \nin additional reportable segment \ndisclosures, primarily relating to \nsignificant segment expenses and the \nCODM.

Internal control over financial \nreporting is a process designed by, or under the \nsupervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and \nprincipal financial officers, or persons performing \nsimilar functions, and effected by JPMorganChase’s \nBoard of Directors, management and other personnel, \nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of \nfinancial statements for external purposes in \naccordance with accounting principles generally \naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nJPMorganChase’s internal control over financial \nreporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in \nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) \nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that \nreceipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made \nonly in accordance with authorizations of \nJPMorganChase’s management and directors; and (3) \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or \ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or \ndisposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of \neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk \nthat controls may become inadequate because of \nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance \nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nManagement has completed an assessment of the \neffectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial \nreporting as of December 31, 2024. In making the \nassessment, management used the “Internal Control — \nIntegrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by \nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management \nconcluded that as of December 31, 2024, \nJPMorganChase’s internal control over financial \nreporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 \nframework. Additionally, based upon management’s \nassessment, the Firm determined that there were no \nmaterial weaknesses in its internal control over financial \nreporting as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been \naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an \nindependent registered public accounting firm, as \nstated in their report which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJeremy Barnum\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 14, 2025 \nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\n168\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of \nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal \nControl over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated \nbalance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its \nsubsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023, and the related consolidated statements of \nincome, comprehensive income, changes in \nstockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three \nyears in the period ended December 31, 2024, including \nthe related notes (collectively referred to as the \n“consolidated financial statements”). We also have \naudited the Firm’s internal control over financial \nreporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements \nreferred to above present fairly, in all material respects, \nthe financial position of the Firm as of December 31, \n2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period \nended December 31, 2024 in conformity with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the United \nStates of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm \nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, \n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – \nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these \nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining \neffective internal control over financial reporting, and for \nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control \nover financial reporting, included in the accompanying \nManagement’s report on internal control over financial \nreporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on \nthe Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the \nFirm’s internal control over financial reporting based on \nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered \nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Firm in accordance with \nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the \nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that \nwe plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether the consolidated financial \nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether \ndue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all \nmaterial respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements \nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and \nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. \nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, \nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also \nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as \nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over \nfinancial reporting included obtaining an understanding \nof internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and \nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of \ninternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits \nalso included performing such other procedures as we \nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our \nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over \nFinancial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a \nprocess designed to provide reasonable assurance \nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the \npreparation of financial statements for external \npurposes in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly \nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of \nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that \ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that \nreceipts and expenditures of the company are being \nmade only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and \n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention \nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of \neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk \nthat controls may become inadequate because of \nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance \nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  •  300 Madison Avenue  •  New York, NY 10017\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n169\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are \nmatters arising from the current period audit of the \nconsolidated financial statements that were \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the \naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated \nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially \nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The \ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter \nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial \nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, \nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit \nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which \nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based \ncomponent of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan \nPortfolios \nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial \nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the \nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and \ncredit card loan portfolios was $22.0 billion on total \nportfolio-based retained loans of $919.3 billion at \nDecember 31, 2024. The Firm’s allowance for loan \nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected \ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the \nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future \nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan \nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan \nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of \nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the \nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated \nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are \ndetermined based on the weighted average of five \ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that \ntake into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as \nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, \nthe most significant of which are U.S. unemployment \nand U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative \ncalculation is further adjusted to take into \nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk \nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that \nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss \nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that \nperforming procedures relating to the allowance for \nloan losses for the portfolio-based component of the \nwholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical \naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and \nestimation by management in the forecast of \nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. \nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, \nas the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions \nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit \nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant \njudgment and estimation by management in \ndetermining the quantitative calculation utilized in \ntheir credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take \ninto consideration model imprecision, emerging risk \nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that \nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss \nestimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor \njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing \nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained \nrelating to the credit loss estimates and the \nappropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss \nestimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing \nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in \nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the \nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures \nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls relating \nto the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including \ncontrols over model validation and generation of \nmacroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also \nincluded, among others, testing management’s \nprocess for estimating the allowance for loan losses, \nwhich involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of \nthe models and methodologies used in quantitative \ncalculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of \nforecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross \ndomestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and \naccuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) \nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s \nadjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts \nof model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, \ntrends and other subjective factors that are not yet \notherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These \nprocedures also included the use of professionals with \nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating \nthe appropriateness of certain models, methodologies \nand macroeconomic variables.\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.5 trillion of its \nassets and $586.2 billion of its liabilities at fair value on \na recurring basis. Included in these balances are $10.9 \nbillion of trading assets and $51.8 billion of liabilities \nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively \nfinancial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as \nthey contain one or more inputs to valuation which are \nunobservable and significant to their fair value \nmeasurement. The Firm utilized internally developed \nvaluation models and unobservable inputs to estimate \nfair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The \nunobservable inputs used by management to estimate \nthe fair value of certain of these financial instruments \ninclude interest rate volatility, equity volatility, \nBermudan switch value and correlation relating to \ninterest rates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange, \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n170\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nequity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange and equity-\nto-interest rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that \nperforming procedures relating to the fair value of \ncertain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit \nmatter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation \nby management in determining the inputs to estimate \nfair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor \njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing \nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained \nrelated to the fair value of these financial instruments, \nand (ii) the audit effort involved the use of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing \nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in \nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the \nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures \nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls relating \nto the Firm’s determination of the fair value, including \ncontrols over models, inputs, and data. These \nprocedures also included, among others, the \ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill and \nknowledge to assist in developing an independent \nestimate of fair value for a sample of these financial \ninstruments and comparing management’s estimate \nto the independently developed estimate of fair value. \nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing \nthe completeness and accuracy of data provided by \nmanagement, developing independent inputs and, as \nappropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s \naforementioned unobservable inputs. \nNew York, New York\nFebruary 14, 2025\nWe have served as the Firm’s auditor since 1965."

(“JPMorganChase” or the \n“Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated \nunder Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial \nservices firm based in the U.S., with operations \nworldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, \nfinancial services for consumers and small businesses, \ncommercial banking, financial transaction processing \nand asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further \ndiscussion of the Firm's reportable business \nsegments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of \nJPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. \nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies \nconform to the accounting and reporting guidelines \nprescribed by regulatory authorities.\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the \naccounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in \nwhich the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All \nmaterial intercompany balances and transactions have \nbeen eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary \ncapacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase \nand are not included on the Consolidated balance \nsheets.\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling \nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating \nwhether the entity is a voting interest entity or a \nvariable interest entity. \nVoting interest entities\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient \nequity and provide the equity investors voting rights \nthat enable them to make significant decisions relating \nto the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, \nthe Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling \ninterest is primarily based on the amount of voting \nequity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a \ncontrolling financial interest, through ownership of the \nmajority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or \nthrough other contractual rights that give the Firm \ncontrol, are consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has \nsignificant influence over operating and financing \ndecisions (but does not own a majority of the voting \nequity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance \nwith the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair \nvalue if the fair value option was elected. These \ninvestments are generally included in other assets, \nwith income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are \nstructured as limited partnerships or limited liability \ncompanies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the \ngeneral partner or managing member, but the non-\naffiliated partners or members have the ability to \nremove the Firm as the general partner or managing \nmember without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on \na simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or \nmembers have rights to participate in important \ndecisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate \nthese voting interest entities. However, in the limited \ncases where the non-managing partners or members \ndo not have substantive kick-out or participating \nrights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and \nconsolidates the funds if the Firm is the general \npartner or managing member and has both power and \na potentially significant interest. \nThe Firm’s investment companies and asset \nmanagement funds have investments in both publicly-\nheld and privately-held entities, including investments \nin buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. \nThese investments are accounted for under \ninvestment company guidelines and, accordingly, \nirrespective of the percentage of equity ownership \ninterests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance \nsheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, \nwith income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If \nconsolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under \nsuch specialized investment company guidelines.\nVariable interest entities \nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack \nsufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its \nactivities without additional subordinated financial \nsupport from other parties, or (2) have equity investors \nthat do not have the ability to make significant \ndecisions relating to the entity’s operations through \nvoting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb \nthe expected losses, or do not have the right to receive \nthe residual returns of the entity.\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are \ncommonly used in securitization transactions in order \nto isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows \nfrom those assets to investors. The basic SPE \nstructure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; \nthe SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing \nsecurities to investors. The legal documents that \ngovern the transaction specify how the cash earned on \nthe assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors \nand other parties that have rights to those cash flows. \nSPEs are generally structured to insulate investors \nfrom claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other \nentities, including the creditors of the seller of the \nassets. \nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has \na controlling financial interest) is required to \nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n177\nprimary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the \npower to direct the activities of the VIE that most \nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; \nand (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation \nto absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from \nthe VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nTo assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the \nactivities of a VIE that most significantly impact the \nVIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all \nthe facts and circumstances, including its role in \nestablishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and \nresponsibilities. This assessment includes, first, \nidentifying the activities that most significantly impact \nthe VIE’s economic performance; and second, \nidentifying which party, if any, has power over those \nactivities. In general, the parties that make the most \nsignificant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset \nmanagers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of \ncall options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) \nor have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-\nmakers are deemed to have the power to direct the \nactivities of a VIE.\nTo assess whether the Firm has the obligation to \nabsorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits \nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the \nVIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, \nincluding debt and equity investments, servicing fees, \nand derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be \nvariable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires \nthat the Firm apply judgment in determining whether \nthese interests, in the aggregate, are considered \npotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in \nassessing significance include: the design of the VIE, \nincluding its capitalization structure; subordination of \ninterests; payment priority; relative share of interests \nheld across various classes within the VIE’s capital \nstructure; and the reasons why the interests are held \nby the Firm.\nThe Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) \nwhether entities previously evaluated under the \nmajority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, \nbased on certain events, and are therefore subject to \nthe VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether \nchanges in the facts and circumstances regarding the \nFirm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s \nconsolidation conclusion to change.\nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-\nsponsored VIEs.\nRevenue recognition \nInterest income \nThe Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt \nsecurities, and other debt instruments, generally on a \nlevel-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual \nrate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\nRevenue from contracts with customers \nJPMorganChase recognizes noninterest revenue from \ncertain contracts with customers, in investment \nbanking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management \nfees, commissions and other fees, and components of \ncard income, when the Firm’s related performance \nobligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further \ndiscussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with \ncustomers. \nPrincipal transactions revenue \nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and \nliabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are \nreported primarily in principal transactions revenue. \nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair \nvalue measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further \ndiscussion of principal transactions revenue. \nUse of estimates in the preparation of consolidated \nfinancial statements\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial \nStatements requires management to make estimates \nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of \nassets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and \ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual \nresults could be different from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation\nJPMorganChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue \nand expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into \nU.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.\nGains and losses relating to translating functional \ncurrency financial statements for U.S. reporting are \nincluded in the Consolidated statements of \ncomprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to \nnonfunctional currency transactions, including non-\nU.S. operations where the functional currency is the \nU.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated \nstatements of income.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative \nreceivables and derivative payables with the same \ncounterparty and the related cash collateral \nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the \nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally \nenforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. \nGAAP also permits securities sold and purchased \nunder repurchase agreements and securities \nborrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements \nto be presented net when specified conditions are met, \nincluding the existence of a legally enforceable master \nnetting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such \nbalances where it has determined that the specified \nconditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate \ncounterparty credit risk in certain transactions, \nincluding derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, \nsecurities borrowed and securities loaned \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n178\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nagreements. A master netting agreement is a single \nagreement with a counterparty that permits multiple \ntransactions governed by that agreement to be \nterminated or accelerated and settled through a single \npayment in a single currency in the event of a default \n(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment \nor securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin \nwhen due). Upon the exercise of derivatives \ntermination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all \ntransactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are \nvalued and the positive values of “in the money” \ntransactions are netted against the negative values of \n“out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only \nremaining payment obligation is of one of the parties \nto pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise \nof default rights under repurchase agreements and \nsecurities loan agreements in general (i) all \ntransactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all \nvalues of securities or cash held or to be delivered are \ncalculated, and all such sums are netted against each \nother and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is \nof one of the parties to pay the netted termination \namount.\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of \ntransactions also often contain a collateral/margin \nagreement that provides for a security interest in, or \ntitle transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to \nthe party that has the right to demand margin (the \n“demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement \ntypically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin \nto the demanding party with a value equal to the \namount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all \ntransactions governed by the master netting \nagreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin \nagreement grants to the demanding party, upon \ndefault by the counterparty, the right to set-off any \namounts payable by the counterparty against any \nposted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted \ncollateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding \nparty the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to \napply the proceeds to an amount payable by the \ncounterparty.\nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s \nderivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further \ndiscussion of the Firm’s securities financing \nagreements. \nStatements of cash flows\nFor JPMorganChase’s Consolidated statements of \ncash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included \nin cash and due from banks and deposits with banks \non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounting standard adopted January 1, 2024\nEquity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for \nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures Using the \nProportional Amortization Method \nThe guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented \ninvestments, beyond affordable housing tax credit \ninvestments, that the Firm can elect on a program by \nprogram basis, to be accounted for using the \nproportional amortization method. This method \nrequires the cost of eligible investments, within an \nelected program, to be amortized in proportion to the \ntax benefits received with the resulting amortization \nreported directly in income tax expense, which aligns \nwith the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. \nEligible investments must meet certain criteria, \nincluding that substantially all of the return is from \nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits.\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under \nthe modified retrospective method. The adoption of \nthis guidance resulted in a change to the classification \nand timing of the amortization associated with certain \nof the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented \ninvestments. As a result of the adoption, the \namortization of these investments that was previously \nrecognized in other income is now recognized in \nincome tax expense. The change in accounting \nresulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $161 \nmillion and increased the Firm’s income tax expense \nand the effective tax rate by approximately $450 \nmillion and two percentage points, respectively, in the \nfirst quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net \nincome.\nThe guidance requires additional disclosure for all \ninvestments that generate income tax credits and \nother income tax benefits from a tax-oriented \ninvestment program for which the Firm has elected to \napply the proportional amortization method. The \nguidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible \ninvestments when significant modifications or events \noccur that result in a change in the nature of the \ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship with \nthe underlying project.\nRefer to Notes 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2023\nDerivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – \nPortfolio Layer Method\nThe adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to \nhedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying \nhedge accounting relationship. As permitted by the \nguidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities \nto AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio \nlayer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption \nimpact of the transfer on retained earnings was not \nmaterial.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n179\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled \nDebt Restructurings (“TDRs”) \nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the \nrequirement to measure the allowance for TDRs using \na discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology and \nallowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based \napproach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. \nThe Firm elected this option for all portfolios of \nmodified loans to troubled borrowers except \ncollateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated \nloans, for which the Firm elected to continue applying \na DCF methodology. The adoption of this guidance \nunder the modified retrospective method on January 1, \n2023, resulted in a $446 million increase to retained \nearnings.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorganChase’s other \nsignificant accounting policies and the Note and page \nwhere a detailed description of each policy can be \nfound.\nFair value measurement\nNote 2\npage 181\nFair value option\nNote 3\npage 203\nDerivative instruments\nNote 5\npage 209\nNoninterest revenue and noninterest \nexpense\nNote 6\npage 225\nInterest income and Interest expense\nNote 7\npage 229\nPension and other postretirement \nemployee benefit plans\nNote 8\npage 230\nEmployee share-based incentives\nNote 9\npage 233\nInvestment securities\nNote 10\npage 235\nSecurities financing activities\nNote 11\npage 240\nLoans\nNote 12\npage 243\nAllowance for credit losses\nNote 13\npage 266\nVariable interest entities\nNote 14\npage 271\nGoodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and \nother intangible assets\nNote 15\npage 280\nPremises and equipment\nNote 16\npage 285\nLeases\nNote 18\npage 286\nAccounts payable & other liabilities\nNote 19\npage 288\nLong-term debt\nNote 20\npage 289\nEarnings per share\nNote 23\npage 294\nIncome taxes\nNote 25\npage 296\nOff–balance sheet lending-related \nfinancial instruments, guarantees and \nother commitments\nNote 28\npage 302\nLitigation\nNote 30\npage 309\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n180\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNote 2 – Fair value measurement\nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and \nliabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are \npredominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis \n(i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and \nreported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated \nbalance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and \nunfunded lending-related commitments are measured \nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are \nnot measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are \nsubject to fair value adjustments only in certain \ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of \nimpairment).\nFair value is defined as the price that would be \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \nan orderly transaction between market participants at \nthe measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted \nmarket prices or inputs, where available. If prices or \nquotes are not available, fair value is based on \nvaluation models and other valuation techniques that \nconsider relevant transaction characteristics (such as \nmaturity) and use, as inputs, observable or \nunobservable market parameters, including yield \ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as \ncommodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, \nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value \nmay also incorporate valuation adjustments. \nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable \nmarket inputs or other factors can affect the amount of \ngain or loss recorded for a particular position. \nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation \nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those of \nother market participants, the methods and \nassumptions used reflect management judgment and \nmay vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and \nassumptions in the determination of fair value. The use \nof different methodologies or assumptions by other \nmarket participants compared with those used by the \nFirm could result in the Firm deriving a different \nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. \nValuation process \nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair \nvalue estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the \nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s \nValuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the \nFirm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-\ntaking functions, is responsible for verifying these \nestimates and determining any fair value adjustments \nthat may be required to ensure that the Firm’s \npositions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the \nFirm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is \ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives, is \nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks \narising from valuation activities conducted across the \nFirm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide \nhead of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s \nController), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, \nCCB, AWM and certain corporate functions including \nTreasury and CIO. \nPrice verification process \nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the \nrisk-taking functions by leveraging independently \nderived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, \nwhere available. Where independent prices or inputs \nare not available, the VCG performs additional review \nto ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The \nadditional review may include evaluating the limited \nmarket activity including client unwinds, \nbenchmarking valuation inputs to those used for \nsimilar instruments, decomposing the valuation of \nstructured instruments into individual components, \ncomparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing \nprofit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in \ncollateral valuation. There are also additional levels of \nmanagement review for more significant or complex \npositions.\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that \nmay be required to the estimates provided by the risk-\ntaking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are \napplied for instruments classified within level 1 of the \nfair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion of the fair \nvalue hierarchy on page 182 for further information). \nFor other positions, judgment is required to assess the \nneed for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect \nliquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, \nand, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, \nthe size of the net open risk position. The \ndetermination of such adjustments follows a \nconsistent framework across the Firm:\n• Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered \nwhere an observable external price or valuation \nparameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially \ndue to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation \nadjustments are made based on current market \nconditions. Factors that may be considered in \ndetermining the liquidity adjustment include \nanalysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the \ninstrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing \npoints for similar instruments in active markets; and \n(3) the range of reasonable values that the price or \nparameter could take. \n• The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial \ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure \nand, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to \nestimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis \nof a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an \norderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation \nadjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of \nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open \nrisk position. Where applied, such adjustments are \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n181\nbased on factors that a relevant market participant \nwould consider in the transfer of the net open risk \nposition, including the size of the adverse market \nmove that is likely to occur during the period \nrequired to sufficiently reduce the net open risk \nposition. \n• Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable \nparameters may be made when positions are valued \nusing prices or input parameters to valuation models \nthat are unobservable due to a lack of market \nactivity or because they cannot be implied from \nobservable market data. Such prices or parameters \nmust be estimated and are, therefore, subject to \nmanagement judgment. Adjustments are made to \nreflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting \nvaluation estimate. \n• Where appropriate, the Firm also applies \nadjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to \nappropriately reflect counterparty credit quality \n(CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and \nthe impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent \nframework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and \nfunding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for \nmore information on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval \nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument \nor a similar instrument, fair value is generally \ndetermined using valuation models that consider \nrelevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as \ninputs market-based or independently sourced \nparameters. Where this is the case the price \nverification process described above is applied to the \ninputs in those models. \nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk \nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new \nmodels, as well as material changes to existing \nmodels, prior to implementation in the operating \nenvironment. In certain circumstances exceptions may \nbe granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be \nused prior to review or approval. MRGR may also \nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate \nthe model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These \nactions will depend on the model and may include, for \nexample, limitation of trading activity. \nFair value hierarchy \nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established \nunder U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value \nmeasurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on \nthe observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset \nor liability as of the measurement date.

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities \ninventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the \nFirm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying \nvalue of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in \nfair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure \ninformation, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n187\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short \npositions).\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not \nrequired to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include \ncertain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.0 billion, primarily reported in other assets.\n(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral \nreceived and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, \nincluding the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n188\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for \ndetermining fair value, including for instruments where \nfair value is estimated using significant unobservable \ninputs (level 3). Refer to pages 181–185 of this Note for \nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process and \na detailed discussion of the determination of fair value \nfor individual financial instruments. \nEstimating fair value requires the application of \njudgment. The type and level of judgment required is \nlargely dependent on the amount of observable market \ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments \nvalued using internally developed valuation models and \nother valuation techniques that use significant \nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within \nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to \nestimate fair value are more significant than those \nrequired when estimating the fair value of instruments \nclassified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument \nwithin level 3, management must first determine the \nappropriate valuation model or other valuation \ntechnique to use. Second, due to the lack of \nobservability of significant inputs, management must \nassess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation \ninputs including transaction details, yield curves, \ninterest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, \nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, \nequity or debt prices), valuations of comparable \ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 \nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to \nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, \nthe significant unobservable inputs, the range of values \nfor those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic \naverages of such inputs. While the determination to \nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the \nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall \nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments \ntypically include observable components (that is, \ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be \nvalidated to external sources) in addition to the \nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 \ninputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm \nmanages the risk of the observable components of level \n3 financial instruments using securities and derivative \npositions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is \nrepresentative of the highest and lowest level input \nused to value the significant groups of instruments \nwithin a product/instrument classification. Where \nprovided, the weighted averages of the input values \npresented in the table are calculated based on the fair \nvalue of the instruments that the input is being used to \nvalue. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and \narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of \ninput uncertainty or an assessment of the \nreasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and \nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of \nthe various instruments held by the Firm and the \nrelative distribution of instruments within the range of \ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may \nhave similar levels of market risk exposure and \nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly \ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option \ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike \nprices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic \naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the \ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at \neach balance sheet date. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n189\nLevel 3 inputs(a) \nDecember 31, 2024\nProduct/Instrument\nFair value \n(in millions)\nPrincipal valuation \ntechnique\nUnobservable inputs(g)\nRange of input values\nAverage(i)\nResidential mortgage-backed securities \nand loans\n(b)\n$ \n861 \nDiscounted cash flows\nYield\n0%\n103%\n8%\nPrepayment speed\n3%\n13%\n8%\nConditional default rate\n0%\n7%\n0%\nLoss severity\n0%\n110%\n5%\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities \nand loans\n(c)"

The impact of changes in \ninputs may not be independent, as a change in one \nunobservable input may give rise to a change in another \nunobservable input. Where relationships do exist \nbetween two unobservable inputs, those relationships \nare discussed below. Relationships may also exist \nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for \nexample, as observable interest rates rise, \nunobservable prepayment rates decline); such \nrelationships have not been included in the discussion \nbelow. In addition, for each of the individual \nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship \nwould also generally apply. \nThe following discussion also provides a description of \nattributes of the underlying instruments and external \nmarket factors that affect the range of inputs used in \nthe valuation of the Firm’s positions. \nYield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to \ndiscount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow \ncalculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would \nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nCredit spread – The credit spread is the amount of \nadditional annualized return over the market interest \nrate that a market participant would demand for taking \nexposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit \nspread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate \nused in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, \nan increase in the credit spread would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular \nmortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk \ninherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by \nthe absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument \n(which may not correspond directly to the level of \ninherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit \nspreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various \ninstruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in \nmortgage-backed securities is driven by the \nsubordination of the security being valued and the \ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the \ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, \nLTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of \nthe property and/or any tenants for commercial \nmortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of \nU.S. states and municipalities and other similar \ninstruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of \nthe obligor and the tenor of the obligation. \nPrepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a \nmeasure of the voluntary unscheduled principal \nrepayments of a prepayable obligation in a \ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally \ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in \nprepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued \nat a premium to par and an increase in a fair value \nmeasurement of assets valued at a discount to par. \nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to \ncollateral pool, and are driven by the type and location \nof the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of \nthe obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or \nfloating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. \nTypically collateral pools with higher borrower credit \nquality have a higher prepayment rate than those with \nlower borrower credit quality, all other factors being \nequal. \nConditional default rate – The conditional default rate is \na measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral \nbalance underlying a collateralized obligation as a \nresult of defaults. While there is typically no direct \nrelationship between conditional default rates and \nprepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which \nthe underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds \nwill tend to have lower conditional default rates. An \nincrease in conditional default rates would generally be \naccompanied by an increase in loss severity and an \nincrease in credit spreads. An increase in the \nconditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional \ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral \nunderlying a securitization and the structure of the \nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities \nowned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, \nconditional default rates are most typically at the lower \nend of the range presented. \nLoss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is \nthe recovery rate) is the expected amount of future \nrealized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of \na particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss \nrelative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in \nloss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in \nconditional default rates. An increase in the loss \nseverity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair \nvalue measurement. \nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed \nsecurity depends on factors relating to the underlying \nmortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the \nlender’s lien on the property and other instrument-\nspecific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n191\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the \nrelationship between the movements of two variables. \nCorrelation is a pricing input for a derivative product \nwhere the payoff is driven by one or more underlying \nrisks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of \nderivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign \nexchange and commodity) due to the nature of the \nunderlying risks. When parameters are positively \ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an \nincrease in the other parameter. When parameters are \nnegatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will \nresult in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase \nin correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a \nfair value measurement. Given a short correlation \nposition, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would \ngenerally result in a decrease in a fair value \nmeasurement.\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of \nderivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a \nnumber of factors including the nature of those risks. \nFor example, the correlation between two credit risk \nexposures would be different than that between two \ninterest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the \ntransaction may also impact the correlation input, as \nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be \ndifferent over different time periods. Furthermore, \ncorrelation levels are dependent on market conditions \nand could have a relatively wide range of levels within or \nacross asset classes over time, particularly in volatile \nmarket conditions. \nVolatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in \npossible returns for an instrument, parameter or market \nindex given how much the particular instrument, \nparameter or index changes in value over time. \nVolatility is a pricing input for options, including equity \noptions, commodity options, and interest rate options. \nGiven a long position in an option, an increase in \nvolatility, in isolation, would generally result in an \nincrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular \noption-based derivative depends on a number of \nfactors, including the nature of the risk underlying the \noption (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security \nmay be significantly different from that of a particular \ncommodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as \nthe strike price of the option. \nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the \ndifference between the overall value of a Bermudan \nswaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in \ntime, and its most expensive European swaption and \nreflects the additional value that the multiple exercise \ndates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent \non market conditions and can vary greatly depending \non a number of factors, such as the tenor of the \nunderlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. \nAn increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally \nresult in an increase in a fair value measurement.\nInterest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents \nthe relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. \nThe interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and \nforeign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a \npricing input used in the discounting of any derivative \ncash flow.  \nForward price – The forward price is the price at which \nthe buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a \nforward contract on the predetermined future delivery \ndate, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at \ninception. \nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of \ncertain derivatives and depends on a number of factors \nincluding interest rates, the current price of the \nunderlying asset, and the expected income to be \nreceived and costs to be incurred by the seller as a \nresult of holding that asset until the delivery date. An \nincrease in the forward can result in an increase or a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement. \nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements \nThe following tables include a rollforward of the \nConsolidated balance sheets amounts (including \nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified \nby the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for \nthe years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nWhen a determination is made to classify a financial \ninstrument within level 3, the determination is based on \nthe significance of the unobservable inputs to the \noverall fair value measurement. However, level 3 \nfinancial instruments typically include, in addition to the \nunobservable or level 3 components, observable \ncomponents (that is, components that are actively \nquoted and can be validated to external sources); \naccordingly, the gains and losses in the table below \ninclude changes in fair value due in part to observable \nfactors that are part of the valuation methodology. The \nFirm risk-manages the observable components of level \n3 financial instruments using securities and derivative \npositions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk \nmanagement instruments are not included below, the \ngains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the \neffect of the Firm’s risk management activities related \nto such level 3 instruments.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n192\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nFair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in millions)\nFair value \nat Jan. 1, \n2024\nTotal \nrealized/\nunrealized \ngains/\n(losses)\nTransfers \ninto\n  level 3\nTransfers \n(out of) \nlevel 3\nFair \nvalue at \nDec. 31, \n2024\nChange in \nunrealized gains/\n(losses) related \nto financial \ninstruments held \nat Dec. 31, 2024\nPurchases\n(g)\nSales\nSettlements\n(h)\nAssets:\n(a)\nFederal funds sold and securities \npurchased under resale agreements\n$ \n— $ \n— \n$ \n— $ \n— \n$ \n— $ \n— $ \n— $ \n— \n$ \n— \nTrading assets:\nDebt instruments:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nU.S. GSEs and government \nagencies"

These \nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors \nsuch as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s \nown credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is \ngenerally necessary to make adjustments to the base \nestimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the \nrelevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect \ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm \nestimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate \nthe expected positive credit exposure across all of the \nFirm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and \nthen estimates losses based on the probability of \ndefault and estimated recovery rate as a result of a \ncounterparty credit event considering contractual \nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit \nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. \nThe key inputs to this methodology are (i) the \nprobability of a default event occurring for each \ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated \nCDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied \nby CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences \nin recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to \nthose reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect \nsenior unsecured creditor risk.\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of \nfunding and is recognized where there is evidence that \na market participant in the principal market would \nincorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The \nFirm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized \n(including partially collateralized) over-the-counter \n(“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) \nthe expected funding requirements arising from the \nFirm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral \narrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding \ncost in the principal market which, for derivative \nliabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For \ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by \ndiscounting expected future cash flows at the relevant \novernight indexed swap rate given the underlying \ncollateral agreement with the counterparty, and \ntherefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and \nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue \nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any \nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented \nbelow includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit \nquality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the \nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over \ntime.\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA\n$ \n29 \n$ \n221 \n$ \n22 \nDerivatives FVA"

As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had \ndisposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales in the second and third quarters of 2024  and through a $1.0 billion \ncontribution to the Firm’s Foundation in the second quarter of 2024. \nThe Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares \n(“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The \nconversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was  1.5430 at December 31, 2024  and may be adjusted by Visa \ndepending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect \nthat the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, \n2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated \nand what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as \ndifferences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their \nnominal carryover basis. \nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments \nwith the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion \nrate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent \nchanges in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The \npayments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B-2 shares associated with the \npreviously sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at \nfair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of \nfinal resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in \nfair value are recognized in other income. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative \ninstruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm held \nderivative instruments associated with 11.6 million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which \nare all subject to similar terms and conditions. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n200\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of \nfinancial instruments that are not carried on the \nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value \nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair \nvalue of certain financial instruments, which are \nincluded in the following table. However, this table \ndoes not include other items, such as nonfinancial \nassets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, \nand customer relationships. In the opinion of \nmanagement, these items, in the aggregate, add \nsignificant value to JPMorganChase.\nFinancial instruments for which carrying value \napproximates fair value \nCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair \nvalue on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried \nat amounts that approximate fair value, due to their \nshort-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. \nThese instruments include cash and due from banks, \ndeposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities \npurchased under resale agreements and securities \nborrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest \nreceivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds \npurchased, securities loaned and sold under \nrepurchase agreements, accounts payable, and \naccrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that \nthe fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated \nmaturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money \nmarket deposits) be equal to their carrying value; \nrecognition of the inherent funding value of these \ninstruments is not permitted. \nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at \nfair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy. \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated fair value hierarchy\nEstimated fair value hierarchy\n(in billions)\nCarrying \nvalue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal \nestimated \nfair value\nCarrying \nvalue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal \nestimated \nfair value\nFinancial assets\nCash and due from banks\n$ \n23.4 $ \n23.4 $ \n— $ \n— $ \n23.4 \n$ \n29.1 $ \n29.1 \n$ \n— \n$ \n— $ \n29.1 \nDeposits with banks"

For \nfixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes \nin value for the period is made between those \nchanges in value that are interest rate-related and \nchanges in value that are credit-related. Allocations \nare generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, \nwhere available, or benchmarking to similar entities \nor industries. \n• Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to \ninstrument-specific credit risk were derived \nprincipally from observable changes in the Firm’s \ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. \n• Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these \ntypes of agreements, there is a requirement that \ncollateral be maintained with a market value equal to \nor in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a \nresult, there would be no adjustment or an \nimmaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit \nrisk related to these agreements. \nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding \nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining \ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for loans, long-term debt and long-\nterm beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. \n2024\n2023\nDecember 31, (in millions)\nContractual \nprincipal \noutstanding\nFair value\nFair value over/\n(under) \ncontractual \nprincipal \noutstanding\nContractual \nprincipal \noutstanding\nFair value\nFair value \nover/(under) \ncontractual \nprincipal \noutstanding\nLoans\nNonaccrual loans\nLoans reported as trading assets\n$ \n3,429 \n$ \n464 $ \n(2,965) $ \n2,987 \n$ \n588 $ \n(2,399) \nLoans"

JPMorganChase \nmakes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses \nderivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. \nPredominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered \ninto for market-making or risk management purposes. \nMarket-making derivatives \nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into \nfor market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to \nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign \nexchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm \nactively manages the risks from its exposure to these \nderivatives by entering into other derivative contracts \nor by purchasing or selling other financial instruments \nthat partially or fully offset the exposure from client \nderivatives. \nRisk management derivatives \nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk \nexposures using derivative instruments, including \nderivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other \nderivatives that are used to manage risks associated \nwith specified assets and liabilities. \nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to \nmanage the risk associated with changes in interest \nrates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or \ndepreciate in market value as interest rates change. \nSimilarly, interest income and expense increase or \ndecrease as a result of variable-rate assets and \nliabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a \nresult of the repayment and subsequent origination or \nissuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current \nmarket rates. Gains and losses on the derivative \ninstruments related to these assets and liabilities are \nexpected to substantially offset this variability. \nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the \nforeign exchange risk associated with certain foreign \ncurrency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and \nliabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the \nFirm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries \nor branches whose functional currencies are not the \nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign \ncurrencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the \nforeign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or \nthe forecasted revenues or expenses increase or \ndecrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments \nrelated to these foreign currency–denominated assets \nor liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to \nsubstantially offset this variability. \nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price \nrisk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses \non these derivative instruments are expected to \nsubstantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of \nthe related inventory. \nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty \ncredit risk associated with loans and lending-related \ncommitments. Credit derivatives compensate the \npurchaser when the entity referenced in the contract \nexperiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a \nfailure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives \nprimarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives \nsection on pages 222–224 of this Note for a further \ndiscussion of credit derivatives. \nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and \nlosses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting \ngains and losses tables on pages 218–221 of this Note \nfor more information about risk management \nderivatives. \nDerivative counterparties and settlement types \nThe Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are \nnegotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative \ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, \ncertain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts \nare generally standardized contracts traded on an \nexchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s \ncounterparty from the inception of the transactions. \nOTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis \nand then novated to the CCP for clearing. \nDerivative clearing services \nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which \nthe Firm acts as a clearing member at certain \nexchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not \nreflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its \nConsolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for \nfurther information on the Firm’s clearing services. \nAccounting for derivatives \nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for \nits own account are required to be recorded on the \nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. \nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative \nassets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral \nreceivables and payables, when a legally enforceable \nmaster netting agreement exists between the Firm and \nthe derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further \ndiscussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The \naccounting for changes in value of a derivative depends \non whether or not the transaction has been designated \nand qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are \nnot designated as hedges are reported and measured \nat fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures \non pages 213–221 of this Note provide additional \ninformation on the amount of, and reporting for, \nderivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to \nNotes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives \nembedded in structured notes. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n209\nDerivatives designated as hedges \nThe Firm applies hedge accounting to certain \nderivatives executed for risk management purposes – \ngenerally interest rate, foreign exchange and \ncommodity derivatives. However, JPMorganChase \ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the \nderivatives associated with the Firm’s risk \nmanagement activities. For example, the Firm does \nnot apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to \nmanage the credit risk of loans and lending-related \ncommitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying \nsuch contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the \nFirm does not apply hedge accounting to certain \ninterest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity \nderivatives used for risk management purposes.  \nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be \nhighly effective at reducing the risk associated with the \nexposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to \nbe designated as a hedge, the risk management \nobjective and strategy must be documented. Hedge \ndocumentation must identify the derivative hedging \ninstrument, the asset or liability or forecasted \ntransaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the \neffectiveness of the derivative is assessed \nprospectively and retrospectively. To assess \neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such \nas regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as \ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair \nvalue of the derivative to the change in the fair value or \ncash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative \ncomparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any \nchanges in those terms. The extent to which a \nderivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, \nhighly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value \nor cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed \nand documented at least quarterly. If it is determined \nthat a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the \ndesignated exposure, hedge accounting is \ndiscontinued. \nThere are three types of hedge accounting \ndesignations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and \nnet investment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair \nvalue hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term \ndebt, AFS securities and certain commodities \ninventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the \nchanges in the fair value of the derivative, and in the \nvalue of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are \nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded \nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in \nOCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the \nderivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then \nthe adjustment to the hedged item continues to be \nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, \nfor interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized \nto earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts \naffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the \nclassification of the hedged item – primarily net \ninterest income and principal transactions revenue. \nThe Firm employs the portfolio layer method to \nmanage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate \nassets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis \nadjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and \nare only allocated to individual assets under certain \ncircumstances. These include instances where the \nportfolio amount falls below the hedged layer \namounts, or in cases of voluntary de-designation.\nJPMorganChase uses cash flow hedges primarily to \nhedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash \nflows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and \nforeign currency–denominated revenue and expense. \nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair \nvalue of the derivative are recorded in OCI and \nrecognized in earnings as the hedged item affects \nearnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are \nrecognized consistent with the classification of the \nhedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net \ninterest income and compensation expense. If the \nhedge relationship is terminated, then the change in \nvalue of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized \nin earnings when the cash flows that were hedged \naffect earnings. For hedge relationships that are \ndiscontinued because a forecasted transaction is \nexpected to not occur according to the original hedge \nforecast, any related derivative values recorded in \nAOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. \nJPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to \nprotect the value of the Firm’s net investments in \ncertain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose \nfunctional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For \nqualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair \nvalue of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign \nexchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation \nadjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment \nof effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n210\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or \ndisclosure category.\nType of Derivative\nUse of Derivative\nDesignation and \ndisclosure\nAffected \nsegment or \nunit\nPage \nreference\nManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\n• Interest rate\nHedge fixed rate assets and liabilities\nFair value hedge\nCorporate\n218-219\n• Interest rate\nHedge floating-rate assets and liabilities\nCash flow hedge\nCorporate\n220\n• Foreign exchange \nHedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities\nFair value hedge\nCorporate\n218-219\n• Foreign exchange \nHedge foreign currency-denominated forecasted revenue and \nexpense\nCash flow hedge\nCorporate\n220\n• Foreign exchange \nHedge the value of the Firm’s investments in non-U.S. dollar \nfunctional currency entities\nNet investment \nhedge\nCorporate\n221\n• Commodity \nHedge commodity inventory\nFair value hedge\nCIB, AWM\n218-219\nManage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\n• Interest rate\nManage the risk associated with mortgage commitments, \nwarehouse loans and MSRs\nSpecified risk \nmanagement\nCCB\n221\n• Credit\nManage the credit risk associated with wholesale lending exposures\nSpecified risk \nmanagement\nCIB, AWM\n221\n• Interest rate and \nforeign exchange\nManage the risk associated with certain other specified assets and \nliabilities\nSpecified risk \nmanagement\nCorporate, CIB\n221\nMarket-making derivatives and other activities:\n• Various\nMarket-making and related risk management\nMarket-making and \nother\nCIB\n221\n• Various\nOther derivatives\nMarket-making and \nother\nCIB, AWM, \nCorporate\n221\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n211\nNotional amount of derivative contracts \nThe following table summarizes the notional amount of \nfree-standing derivative contracts outstanding as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNotional amounts(b)\nDecember 31, (in billions)\n2024\n2023\nInterest rate contracts\nSwaps\n$ \n20,437 \n$ \n23,251 \nFutures and forwards"

All derivatives not included in the hedge \naccounting or specified risk management categories \nabove are included in this category. Gains and losses \non these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal \ntransactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information \non principal transactions revenue. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n221\nCredit derivatives \nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose \nvalue is derived from the credit risk associated with \nthe debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) \nand which allow one party (the protection purchaser) \nto transfer that risk to another party (the protection \nseller). Credit derivatives expose the protection \npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection \nseller, as the protection seller is required to make \npayments under the contract when the reference \nentity experiences a credit event, such as a \nbankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a \nrestructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a \npremium for providing protection but has the risk that \nthe underlying instrument referenced in the contract \nwill be subject to a credit event. \nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in \nthe credit derivatives market and uses these \nderivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its \ncapacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively \nmanages a portfolio of credit derivatives by \npurchasing and selling credit protection, \npredominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet \nthe needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the \nFirm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk \nassociated with lending exposures (loans and \nunfunded commitments) in its wholesale and \nconsumer businesses and derivatives counterparty \nexposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage \nthe credit risk arising from certain financial \ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. \nFollowing is a summary of various types of credit \nderivatives. \nCredit default swaps \nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a \nsingle reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based \nindex or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells \nprotection on both single- name and index-reference \nobligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS \ncontracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative \ncontracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the \ndefault risk of a single reference entity, while index \nCDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk \nassociated with the broader credit markets or credit \nmarket segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market \nindices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS \nacross many reference entities. New series of CDS \nindices are periodically established with a new \nunderlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect \nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference \nentities in the index experiences a credit event, then \nthe reference entity that defaulted is removed from the \nindex. CDS can also be referenced against specific \nportfolios of reference names or against customized \nexposure levels: for example, to provide protection \nagainst the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a \n$10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are \ncommonly known as tranche CDS. \nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS \ncontracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under \nthe terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS \ncontract has recourse to the reference entity. The \nprotection purchaser has recourse to the protection \nseller for the difference between the face value of the \nCDS contract and the fair value of the reference \nobligation at settlement of the credit derivative \ncontract, also known as the recovery value. The \nprotection purchaser does not need to hold the debt \ninstrument of the underlying reference entity in order \nto receive amounts due under the CDS contract when \na credit event occurs. \nCredit-related notes \nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a \ncredit risk component where the issuer of the credit-\nrelated note purchases from the note investor credit \nprotection on a reference entity or an index. Under the \ncontract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of \nthe note at the inception of the transaction, and in \nreturn, the issuer makes periodic payments to the \ninvestor, based on the credit risk of the referenced \nentity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value \nof the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or \none of the entities that makes up a reference index) \nexperiences a specified credit event. If a credit event \noccurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par \nvalue of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the \ninvestor the difference between the par value of the \nnote and the fair value of the defaulted reference \nobligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to \nthe credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting \nreference entity.\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional \namounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes \nthe Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 \nand 2023. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of \nprotection would typically pay out a percentage of the \nfull notional amount of net protection sold, as the \namount actually required to be paid on the contracts \ntakes into account the recovery value of the reference \nobligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages \nthe credit risk on contracts to sell protection by \npurchasing protection with identical or similar \nunderlying reference entities. Other purchased \nprotection referenced in the following tables includes \ncredit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, \nreference positions (including indices, portfolio \ncoverage and other reference points) as well as \nprotection purchased by CIB through credit-related \nnotes. Other purchased protection also includes credit \nprotection against certain loans in the retained lending \nportfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and \ncredit-related notes. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n222\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such \nderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit \nevent, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of \nwhich reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives. \nTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notes\nMaximum payout/Notional amount\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in millions)\nProtection sold\nProtection purchased \nwith identical \nunderlyings(c)\nNet protection \n(sold)/\npurchased(d)\nOther protection \npurchased(e)\nCredit derivatives\nCredit default swaps\n$ \n(450,184) \n$ \n474,554 \n$ \n24,370 \n$ \n6,858 \nOther credit derivatives(a)"

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, \n2024, 81 million shares of common stock were \navailable for issuance through May 2028. The LTIP is \nthe only active plan under which the Firm is currently \ngranting share-based incentive awards. In the \nfollowing discussion, the LTIP constitutes the Firm’s \nshare-based incentive plans. \nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon \ntheir grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and \nvest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after \nthree years and are converted into shares of common \nstock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically \ninclude full-career eligibility provisions, which allow \nemployees to continue to vest upon voluntary \ntermination based on age and/or service-related \nrequirements, subject to post-employment and other \nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture \nuntil vested and contain clawback provisions that may \nresult in cancellation under certain specified \ncircumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the \nrecipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any \ndividends paid on the underlying common stock \nduring the period the RSUs are outstanding. \nPerformance share units (“PSUs”) are granted \nannually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of \nDirectors, to members of the Firm’s Operating \nCommittee under the variable compensation program. \nPSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of \nspecified performance criteria over a three-year \nperiod. The number of awards that vest can range from \nzero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, \ndividends that accrue during the vesting period are \nreinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs \nand the related dividend equivalent share units are \nconverted into shares of common stock after vesting.\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units \nhave vested, the shares of common stock that are \ndelivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be \nretained for an additional holding period, for a total \ncombined vesting and holding period of approximately \nfive to eight years from the grant date depending on \nregulations in certain countries. \nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)  \nwere granted with an exercise price equal to the fair \nvalue of JPMorganChase’s common stock on the grant \ndate. SARs expire ten years after the grant date. There \nwere no grants of SARs in 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation \nexpense for each tranche of each award, net of \nestimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award \nwith its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche \ngranted, compensation expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting \ndate of the respective tranche, provided that the \nemployees will not become full-career eligible during \nthe vesting period. For awards with full-career \neligibility provisions and awards granted with no future \nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the \nestimated value of awards expected to be awarded to \nemployees as of the grant date without giving \nconsideration to the impact of post-employment \nrestrictions. For each tranche granted to employees \nwho will become full-career eligible during the vesting \nperiod, compensation expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier \nof the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the \nvesting date of the respective tranche. \nThe Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of \nemployee share-based incentive awards is to issue \neither new shares of common stock or treasury shares. \nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its \nemployee share-based awards by issuing treasury \nshares. \nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the \nclassification of share-based awards for purposes of \ncalculating earnings per share.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n233\nRSUs, PSUs and SARs activity \nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied \nby the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation \nmodel. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously.

In these circumstances the impairment loss is \nrecognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in \nthe Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to \nthe full difference between the amortized cost (net of \nallowance if applicable) and the fair value of the \nsecurity. \nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the \nintent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated \nto determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined \nthat a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an \nallowance for credit losses through the provision for \ncredit losses in the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome, limited by the amount of impairment. Any \nimpairment on debt securities that the Firm has the \nintent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is \nrecorded in OCI. \nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include \nadverse conditions specifically related to the industry, \ngeographic area or financial condition of the issuer or \nunderlying collateral of a security; and payment \nstructure of the security. \nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization \nfor credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows \nconsidering relevant market and economic data, \nunderlying loan-level data, and structural features of \nthe securitization, such as subordination, excess \nspread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit \nenhancement, and compares the losses projected for \nthe underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the \nlevel of credit enhancement in the securitization \nstructure to determine whether these features are \nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit \nloss exists. \nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated \nbelow “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be \ncontractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a \nway that the Firm would not recover substantially all of \nits recorded investment, the Firm evaluates \nimpairment for credit losses when there is an adverse \nchange in expected cash flows. \nHTM securities – credit risk\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities \nrepresents expected credit losses over the remaining \nexpected life of the securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of \nU.S. states and municipalities and commercial \nmortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying \nstatistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) \nto the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are \nderived using a weighted average of five internally \ndeveloped eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, \nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to \nrevert to long run historical information for periods \nbeyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further \ninformation on the eight-quarter macroeconomic \nforecast. \nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized \nloan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed \nsecurities is calculated as the difference between the \namortized cost and the present value of the cash flows \nexpected to be collected, discounted at the security’s \neffective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are \ndeveloped based on expectations of underlying \ncollateral performance derived using the eight-quarter \nmacroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as considering the structural \nfeatures of the security. \nThe application of different inputs and assumptions \ninto the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is \nsubject to significant management judgment, and \nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or \nconsidering other inputs or assumptions, could affect \nthe estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM \nsecurities. \nCredit quality indicator\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities \nis the risk rating assigned to each security. At both \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, all HTM securities were \nrated investment grade and were current and \naccruing, with approximately 99% rated at least AA+ \n(based upon external ratings where available, and \nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal risk \nratings).\nAllowance for credit losses on investment securities\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities was $152 million, $128 million and \n$96 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \nrespectively, which included a cumulative-effect \nadjustment to retained earnings related to the transfer \nof HTM securities to AFS for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023.\nSelected impacts of investment securities on the \nConsolidated statements of income\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRealized gains\n$ 593 \n$ \n622 \n$ \n198 \nRealized losses\n (1,614)  (3,802)  (2,578) \nInvestment securities losses\n$ (1,021) $ (3,180) $ (2,380)\nProvision for credit losses\n$ \n24 \n$ \n38 \n$ \n54 \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n238\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nContractual maturities and yields \nThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at December 31, 2024, of JPMorganChase’s \ninvestment securities portfolio by contractual maturity. \nBy remaining maturity\nDecember 31, 2024 (in millions)\nDue in one \nyear or less\nDue after one year \nthrough five years\nDue after five years \nthrough 10 years\nDue after \n10 years\n(c)\nTotal\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nAmortized cost\n$ \n132 \n$ \n9,410 \n$ \n4,059 \n$ \n91,027 \n$ \n104,628 \nFair value"

Where appropriate under applicable \naccounting guidance, securities financing agreements \nwith the same counterparty are reported on a net \nbasis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the \noffsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and \npaid in connection with securities financing \nagreements are recorded over the life of the \nagreement in interest income and interest expense on \nthe Consolidated statements of income. \nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain \nsecurities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for \nfurther information regarding the fair value option. The \nsecurities financing agreements for which the fair \nvalue option has been elected are reported within \nsecurities purchased under resale agreements, \nsecurities loaned or sold under repurchase \nagreements, and securities borrowed on the \nConsolidated balance sheets. Generally, for \nagreements carried at fair value, current-period \ninterest accruals are recorded within interest income \nand interest expense, with changes in fair value \nreported in principal transactions revenue. However, \nfor financial instruments containing embedded \nderivatives that would be separately accounted for in \naccordance with accounting guidance for hybrid \ninstruments, all changes in fair value, including any \ninterest elements, are reported in principal \ntransactions revenue. \nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the \nfair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a \nresult of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices \ndescribed below, the Firm did not hold any allowance \nfor credit losses with respect to resale and securities \nborrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023.\nCredit risk mitigation practices\nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm \nprimarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these \nrisks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying \nsecurities (predominantly high-quality securities \ncollateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. \nGSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has \nreceived from or provided to its counterparties \ncompared to the value of cash proceeds and \nexchanged collateral, and either requests additional \ncollateral or returns securities or collateral when \nappropriate. Margin levels are initially established \nbased upon the counterparty, the type of underlying \nsecurities, and the permissible collateral, and are \nmonitored on an ongoing basis. \nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the \nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the \nvalue of the securities received is less than initial cash \nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts \nexchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned \nagreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent \nthat the value of underlying securities advanced \nexceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, \nand any collateral amounts exchanged. \nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master \nnetting agreements and other similar arrangements \nwith its counterparties, which provide for the right to \nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral \namounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty \ndefault. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, \nwhere possible, of the securities underlying resale and \nsecurities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for \nfurther information regarding assets pledged and \ncollateral received in securities financing agreements.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n240\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net \namounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, \nas of December 31, 2024 and 2023. When the Firm has \nobtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a \nmaster netting agreement with a counterparty and \nwhere other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP \nare met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance \nsheets, the balances outstanding under its securities \nfinancing agreements with the same counterparty. In \naddition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash \ncollateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic \nexposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is \nnot eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet \npresentation.

The Firm accounts for loans \nbased on the following categories:\n• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment \n(i.e., “retained”)\n• Loans held-for-sale\n• Loans at fair value\nThe following provides a detailed accounting \ndiscussion of the Firm’s loans by category:\nLoans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, \nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, \nreflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the \nfollowing: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, \npremiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; \nand foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include \nbilled finance charges and fees.\nInterest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-\ninvestment is accrued and recognized as interest \nincome at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase \nprice discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred \nloan fees or costs, are recognized in interest income \nover the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of \nyield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including \naccrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in \naccrued interest and accounts receivables on the \nConsolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, \naccrued interest once billed is then recognized in the \nloan balances, with the related allowance recorded in \nthe allowance for credit losses. Changes in the \nallowance for credit losses on accrued interest on \ncredit card loans are recognized in the provision for \ncredit losses and charge-offs are recognized by \nreversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm \ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit \nlosses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with \nits policy to write them off no later than 90 days past \ndue by reversing interest income. \nNonaccrual loans \nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of \ninterest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit \ncard loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. \ngovernment agencies) are placed on nonaccrual \nstatus and considered nonperforming when full \npayment of principal and interest is not expected, \nregardless of delinquency status, or when principal \nand interest has been in default for a period of 90 days \nor more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the \nprocess of collection. A loan is determined to be past \ndue when the minimum payment is not received from \nthe borrower by the contractually specified due date or \nfor certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), \nwhen a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 \ndays or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are \ntypically maintained on nonaccrual status. \nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all \ninterest accrued but not collected is reversed against \ninterest income. In addition, the amortization of \ndeferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on \nnonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest \npayments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the \nrecorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; \nhowever, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate \ncollectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest \ncash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value \nof the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer \nloans, application of this policy typically results in the \nFirm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual \nconsumer loans on a cash basis.\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when \nrepayment is reasonably assured and there has been \ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the \nloan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured \nloan. \nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans \nare generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual \nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit \ncard loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged \noff or paid in full. \nAllowance for loan losses \nThe allowance for loan losses represents the \nestimated expected credit losses in the held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date \nand is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra \nasset, which brings the amortized cost to the net \ncarrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan \nlosses resulting from lending-related activity, \nmacroeconomic variables, changes in credit and other \ninputs are recorded in the provision for credit losses \non the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. \nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s \naccounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. \nCharge-offs \nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged \ndown to the lower of the amortized cost or the net \nrealizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair \nvalue less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the \nallowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified \nstages of delinquency in accordance with standards \nestablished by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, \nunmodified credit card loans and scored business \nbanking loans are generally charged off no later than \n180 days past due. Scored auto and closed-end \nconsumer loans, including modified credit card \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n243\naccounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged \noff no later than 120 days past due. \nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged \ndown to their net realizable value earlier than the \nFFIEC charge-off standards in the following \ncircumstances: \n• Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial \ndifficulty that are determined to be collateral-\ndependent. \n• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event \nthat suggests a loss is either known or highly certain \nare subject to accelerated charge-off standards \n(e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are \ncharged off or charged down within 60 days of \nreceiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). \n• Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. \nOther than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm \ntypically does not recognize charge-offs on the \ngovernment-guaranteed portion of loans. \nWholesale loans are charged off when it is highly \ncertain that a loss has been realized. The \ndetermination of whether to recognize a charge-off \nincludes many factors, including the prioritization of \nthe Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the \nworkout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the \nborrower’s equity or the loan collateral. \nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its \namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of \nthe underlying collateral, the determination of the fair \nvalue of the collateral depends on the type of collateral \n(e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the \ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair \nvalue is based on quoted market prices or broker \nquotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, \nthe fair value of the collateral is generally estimated \nusing a discounted cash flow model. \nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are \nbased upon external valuation sources. When it \nbecomes likely that a borrower is either unable or \nunwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price \nopinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation \nmodel of the home based on an exterior-only valuation \n(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least \nevery 12 months, or more frequently depending on \nvarious market factors. As soon as practicable after \nthe Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt \n(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the \nFirm generally obtains an appraisal based on an \ninspection that includes the interior of the home \n(“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior \nappraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s \nexperience with actual liquidation values as compared \nwith the estimated values provided by exterior \nopinions and interior appraisals, considering state-\nspecific factors. \nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are \ngenerally based on appraisals from internal and \nexternal valuation sources. Collateral values are \ntypically updated every six to twelve months, either by \nobtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal \nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The \nFirm also considers both borrower- and market-\nspecific factors, which may result in obtaining \nappraisal updates or broker price opinions at more \nfrequent intervals.\nLoans held-for-sale \nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost \nor fair value, with valuation changes recorded in \nnoninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the \nvaluation is performed on a portfolio basis. For \nwholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an \nindividual loan basis. \nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and \nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price \ndiscounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan \naccount until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees \nor costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment \nto the basis of the loan and therefore are included in \nthe periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair \nvalue adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized \nat the time of sale. \nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of \ncost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses \nand charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. \nHowever, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s \nnonaccrual policies. \nLoans at fair value \nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected \nare measured at fair value, with changes in fair value \nrecorded in noninterest revenue. \nInterest income on these loans is accrued and \nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \nChanges in fair value are recognized in noninterest \nrevenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront \nin noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are \nrecognized in the associated expense category as \nincurred. \nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the \nFirm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off \npolicies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at \nfair value are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. \nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s \nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value \noption. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further \ninformation on loans carried at fair value and classified \nas trading assets. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n244\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nLoan classification changes \nLoans in the held-for-investment portfolio that \nmanagement decides to sell are transferred to the \nheld-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value \non the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are \ncharged against the allowance for loan losses; non-\ncredit related losses such as those due to changes in \ninterest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are \nrecognized in noninterest revenue. \nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan \nin the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to \nthe held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on \nthe date of transfer. These loans are subsequently \nassessed for impairment based on the Firm’s \nallowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further \ndiscussion of the methodologies used in establishing \nthe Firm’s allowance for loan losses. \nLoan modifications \nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction \nwith its loss mitigation activities. Through the \nmodification, JPMorganChase grants one or more \nconcessions to a borrower who is experiencing \nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s \neconomic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession \nof the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments \nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The \nconcessions granted vary by program and by \nborrower-specific characteristics, and may include \ninterest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. \nLoans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs \nare generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in \nmany cases such loans were already on nonaccrual \nstatus prior to modification. These loans may be \nreturned to performing status (the accrual of interest is \nresumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the \nborrower has performed under the modified terms for \na minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) \nthe Firm has an expectation that repayment of the \nmodified loan is reasonably assured based on, for \nexample, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of \nfuture earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other \ncurrent market considerations. In certain limited and \nwell-defined circumstances in which the loan is current \nat the modification date, such loans are not placed on \nnonaccrual status at the time of modification. \nThe allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs \nis measured using the Firm’s established allowance \nmethodology, which considers the expected default \nrates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for \nfurther discussion. \nForeclosed property \nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through \nloan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. \nProperty acquired may include real property (e.g., \nresidential real estate, land, and buildings) and other \ncommercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, \naircraft, railcars, and ships). \nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon \nreceiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking \nlegal title or physical possession). For loans \ncollateralized by real property, the Firm generally \nrecognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or \nupon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure \ntransaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are \nreported in other assets on the Consolidated balance \nsheets and initially recognized at fair value less \nestimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of \nthe acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if \nnecessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. \nSubsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/\ncredited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, \nsuch as real estate taxes and maintenance, are \ncharged to other expense. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n245\nLoan portfolio \nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to \ndetermine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each \nportfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk \ncharacteristics of each loan class. \nConsumer, excluding \ncredit card\nCredit card\nWholesale\n(c)(d)\n• Residential real estate(a)\n• Auto and other(b)\n• Credit card loans\n• Secured by real estate\n• Commercial and industrial\n• Other(e)\n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB.  \n(b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB. \n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when \ndetermining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's \ncollateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, SPEs, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and individual entities (predominantly \nGlobal Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P.

Loans that are more than \n30 days past due provide an early warning of \nborrowers who may be experiencing financial \ndifficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to \nrepay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it \nbecomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to \nbe unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential \nreal estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater \nthan 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans \nthat will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar \nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency \nrates, other credit quality indicators for consumer \nloans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \n• For residential real estate loans, the current \nestimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in \nthe case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the \npotential loss severity in the event of default. \nAdditionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can \nprovide insight into a borrower’s continued \nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-\nLTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans \nwhere the borrower has equity in the collateral. The \ngeographic distribution of the loan collateral also \nprovides insight as to the credit quality of the \nportfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, \nhome price changes and specific events such as \nnatural disasters, will affect credit quality. The \nborrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a \nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, \nas FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s \ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower \nwith a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered \nto be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a \nhigher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with \na high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater \nrisk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both \na high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n• For scored auto and business banking loans, \ngeographic distribution is an indicator of the credit \nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential \nreal estate loans, geographic distribution provides \ninsights into the portfolio performance based on \nregional economic activity and events.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n248\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nResidential real estate \nDelinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

Risk \nratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans \nand differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings \non loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the \nlikelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the \nestimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon \nthe default of the borrower and takes into \nconsideration collateral and structural support for \neach credit facility. \nManagement considers several factors to determine \nan appropriate internal risk rating, including the \nobligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the \nlevel of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources \nfor repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, \nmanagement strength, and the industry and \ngeography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s \ninternal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative \ncharacteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet \nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in \nthe economic environment) defined by S&P and \nMoody’s, however the quantitative characteristics \n(e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal \nhistorical experiences and assumptions. The Firm \ngenerally considers internal ratings with qualitative \ncharacteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as \ninvestment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD \nand/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.  \nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as \nnoncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion \nis further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual \nloans, representing management’s assessment of the \ncollectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans \nhave a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s \ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking \nregulatory definition of criticized exposures, which \nconsist of special mention, substandard and doubtful \ncategories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.   \nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing \nbasis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as \nnecessary for updated information affecting the \nobligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the \nindustry in which the obligor conducts its operations. \nAs part of the overall credit risk management \nframework, the Firm focuses on the management and \ndiversification of its industry and client exposures, with \nparticular attention paid to industries with an actual or \npotential credit concern.

Additional commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial \ndifficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs in Secured by real estate were not material at each period.\nNature and extent of TDRs\nPrior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided \nvarious concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other \ninsignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm \nelected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $801 million. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, \n2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to \nthe Firm. \nAs a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves \na concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n265\nNote 13 – Allowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents \nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses over \nthe remaining expected life of the Firm's financial \nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The \nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s \nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, \nwhich is presented on the Consolidated balance \nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities, which is reflected in investment securities \non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the \nallowance for credit losses is recognized in the \nprovision for credit losses. \nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for \ncredit losses is complex and requires significant \njudgment by management about the effect of matters \nthat are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the \nallowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the \nCFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent \nevaluations of credit exposures, considering the \nmacroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors \nthen prevailing, may result in significant changes in the \nallowance for credit losses in future periods. \nThe Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for \nloan losses and its allowance for lending-related \ncommitments are described in the following \nparagraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the \npolicies used to determine the allowance for credit \nlosses on investment securities. \nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and \nlending-related commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for \nlending-related commitments represents expected \ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of \nretained loans and lending-related commitments that \nare not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not \nrecord an allowance for future draws on unconditionally \ncancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit \ncards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on \ncredit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance \nfor loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an \nallowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to \nits policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 \ndays past due by reversing interest income. \nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by \nconsidering its contractual term, expected \nprepayments, cancellation features, and certain \nextension and call options. The expected life of funded \ncredit card loans is generally estimated by considering \nexpected future payments on the credit card account, \nand determining how much of those amounts should be \nallocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as \nof the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. \nThis allocation is made using an approach that \nincorporates the payment application requirements of \nthe Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and \nDisclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the \nhighest interest rate balances first. \nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes \nexpected recoveries of amounts previously charged off \nor expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries \nresult in a negative allowance. \nCollective and Individual Assessments\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the \nallowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm \nassesses whether exposures share similar risk \ncharacteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the \nFirm estimates expected credit losses collectively, \nconsidering the risk associated with a particular pool \nand the probability that the exposures within the pool \nwill deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk \ncharacteristics is subject to significant management \njudgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another \nor considering additional characteristics could affect \nthe allowance. \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer \nportfolio include product type, delinquency status, \ncurrent FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for \ncollateralized loans, current LTV ratios.  \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale \nportfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, \ntenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, \nindustry, credit enhancement, product type, facility \npurpose, and payment terms. \nThe majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk \ncharacteristics with other similar exposures, and as a \nresult are collectively assessed for impairment \n(“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based \ncomponent covers consumer loans, performing risk-\nrated loans and certain lending-related commitments. \nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with \nother exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected \ncredit losses on an individual basis, considering \nexpected repayment and conditions impacting that \nindividual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The \nasset-specific component covers collateral-dependent \nloans and risk-rated loans that have been placed on \nnonaccrual status. \nPortfolio-based component\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a \nquantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of \nthe borrower changing delinquency status or moving \nfrom one risk rating to another. The quantitative \ncalculation covers expected credit losses over an \ninstrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying \ncredit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at \ndefault. The credit loss factors incorporate the \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n266\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nprobability of borrower default as well as loss severity in \nthe event of default. They are derived using a weighted \naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic \nscenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, \nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to \nrevert to long run historical information for periods \nbeyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five \nmacroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative \nadverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme \nupside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central \nforecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration \nthe Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal \nperspectives from subject matter experts across the \nFirm, and market consensus and involve a governed \nprocess that incorporates feedback from senior \nmanagement across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk \nManagement.\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into \nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk \nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that \nare not yet reflected in the calculation. These \nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the \nhistorical loss experience, including during stressed \nperiods, for each major product or model. Management \napplies judgment in making this adjustment, including \ntaking into account uncertainties associated with the \neconomic and political conditions, quality of \nunderwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit \nconcentrations or deterioration within an industry, \nproduct or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal \nand external factors affecting the credit quality of the \nportfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships \nbetween these factors create further uncertainties.\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative \ncalculation, and the assumptions used by management \nto adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to \nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing \none input or assumption over another, or considering \nother inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate \nof the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for \nlending-related commitments.\nAsset-specific component \nTo determine the asset-specific component of the \nallowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those \nloans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual \nrisk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are \ngenerally evaluated individually.\nFor collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of \ncollateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is \nused to determine the charge-off amount for declines in \nvalue (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the \nfair value of collateral) or the amount of negative \nallowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of \nprior charge-offs associated with improvements in the \nfair value of the collateral).\nFor non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally \nmeasures the asset-specific allowance as the \ndifference between the amortized cost of the loan and \nthe present value of the cash flows expected to be \ncollected, discounted at the loan’s effective interest \nrate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally \nrecognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan \nlosses. The asset-specific component of the allowance \nfor non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the \neffect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash \nflows including changes in interest rates, principal \nforgiveness, and other concessions, as well as  \nmanagement’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to \nrepay under the modified terms. \nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows \nis highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely \nupon estimates such as loss severities, asset \nvaluations, the amounts and timing of interest or \nprincipal payments (including any expected \nprepayments) or other factors that are reflective of \ncurrent and expected market conditions. These \nestimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the \nduration of current overall economic conditions, \nindustry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the \nexpected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well \nas, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All \nof these estimates and assumptions require significant \nmanagement judgment and certain assumptions are \nhighly subjective. \nOther financial assets\nIn addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm \nholds other financial assets that are measured at \namortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, \nincluding credit exposures arising from lending \nactivities subject to collateral maintenance \nrequirements. Management estimates the allowance \nfor other financial assets using various techniques \nconsidering historical losses and current economic \nconditions. \nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to \ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally \nmitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of \nthe activity, the fair value of collateral held and the \nFirm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to \nprovide additional margin when the fair value of the \ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, \nthese exposures generally do not require an allowance \nfor credit losses. However, management may also \nconsider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing \nability to provide collateral to satisfy margin \nrequirements, or whether collateral is significantly \nconcentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with \nsimilar risk characteristics. If in management’s \njudgment, an allowance for credit losses for these \nexposures is required, the Firm estimates expected \ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral and \nprobability of borrower default.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n267\nAllowance for credit losses and related information \nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses and includes a breakdown of loans \nand lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

As asset \nmanager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment \nobjective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, \nconsidered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\n• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are \ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of \ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties \nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have \nthe power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. \nRefer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs \nsponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third \nparties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations\nCCB’s Card Services business may securitize \noriginated credit card loans, primarily through the \nChase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s \ncontinuing involvement in credit card securitizations \nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an \nundivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining \ncertain senior and subordinated securities and \nmaintaining escrow accounts. \nThe Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its \nsponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be \nthe primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts \nbased on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of \nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and \nother duties, including making decisions as to the \nreceivables that are transferred into those trusts and \nas to any related modifications and workouts. \nAdditionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other \ncontinuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated \nabove, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives \nthe Firm the right to receive certain benefits from \nthese VIEs that could potentially be significant. \nThe underlying securitized credit card receivables and \nother assets of the securitization trusts are available \nonly for payment of the beneficial interests issued by \nthe securitization trusts; they are not available to pay \nthe Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s \ncreditors. \nThe agreements with the credit card securitization \ntrusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum \nundivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally \n5%). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held \nundivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card \nsecuritization trusts of $6.6 billion and $4.9 billion, \nrespectively. The Firm maintained an average \nundivided interest in principal receivables owned by \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n271\nthose trusts of approximately 45% and 65% for the \nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively. The Firm did not retain any senior \nsecurities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated \nsecurities in certain of its credit card securitization \ntrusts at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Firm’s \nundivided interests in the credit card trusts and \nsecurities retained are eliminated in consolidation. \nFirm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization \ntrusts\nThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated \nand purchased residential mortgages, commercial \nmortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its \nCCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular \ntransaction, as well as the respective business \ninvolved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans \nand/or retain certain beneficial interests in the \nsecuritization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label \nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are \nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or \nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or \nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is \nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value \nof these interests.

CCB generally retains servicing for all residential \nmortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for \ncertain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For \nsecuritizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has \nthe power to direct the significant activities of the VIE \nbecause it is responsible for decisions related to loan \nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an \ninterest upon securitization.\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading \nactivities involving securities issued by Firm-\nsponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at \ntimes retains senior and/or subordinated interests \n(including residual interests and amounts required to \nbe held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in \nresidential mortgage securitizations at the time of \nsecuritization, and/or reacquires positions in the \nsecondary market in the normal course of business. In \ncertain instances, as a result of the positions retained \nor reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or \nCCB, when considered together with the servicing \narrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is \ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain \nsecuritization trusts. \nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage \nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-\nsponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore \ndoes not have the power to direct the most significant \nactivities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial \ninterest in the trust that could potentially be significant \nto the trust.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer \nsecuritizations\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage \nloans, and engages in underwriting and trading \nactivities involving the securities issued by \nsecuritization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/\nor subordinated interests (including amounts required \nto be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in \ncommercial mortgage securitizations at the time of \nsecuritization but, generally, the Firm does not service \ncommercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO \nmay choose to invest in these securitizations as well. \nFor commercial mortgage securitizations the power to \ndirect the significant activities of the VIE generally is \nheld by the servicer or investors in a specified class of \nsecurities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally \ndoes not retain an interest in the controlling class in its \nsponsored commercial mortgage securitization \ntransactions.\nRe-securitizations\nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization \ntransactions in which debt securities are transferred to \na VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These \ntransfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and \ngovernment agency sponsored VIEs, which are \nbacked by residential mortgages. The Firm’s \nconsolidation analysis is largely dependent on the \nFirm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of \nsecurities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government \nagencies\n$ 44,456 \n$ 18,864 \n$ 16,128 \nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved \nare client-driven transactions in which a specific client \nor group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk \nprofile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded \nthat the decision-making power of the entity is shared \nbetween the Firm and its clients, considering the joint \neffort and decisions in establishing the re-\nsecuritization trust and its assets, as well as the \nsignificant economic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not \nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to \nre-securitization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, \nand retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored \nVIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not \nmaterial.\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests \nof third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and \ngenerally purchases these interests in the secondary \nmarket. In these circumstances, the Firm does not \nhave the unilateral ability to direct the most significant \nactivities of the re-securitization trust, either because \nit was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or \nthe Firm was involved with an independent third-party \nsponsor and demonstrated shared power over the \ncreation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not \nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n273\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's \ninterests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nDecember 31, \n(in millions)\nNonconsolidated \nre-securitization VIEs\n2024\n2023\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies\nInterest in VIEs\n$ \n3,219 \n$ \n3,371 \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm did not \nconsolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs.\nMulti-seller conduits\nMulti-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy \nremote entities that provide secured financing, \ncollateralized by pools of receivables and other \nfinancial assets, to customers of the Firm. The \nconduits fund their financing facilities through the \nissuance of highly rated commercial paper. The \nprimary source of repayment of the commercial paper \nis the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most \ninstances, the assets are structured with deal-specific \ncredit enhancements provided to the conduits by the \ncustomers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-\nspecific credit enhancements are generally structured \nto cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the \npool of assets, and are typically in the form of \novercollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-\nspecific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s \npotential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, \nand to provide the conduits with funding to provide \nfinancing to customers in the event that the conduits \ndo not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, \neach asset pool financed by the conduits has a \nminimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility \nassociated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, \nN.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the \nmulti-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted \nprogram-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide \ncredit enhancement in the form of standby letters of \ncredit. The amount of program-wide credit \nenhancement required is based upon commercial \npaper issuance and approximates 10% of the \noutstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-\nseller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to \ndirect the significant activities of the conduits and a \npotentially significant economic interest in the \nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in \nstructuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions \nregarding asset types and credit quality, and manages \nthe commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. \nThe Firm’s interests that could potentially be \nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received as \nadministrative agent and liquidity and program-wide \ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential \nexposure created by the liquidity and credit \nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorganChase \nmakes markets in and invests in commercial paper \nissued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. \nThe Firm held $2.9 billion and $9.8 billion of the \ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered \nmulti-seller conduits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, which have been eliminated in \nconsolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the \nFirm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven \nby market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required \nto be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the \nFirm is not obligated under any agreement to \npurchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity \nand credit enhancement provided by the Firm have \nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-\nrelated commitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded \ncommitments were $10.3 billion and $10.8 billion at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are \nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related \ncommitments in other unfunded commitments to \nextend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information \non off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. \nMunicipal bond vehicles\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) \ntrusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond \ninvestments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB \ntransaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal \nbond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by \nissuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-\nrate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-\nrate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are \ntypically purchased by money market funds or other \nshort-term investors and may be tendered, with \nrequisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are \nretained by the investor seeking to finance its \nmunicipal bond investment. TOB transactions where \nthe residual is held by a third-party investor are \ntypically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are transactions where the \nResidual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts \nare sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as \nsponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The \nFirm may provide various services to a TOB trust, \nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option \nprovider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing \nagent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing \nagent is responsible for establishing the periodic \nvariable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n274\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nplacement and remarketing tendered floaters. The \nremarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make \nmarkets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not \nmaterial during 2024 and 2023.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities \nLLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option \nprovider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s \nobligation to perform is conditional and is limited by \ncertain events (“Termination Events”), which include \nbankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond \nissuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of \ntaxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate \ndowngrade of the municipal bond to below investment \ngrade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is \ntypically further limited by the high credit quality of the \nunderlying municipal bonds, the excess \ncollateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain \ntransactions, the reimbursement agreements with the \nResidual holders.\nHolders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their \nfloaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent \ncannot successfully remarket the floaters to another \ninvestor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to \nthe TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the \nfloaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. \nTOB trusts are considered to be variable interest \nentities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB \ntrusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the \nright to make decisions that significantly impact the \neconomic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, \nand it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses \nthat could potentially be significant to the municipal \nbond vehicle.  \nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAssets\nLiabilities\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in millions)\nTrading \nassets\nLoans\nOther\n(c)\n Total \nassets\n(d)\nBeneficial \ninterests in \nVIE assets\n(e)\nOther\n(f)\nTotal \nliabilities\nVIE program type\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts\n$ \n— $ \n13,531 \n$ \n168 $ \n13,699 \n$ \n5,312 $ \n10 $ \n5,322 \nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits"

These include, for example, acting as \na derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, \nunderwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, \ntrustee or custodian. These transactions are \nconducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit \ndecisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, \ntaking into consideration the quality of the underlying \nassets. Where the Firm does not have the power to \ndirect the activities of the VIE that most significantly \nimpact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable \ninterest that could potentially be significant, the Firm \ngenerally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records \nand reports these positions on its Consolidated \nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record \nand report positions in respect of any other third-party \ntransaction. \nTax credit vehicles \nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax \ncredit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and \nsimilar entities that own and operate affordable \nhousing, alternative energy, and other projects. These \nentities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is \ntypically the general partner or managing member and \nhas control over the significant activities of the tax \ncredit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not \nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally \ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and \nearns a return primarily through the receipt of tax \ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss \nexposure, represented by equity investments and \nfunding commitments, was $35.2 billion and $35.1 \nbillion, of which $15.0 billion and $14.7 billion was \nunfunded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively. The Firm assesses each project and to \nreduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts \nof its capital investment until the project qualifies for \ntax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on \noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to \nthe Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit \nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization \nMethod guidance which expanded the types of tax-\noriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax \ncredit investments, that the Firm can elect on a \nprogram by program basis, to be accounted for using \nthe proportional amortization method. Refer to Notes \n1, 6 and 25 for further information.\nThe proportional amortization method requires the \ncost of eligible investments, within an elected \nprogram, be amortized in proportion to the tax \nbenefits received with the resulting amortization \nreported directly in income tax expense, which aligns \nwith the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. \nInvestments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, \nincluding that substantially all of the return is from \nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits.\nIn addition, under this method deferred taxes are \ngenerally not recorded as the investment is now \namortized in proportion to the income tax credits and \nother income tax benefits received. Delayed equity \ncontributions that are unconditional and legally \nbinding or conditional and probable of occurring are \nrecorded in other liabilities with a corresponding \nincrease in the carrying value of the investment. The \nguidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible \ninvestments when significant modifications or events \noccur that result in a change in the nature of the \ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship with \nthe underlying project. During the period, there were \nno significant modifications or events that resulted in a \nchange in the nature of an eligible investment or a \nchange in the Firm's relationship with the underlying \nproject.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to \napply the proportional amortization method. \nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nAlternative energy and \naffordable housing programs\n(d)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPrograms for which the Firm \nelected proportional \namortization:\nCarrying value\n(a)\n$ 31,978 $ 14,644 $ 12,052 \nTax credits and other tax \nbenefits\n(b)"

In certain customer TOB \ntransactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has \nentered into a reimbursement agreement with the \nResidual holder. In those transactions, upon the \ntermination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the \nthird-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm \ndoes not have any intent to protect Residual holders \nfrom potential losses on any of the underlying \nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate \ncustomer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the \npower to make decisions that significantly impact the \neconomic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.\nThe Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider \nto customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2024 and \n2023, was $5.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. \nThe fair value of assets held by such VIEs at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 was $8.1 billion and $7.3 \nbillion, respectively.\nLoan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card \nreceivables, commercial mortgages and other \nconsumer loans. The purposes of these securitization \ntransactions were to satisfy investor demand and to \ngenerate liquidity for the Firm.\nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not \nrequired to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the \ntransfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale \nwhen all of the following accounting criteria for a sale \nare met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally \nisolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or \nbeneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the \ntransferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not \nmaintain effective control over the transferred financial \nassets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the \ntransferred assets before their maturity and it does not \nhave the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to \nreturn the transferred assets).\nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the \nFirm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference \nbetween the value of proceeds received (including \ncash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) \nand the carrying value of the assets sold.

For 2023, \npredominantly represents estimated goodwill associated with \nthe acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM in AWM and \nthe acquisition of Aumni Inc., predominantly in CIB. For 2022, \nrepresents estimated goodwill associated with the acquisitions \nof Global Shares PLC in AWM, Frosch Travel Group, LLC and \nFigg, Inc. in CCB, and Renovite Technologies, Inc. and \nVolkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB.\n(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments.\nGoodwill impairment testing\nThe Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe goodwill impairment test is generally performed \nby comparing the current fair value of each reporting \nunit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess \nof the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill \nis considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less \nthan the carrying value, then an impairment is \nrecognized for the amount by which the reporting \nunit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the \namount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nThe Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital \nplus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for \nthe carrying values of equity for the reporting units in \nthe goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity \nis determined on a similar basis as the allocation of \ncapital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a \nvariety of factors including capital levels of similarly \nrated peers and applicable regulatory capital \nrequirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are \nincorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, \nwhich is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and \nOperating Committee. \nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair \nvalue of its reporting units is the income approach. \nThis approach projects cash flows for the forecast \nperiod and uses the perpetuity growth method to \ncalculate terminal values. These cash flows and \nterminal values, which are based on the reporting \nunits’ annual budgets and forecasts are then \ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate. The \ndiscount rate used for each reporting unit represents \nan estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit \nand is determined considering the Firm’s overall \nestimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital \nAsset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk \ncharacteristics specific to each reporting unit (for \nexample, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty \nassociated with the business or management’s \nforecasts and assumptions). To assess the \nreasonableness of the discount rates used for each \nreporting unit, management compares the discount \nrate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded \ninstitutions with similar businesses and risk \ncharacteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost \nof equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is \ncompared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of \nequity for reasonableness. The valuations derived \nfrom the discounted cash flow analysis are then \ncompared with market-based trading and transaction \nmultiples for relevant competitors. Trading and \ntransaction comparables are used as general \nindicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the \nestimated fair values, although precise conclusions \ngenerally cannot be drawn due to the differences that \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n280\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nnaturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and \ncompetitor institutions. \nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison \nbetween the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s \nreporting units and JPMorganChase’s market \ncapitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm \nconsiders several factors, including (i) a control \npremium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) \nfactors related to the level of execution risk that would \nexist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the \nreporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility \nand other factors that do not directly affect the value of \nindividual reporting units.\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, \nincreases in credit losses, increases in capital \nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or \nmarket conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative \nchanges or increases in the estimated market cost of \nequity, could cause the estimated fair values of the \nFirm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which \ncould result in a material impairment loss to earnings \nin a future period related to some portion of the \nassociated goodwill. \nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash \nflows for performing servicing activities for others. The \nfair value considers estimated future servicing fees \nand ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to \nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as \nnet servicing cash flows are received, effectively \namortizing the MSR asset against contractual \nservicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either \npurchased from third parties or recognized upon sale \nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is \nretained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to \naccount for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its \nMSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the \navailability of market inputs used to measure the fair \nvalue of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as \none aggregate pool for risk management purposes. \nThe Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an \noption-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects \nMSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in \nconjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and \nthen discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. \nThe model considers portfolio characteristics, \ncontractually specified servicing fees, prepayment \nassumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late \ncharges and other ancillary revenue, and other \neconomic factors. The Firm compares fair value \nestimates and assumptions to observable market data \nwhere available, and also considers recent market \nactivity and actual portfolio experience. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n281\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in \ninterest rates, including their effect on prepayment \nspeeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when \ninterest rates decline because declining interest rates \ntend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce \nthe expected life of the net servicing cash flows that \ncomprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., \nmortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives \n(e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate \ninterest payments) increase in value when interest \nrates decline. JPMorganChase uses combinations of \nderivatives and securities to manage the risk of \nchanges in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to \noffset any interest-rate related changes in the fair \nvalue of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the \nrelated risk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFair value at beginning of period\n$ \n8,522 \n$ \n7,973 \n$ \n5,494 \nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs"

These leases generally have terms \nof 20 years or less, determined based on the \ncontractual maturity of the lease, and include periods \ncovered by options to extend or terminate the lease \nwhen the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise \nthose options. All leases with lease terms greater than \ntwelve months are reported as a lease liability with a \ncorresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of \nthese lease agreements impose restrictions on the \nFirm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or \nequity financing transactions or enter into further lease \nagreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation \nclauses that will increase rental payments based on \nmaintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-\nlease components. The Firm elected not to separate \nlease and non-lease components of a contract for its \nreal estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments \nrepresent payments on both lease and non-lease \ncomponents. \nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are \nrecognized at the lease commencement date based \non the present value of the future minimum lease \npayments over the lease term.

This method \nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future \ntax consequences of temporary differences between \nthe carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book \nand tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or \nliability for each temporary difference is determined \nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in \neffect when the underlying items of income and \nexpense are realized. JPMorganChase’s expense for \nincome taxes includes the current and deferred \nportions of that expense. A valuation allowance is \nestablished to reduce deferred tax assets to the \namount the Firm expects to realize. \nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the \nnature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting \nbusiness and being taxed in a substantial number of \njurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are \nrequired to be made.

Most of these \ncommitments and guarantees have historically been \nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without \nbeing drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the \ntotal contractual amount of these instruments is not, in \nthe Firm’s view, representative of its expected future \ncredit exposure or funding requirements. \nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and \ncertain consumer lending-related commitments, an \nallowance for credit losses on lending-related \ncommitments is maintained.

The Firm \nalso issues commitments under multipurpose facilities \nwhich could be drawn upon in several forms, including \nthe issuance of a standby letter of credit. \nGuarantees \nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the \ninception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal \nto the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing \nthe guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a \ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to \npay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in \nan underlying asset, liability or equity security of the \nguaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to \nperform under a specified agreement. The Firm \nconsiders the following off–balance sheet \narrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: \nstandby letters of credit and other financial \nguarantees, securities lending indemnifications, \ncertain indemnification agreements included within \nthird-party contractual arrangements, certain \nderivative contracts and the guarantees under the \nsponsored member repo program. \nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records \nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-\ncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of \nconsideration received or the net present value of the \npremium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm \nrecords this fair value amount in other liabilities with an \noffsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums \nreceived), or other assets (for premiums receivable). \nAny premium receivable recorded in other assets is \nreduced as cash is received under the contract, and \nthe fair value of the liability recorded at inception is \namortized into income as lending and deposit-related \nfees over the life of the guarantee contract. The \nlending-related contingent obligation is recognized \nbased on expected credit losses in addition to, and \nseparate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are \nrecognized when the liability becomes probable and \nreasonably estimable. These obligations are not \nrecognized if the estimated amount is less than the \ncarrying amount of any non-contingent liability \nrecognized at inception (adjusted for any \namortization). Examples of non-lending-related \ncontingent obligations include indemnifications \nprovided in sales agreements, where a portion of the \nsale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which \nadjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result \nfrom the transaction. For these indemnifications, the \ninitial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk \nis reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification \nexpires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of \nguarantees and indemnifications are included in the \ntable on page 303.\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see \nbelow. \nStandby letters of credit and other financial \nguarantees \nStandby letters of credit and other financial \nguarantees are conditional lending commitments \nissued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a \nclient or customer to a third party under certain \narrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, \nbond financings, acquisition financings, trade \nfinancings and similar transactions. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other \nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2024\n2023\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nStandby letters of credit \nand \nother financial guarantees\nOther letters \nof credit\nStandby letters of credit \nand \nother financial guarantees\nOther letters \nof credit\nInvestment-grade\n(a)\n$ \n20,443 \n$ \n3,380 \n$ \n19,694 \n$ \n3,552 \nNoninvestment-grade\n(a)"

To minimize its liability \nunder these indemnification agreements, the Firm \nobtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a \nmarket value exceeding 100% of the value of the \nsecurities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is \nmarked to market daily to help assure that \ncollateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is \ncalled from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or \ncollateral may be released to the borrower in the event \nof overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm \nwould use the collateral held to purchase replacement \nsecurities in the market or to credit the lending client \nor counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. \nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested \non behalf of the client in indemnified resale \nagreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client \nagainst the loss of principal invested. To minimize its \nliability under these agreements, the Firm obtains \ncollateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the \nprincipal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees \nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that \nhave the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. \nGAAP. These contracts include written put options \nthat require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise \nby the option holder at a specified price by a specified \ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written put \noption contracts in order to meet client needs, or for \nother trading purposes. The terms of written put \noptions are typically five years or less. \nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes \nstable value contracts, commonly referred to as \n“stable value products”, that require the Firm to make \na payment of the difference between the market value \nand the book value of a counterparty’s reference \nportfolio of assets in the event that market value is less \nthan book value and certain other conditions have \nbeen met. Stable value products are transacted in \norder to allow investors to realize investment returns \nwith less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These \ncontracts are typically longer-term or may have no \nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to \nterminate the contract under certain conditions. \nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally \nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, \nexposure to certain stable value products is \ncontractually limited to a substantially lower \npercentage of the notional amount. \nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the \nprobability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will \nbe required to perform under the contract. The Firm \nreduces exposures to these contracts by entering into \noffsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts \nthat hedge the market risk related to the derivative \nguarantees. \nThe following table summarizes the derivatives \nqualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023.\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees\n$ \n49,628 \n$ \n54,562 \nStable value contracts with \ncontractually limited exposure"

Refer to Note 5 for a further \ndiscussion of credit derivatives. \nUnsettled securities financing agreements \nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into \nresale and securities borrowed agreements. At \nsettlement, these commitments result in the Firm \nadvancing cash to and receiving securities collateral \nfrom the counterparty. The Firm also enters into \nrepurchase and securities loaned agreements. At \nsettlement, these commitments result in the Firm \nreceiving cash from and providing securities collateral \nto the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future \ndate. These agreements generally do not meet the \ndefinition of a derivative, and therefore, are not \nrecorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until \nsettlement date. These agreements predominantly  \nhave regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for \na further discussion of securities financing \nagreements. \nLoan sales- and securitization-related \nindemnifications \nMortgage repurchase liability \nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and \nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has \nmade representations and warranties that the loans \nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require \nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or \nindemnify the loan purchaser if such representations \nand warranties are breached by the Firm. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n305\nPrivate label securitizations\nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated \nwith private label securitizations is separately \nevaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation \nreserves. \nRefer to Note 30 for additional information regarding \nlitigation. \nLoans sold with recourse \nThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain \ncommercial lending products on both a recourse and \nnonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the \nprincipal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary \nservicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing \nadvances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees \nto share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage \nloans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private \ninvestor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse \nservicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales \nproceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan \nare less than the sum of the outstanding principal \nbalance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost \nof holding and disposing of the underlying property. \nThe Firm’s securitizations are predominantly \nnonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk \nof future credit losses to the purchaser of the \nmortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The \nunpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as \nwell as the carrying value of the related liability that the \nFirm has recorded in accounts payable and other \nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is \nrepresentative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will \nhave to perform under its recourse obligations, are \ndisclosed in the table on page 303.\nOther off-balance sheet arrangements \nIndemnification agreements – general \nIn connection with issuing securities to investors \noutside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional \namounts to the holders of the securities in the event \nthat, due to a change in tax law, certain types of \nwithholding taxes are imposed on payments on the \nsecurities. The terms of the securities may also give \nthe Firm the right to redeem the securities if such \nadditional amounts are payable. The Firm may also \nenter into indemnification clauses such as in \nconnection with the licensing of software to clients \n(“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or \nassets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), \npursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for \nclaims of liability or damages that may occur \nsubsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-\nparty purchasers for losses they may incur due to \nactions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the \nbusiness or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s \nmaximum exposure under these indemnification \narrangements, since this would require an assessment \nof future changes in tax law and future claims that may \nbe made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. \nHowever, based on historical experience, \nmanagement expects the risk of loss to be remote. \nMerchant charge-backs  \nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a \nmerchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services \nbusiness in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability \nfor disputed processed credit and debit card \ntransactions that result in a charge-back to the \nmerchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s \nfavor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing \nbank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder \nand will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If \nthe Firm is unable to collect the amount from the \nmerchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount \ncredited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm \nmitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, \nretaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other \ncollateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation \nallowance that covers the payment or performance \nrisk related to charge-backs. \nClearing Services – Client Credit Risk \nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by \nentering into securities purchases and sales and \nderivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as \nfutures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative \ncontracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands \nbehind the performance of its clients, collects cash \nand securities collateral (margin) as well as any \nsettlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits \nthem to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. \nThere are two types of margin: variation margin is \nposted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ \nderivative contracts and initial margin is posted at \ninception of a derivative contract, generally on the \nbasis of the potential changes in the variation margin \nrequirement for the contract. \nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk \nof nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to \nclients for the performance of the CCPs. Where \npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client \nthrough the collection of appropriate amounts of \nmargin at inception and throughout the life of the \ntransactions. The Firm can also cease providing \nclearing services if clients do not adhere to their \nobligations under the clearing agreement. In the event \nof nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close \nout the client’s positions and access available margin. \nThe CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make \nitself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to \nbe paid by the Firm as a clearing member. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n306\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk \nof the client through the recognition of margin \nreceivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; \nthe clients’ underlying securities or derivative \ncontracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. \nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible \nexposure through its role as a clearing member, as this \nwould require an assessment of transactions that \nclients may execute in the future. However, based \nupon historical experience, and the credit risk \nmitigants available to the Firm, management believes \nit is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any \nmaterial payments under these arrangements and the \nrisk of loss is expected to be remote. \nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that \nthe Firm executes for its own account and records in \nits Consolidated Financial Statements. \nExchange & Clearing House Memberships \nThe Firm is a member of several securities and \nderivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the \nU.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing \nservices to its clients. Membership in some of these \norganizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share \nof the losses incurred by the organization as a result of \nthe default of another member. Such obligations vary \nwith different organizations. These obligations may be \nlimited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of \nthe Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund \nmaintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of \nthe resources available to cover any losses in the event \nof a member default. Alternatively, these obligations \nmay also include a pro rata share of the residual losses \nafter applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain \nclearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a \npro rata share of losses that may result from the \nclearing house’s investment of guarantee fund \ncontributions and initial margin, unrelated to and \nindependent of the default of another \nmember. Generally a payment would only be required \nshould such losses exceed the resources of the \nclearing house or exchange that are contractually \nrequired to absorb the losses in the first instance. In \ncertain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s \nmaximum possible exposure under these membership \nagreements, since this would require an assessment of \nfuture claims that may be made against the Firm that \nhave not yet occurred. However, based on historical \nexperience, management expects the risk of loss to \nthe Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum \npossible exposure can be estimated, the amount is \ndisclosed in the table on page 303, in the Exchange & \nclearing house guarantees and commitments line.  \nSponsored member repo program \nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible \novernight and term resale and repurchase agreements \nthrough the Government Securities Division of the \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf \nof clients that become sponsored members under the \nFICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the \nprompt and full payment and performance of its \nsponsored member clients’ respective obligations \nunder the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability \nunder these guarantees by obtaining a security \ninterest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral \nthat the clients place with the clearing house; \ntherefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be \nremote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, \nwithout taking into consideration the associated \ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house \nguarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer \nto Note 11 for additional information on credit risk \nmitigation practices on resale agreements and the \ntypes of collateral pledged under repurchase \nagreements. \nGuarantees of subsidiaries \nIn the normal course of business, the Parent Company \nmay provide counterparties with guarantees of certain \nof the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries \non a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the \nFirm’s counterparties. The obligations of the \nsubsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated \nbalance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet \ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not \nrecognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \nThe Firm believes that the occurrence of any event \nthat would trigger payments by the Parent Company \nunder these guarantees is remote. \nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-\nterm debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, \nincluding JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC \n(“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All \nsecurities issued by JPMFC are fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company \nand no other subsidiary of the Parent Company \nguarantees these securities. These guarantees, which \nrank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and \nunsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the \ntable on page 303 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for \nadditional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n307\nNote 29 – Pledged assets and collateral \nPledged assets \nThe Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to \nmaintain potential borrowing capacity at discount \nwindows with Federal Reserve banks, various other \ncentral banks and FHLBs.

The litigations range from \nindividual actions involving a single plaintiff to class \naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class \nmembers. Investigations and regulatory enforcement \nmatters involve both formal and informal proceedings, \nby both governmental agencies and self-regulatory \norganizations. These legal proceedings are at varying \nstages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and \ninvolve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several \ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including \ncommon law tort and contract claims and statutory \nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), \nsome of which present novel legal theories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range \nof reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves \nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to \napproximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024. This \nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible \nlosses was based upon information available as of that \ndate for those proceedings in which the Firm believes \nthat an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be \nmade. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe \nthat such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The \nFirm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably \npossible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n• the number, variety and varying stages of the \nproceedings, including the fact that many are in \npreliminary stages, \n• the existence in many such proceedings of multiple \ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of \nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \n• the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the \nproceedings, including issues regarding class \ncertification and the scope of many of the claims, and \n• the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of \nsuch proceedings, including where the Firm has made \nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or \nother adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives \nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those \nassumptions prove to be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may \nbe a result which the Firm did not take into account in its \nestimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of \nthat outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s \nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible \nlosses will change from time to time, and actual losses \nmay vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material \nlegal proceedings.\n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as \na defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in \nMalaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a \nMalaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. \nThe claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. \nMorgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of \n$300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, \nrespectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an \naccount at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB \nPetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between \n1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In \nMarch 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to \nthe validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s \njurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been \nappealed by 1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an \napplication by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with \npermission to re-file a new claim in the future. That \ndecision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and \nan appeals court is scheduled to hear both appeals in \nNovember 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent \nany claim from continuing.   \nIn addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the \nAttorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. \nMorgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an \ninvestigation into possible criminal liability in \nconnection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan \n(Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi \njoint venture and its related persons for the period \nSeptember 2009 through August 2015. The OAG \ninvestigation is ongoing. \nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is \ninvestigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in \nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by \ntwo offshore funds formerly managed by \nJPMorganChase entities into residential housing \nprojects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) \nrelating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver \nresidential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order \nfining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately \n$31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. \nRelatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India \nissued an order making preliminary findings that \nAmrapali and other parties, including unspecified \nJPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had \ninvested in the projects, violated certain criminal \ncurrency control and money laundering provisions, and \nordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is \nresponding to and cooperating with the inquiry.   \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The \nFirm previously reported settlements with certain \ngovernment authorities relating to its foreign exchange \n(“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to \nthose activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, \nthe Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal \nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted \nthe Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n309\naffiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional \nAsset Manager exemption under the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the \nten-year disqualification period following the antitrust \nplea. The only remaining FX-related governmental \ninquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission \nmatter which is currently pending before the South \nAfrica Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related \nindividual and putative class actions filed outside the \nU.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil \nand Australia, remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of \nAppeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's \nearlier denial of a request for class certification on an \nopt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this \ndecision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a \nsettlement in principle has been reached on the \nputative class action, which remains subject to court \napproval. \nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail \nassociations filed a series of class action complaints \nalleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain \nbanks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit \ncard interchange fees and enacted related rules in \nviolation of antitrust laws.\nIn September 2018, the parties settled the class action \nseeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively \ncontributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement \nhas been approved by the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on \nappeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that \nopted out of the settlement, $700 million has been \nreturned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. \nA separate class action seeking injunctive relief \ncontinues, and in September 2021, the District Court \ngranted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, \nand denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District \nCourt denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the \ninjunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard \nagreed to certain changes to their respective network \nrules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates \nfor U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering \nnext steps. \nOf the merchants who opted out of the damages class \nsettlement, certain merchants filed individual actions \nraising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, \nas well as against the Firm and other banks. While some \nof those actions remain pending, the defendants have \nreached settlements with the merchants who opted out \nrepresenting over 70% of the combined Mastercard-\nbranded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and \nLitigation. JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries \nfrom various governmental agencies and entities \naround the world relating primarily to the British \nBankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank \nOffered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the \nEuropean Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered \nRate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition \nCommission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to \nwhich the Firm and one other bank remain subject, \ncontinues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 \ndecision by the European Commission against the Firm \nand other banks finding an infringement of European \nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, \nthe European General Court annulled the fine imposed \nby the European Commission, but exercised its \ndiscretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In \nMarch 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision \nwith the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant \nalong with other banks in various individual and putative \nclass actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. \ndollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR \nduring the period that it was administered by the BBA, \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District \nof New York granted class certification of antitrust \nclaims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold \ndirectly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm \nhas obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved \ncertain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has \nmoved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit \nfiled by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust \nclaims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants \nwere engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. \ndollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market \nfor LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was \ndismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nin December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. \ndollar LIBOR actions.\nRussian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with \ninternational sanctions laws, which mandate the \nblocking of certain assets. These laws apply when \nassets associated with individuals, companies, products \nor services are within the scope of the sanctions. The \nFirm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia \nseeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, \nand is contractually excused from paying as a result of, \nrelevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and \nclaims filed against other financial institutions, Russian \ncourts have disregarded the parties’ contractual \nagreements concerning forum selection and did not \nrecognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not \nmaking payment. Russian courts have entered \njudgment against the Firm in a number of claims, \nincluding one for $439 million, and a judgment has been \nexecuted against assets held onshore by the Firm in \nRussia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the \ntotal amount of available assets that the Firm holds in \nRussia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian \ncourts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed \nwhile on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered \ninterim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, \namong other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, \nshares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of \nthe named defendants) pending a determination of \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n310\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\ncertain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has \nchallenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts \nand related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided \nfor by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If further \nclaims are enforced despite the actions taken by the \nFirm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the \nproper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia \ncould be seized in full, and certain client assets could \nalso be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from \ncomplying with its obligations.\nSEC Inquiries. In October 2024, the Firm entered into \nsettlements with the SEC to resolve inquiries related to, \namong other things, conflict disclosures concerning the \nselection of portfolio managers and the timing of the \nFirm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain \ninvestment vehicles that invest in third-party managed \nprivate funds and certain other matters. The resolutions \nrequired the Firm to pay a combined $151 million in civil \npenalties and voluntary payments to customers. The \nFirm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC \ninquiries concerning the aggregation of accounts for fee \nbilling and various other matters.\nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative \nclass actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions \npurporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed \nagainst the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its \ncurrent and former officers.  \nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical \ntrading practices by former employees in the precious \nmetals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct \nwhich were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the \nDOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary \nactivities that were separately the subject of a resolution \nbetween JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in \nNovember 2020. One of these shareholder derivative \nsuits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New \nYork in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty \nand unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical \ntrading practices and related conduct and fiduciary \nactivities which were the subject of the resolutions \ndescribed above. In December 2022, the court granted \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in \nJuly 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains \npending. \nA second shareholder derivative action relating to the \nhistorical trading practices and related conduct was \nfiled in the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York in December 2022. Defendants \nhave moved to dismiss the complaint.\nZelle Network Litigation. In December 2024, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a \ncomplaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), \nBank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that \nEWS and the defendant banks have failed to take \nsufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. \nThe defendants will file a response to the complaint.\n*     *     *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed \nabove, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named \nas defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial \nnumber of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it \nhas meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against \nit in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it \nintends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal \nproceedings may be initiated from time to time in the \nfuture.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred \nof its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In \naccordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for \ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related \nliability when it is probable that such a liability has been \nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably \nestimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal \nproceedings each quarter to assess its litigation \nreserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, \nupward or downward, as appropriate, based on \nmanagement’s best judgment after consultation with \ncounsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $740 million, \n$1.4 billion and $266 million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There \nis no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will \nnot need to be adjusted in the future. \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the \noutcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the \nclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or \nwhere the matters present novel legal theories, involve \na large number of parties or are in early stages of \ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what \nwill be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending \nmatters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the \neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences \nrelated to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, \nbased upon its current knowledge and after \nconsultation with counsel, consideration of the material \nlegal proceedings described above and after taking into \naccount its current litigation reserves and its estimated \naggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal \nproceedings currently pending against it should not \nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm’s \nconsolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, \nhowever, that in light of the uncertainties involved in \nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the \nultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly \nexceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a \nmatter will not have material reputational \nconsequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular \nmatter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating \nresults for a particular period, depending on, among \nother factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and \nthe level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n311\nNote 31 – International operations \nThe following table presents income statement and \nbalance sheet-related information for JPMorganChase \nby major international geographic area. The Firm \ndefines international activities for purposes of this \nfootnote presentation as business transactions that \ninvolve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the \ninformation presented below is based predominantly \non the domicile of the client, the location from which \nthe client relationship is managed, booking location or \nthe location of the trading desk. However, many of the \nFirm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses.\nAs the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, \nestimates and subjective assumptions have been \nmade to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. \nand international operations. These estimates and \nassumptions are consistent with the allocations used \nfor the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note \n32.\nThe Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented \nare not considered by management to be significant in \nrelation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-\nlived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, \n(in millions)\nRevenue(b)\nExpense(c)\nIncome before \nincome tax expense\nNet income\nTotal assets\n2024\nEurope/Middle East/Africa\n$ \n22,353 \n$ \n12,843 \n$ \n9,510 \n$ \n6,713 \n$ \n552,407 \n(d)\nAsia-Pacific"

As a result of the \nreorganization, the Firm has three reportable business \nsegments – Consumer & Community Banking, \nCommercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth \nManagement – with the remaining activities in \nCorporate. \nAdoption of accounting standard — Segment \nReporting — Improvements to Reportable Segment \nDisclosures: This guidance was adopted \nretrospectively for the Firm’s annual Consolidated \nFinancial Statements for the year ended December 31, \n2024. The adoption of this guidance requires additional \nreportable segment disclosures, primarily relating to \nsignificant segment expenses and the chief operating \ndecision maker (“CODM”). Adoption of this guidance did \nnot result in changes to the identification of the Firm’s \nreportable business segments, or of its CODM.  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. The business \nsegments are determined based on the products and \nservices provided, or the type of customer served, and \nthey reflect the manner in which financial information is \nevaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose \nmembers act collectively as the Firm’s CODM. Segment \nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to \nSegment & Corporate results in this footnote for a \nfurther discussion of JPMorganChase’s reportable \nbusiness segments and Corporate.\nThe following is a description of each of the Firm’s \nreportable business segments, and the products and \nservices that they provide to their respective client \nbases, as well as a description of Corporate activities.\nConsumer & Community Banking \nConsumer & Community Banking offers products and \nservices to consumers and small businesses through \nbank branches, ATMs, digital (including mobile and \nonline) and telephone banking. CCB is organized into \nBanking & Wealth Management (including Consumer \nBanking, Business Banking and J.P. Morgan Wealth \nManagement), Home Lending (including Home Lending \nProduction, Home Lending Servicing and Real Estate \nPortfolios) and Card Services & Auto. Banking & Wealth \nManagement offers deposit, investment and lending \nproducts, cash management, payments and services. \nHome Lending includes mortgage origination and \nservicing activities, as well as portfolios consisting of \nresidential mortgages and home equity loans. Card \nServices issues credit cards and offers travel services. \nAuto originates and services auto loans and leases. \nCommercial & Investment Bank\nThe Commercial & Investment Bank is comprised of the \nBanking & Payments and Markets & Securities Services \nbusinesses. These businesses offer investment \nbanking, lending, payments, market-making, financing, \ncustody and securities products and services to a \nglobal base of corporate and institutional clients. \nBanking & Payments offers products and services in all \nmajor capital markets, including advising on corporate \nstrategy and structure, capital-raising in equity and \ndebt markets, and loan origination and syndication. \nBanking & Payments also provides services that enable \nclients to manage payments globally across liquidity \nand account solutions, commerce solutions, clearing, \ntrade, and working capital. Markets & Securities \nServices includes Markets, which is a global market-\nmaker across products, including cash and derivative \ninstruments, and also offers sophisticated risk \nmanagement solutions, lending, prime brokerage, \nclearing and research. Markets & Securities Services \nalso includes Securities Services, a leading global \ncustodian that provides custody, fund services, liquidity \nand trading services, and data solutions products.  \nAsset & Wealth Management\nAsset & Wealth Management, with client assets of $5.9 \ntrillion, is a global leader in investment and wealth \nmanagement. \nAsset Management \nOffers multi-asset investment management solutions \nacross equities, fixed income, alternatives and money \nmarket funds to institutional and retail investors \nproviding for a broad range of clients’ investment \nneeds.\nGlobal Private Bank\nProvides retirement products and services, brokerage, \ncustody, estate planning, lending, deposits and \ninvestment management to high net worth clients.\nThe majority of AWM’s client assets are in actively \nmanaged portfolios.\nCorporate\nCorporate consists of Treasury and Chief Investment \nOffice (“CIO”) and Other Corporate. Treasury and CIO is \npredominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, \nreporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, \ncapital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange \nrisks. \nOther Corporate includes staff functions and expense \nthat is centrally managed as well as certain Firm \ninitiatives and activities not solely aligned to a specific \nLOB. The major Other Corporate functions include Real \nEstate, Technology, Legal, Corporate Finance, Human \nResources, Internal Audit, Risk Management, \nCompliance, Control Management, Corporate \nResponsibility and various Other Corporate groups.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n313\nDescription of business segment reporting \nmethodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are \nintended to present each segment as if it were a stand-\nalone business. The management reporting process \nthat derives business segment results includes the \nallocation of certain income and expense items. The \nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions, \nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for \nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements \nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also \nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on \nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide \nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the Firm \nand its investors and analysts in assessing \nperformance. \nRevenue sharing \nWhen business segments or businesses within each \nsegment join efforts to sell products and services to \nthe Firm’s clients and customers, the participating \nbusinesses may agree to share revenue from those \ntransactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the \nsegment responsible for the related product or \nservice, with allocations to the other segments or \nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment \nand business results reflect these revenue-sharing \nagreements.\nExpense allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by \nCorporate support units, or another business segment, \nthe costs of those services are allocated to the \nrespective business segments. The expense is \ngenerally allocated based on the actual cost and use of \nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and \ninvestments related to Corporate that are not currently \nutilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business \nsegments and are retained in Corporate. Expense \nretained in Corporate generally includes costs that \nwould not be incurred if the segments were stand-\nalone businesses, and other items not solely aligned \nwith a particular reportable business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which \nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the \nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary \ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the \ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets \nand liabilities and off-balance sheet products. \nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions \nutilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect \neconomic conditions and other factors, which may \nimpact the allocation of net interest income to the \nsegments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the \nFirm updated its FTP with respect to consumer \ndeposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding \nbenefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that \nis fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s \nnet interest income.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs \nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain \nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages \nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign \nexchange rate movements related to the transferred \nrisk in its results.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the \ncredit spread component of outstanding unsecured \nlong-term debt and preferred stock dividends is \nallocated to the reportable business segments, while \nthe balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The \nmethodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-\nterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the \nbusiness segments is aligned with the relevant \nregulatory capital requirements and funding needs of \nthe LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of \nunsecured long-term debt is included in a business \nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is \nreduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a \nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common \nequity.\nCapital allocation\nEach LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking \ninto consideration a variety of factors including capital \nlevels of similarly rated peers and applicable \nregulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and \ninternal targets for expected returns are established \nas key measures of an LOB’s performance.\nThe Firm’s current equity allocation methodology \nincorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB \nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well \nas a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress \nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions, \njudgments and methodologies used to allocate capital \nare reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to \nthe LOBs and Corporate may change. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n314\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nSegment & Corporate results \nThe following table provides a summary of results for \nthe Firm’s reportable business segments and \nCorporate activities as of or for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, on a managed \nbasis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts \nwith the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes \ncertain reclassifications to present total net revenue \nfor the Firm as a whole (and for each of the reportable \nbusiness segments and Corporate) on an FTE basis. \nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive \ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in \nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable \ninvestments and securities. This allows management \nto assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-\nyear arising from both taxable and tax-exempt \nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related \nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax \nexpense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact \non net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by \nthe each of the LOBs and Corporate.\nThe Operating Committee reviews segment results \nincluding net interest income, noninterest revenue, \nnoninterest expense, provision for credit losses and \nnet income on a managed basis. The Operating \nCommittee uses these measures to evaluate segment \nperformance and to make key operating decisions, \nincluding resource and capital allocations.\nSegment & Corporate results and reconciliation\n(a)\n(Table continued on next page)\nAs of or for the year ended \nDecember 31, \n(in millions, except ratios)\nConsumer & Community Banking\nCommercial & Investment Bank\nAsset & Wealth Management\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNoninterest revenue\n$ \n16,649 \n$ \n15,118 \n$ \n14,886 \n(e)\n$ \n48,253 \n$ \n43,809 \n$ \n39,538 \n(b)\n$ \n15,023 \n$ \n13,560 \n$ \n12,507 \nNet interest income"

The reimbursements were $5.0 billion, $13.2 billion, \nand $11.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 \nand 2022, respectively.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n318\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNote 34 – Business combinations\nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorganChase acquired certain \nassets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic \nBank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. \nThe acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, \nwhich represents the excess of the estimated fair value \nof the net assets acquired above the purchase price. \nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition \nconstitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. \nAccordingly, the initial recognition of the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed were generally \nmeasured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, \n2023. The determination of those fair values required \nmanagement to make certain market-based \nassumptions about expected future cash flows, \ndiscount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of \nthe acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value \nestimates of the assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed provide a reasonable basis for determining \nthe estimated bargain purchase gain. \nThe First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary \nestimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The \nfinal bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects \nadjustments of $103 million and $63 million for the \nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, made during the one-year measurement \nperiod, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize \nmanagement's fair value estimates for the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, \n2024, certain matters related to the final settlement \nremained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. \nOn January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement \nwith the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding \nitems. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a \npayment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, \n2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, \nwhich will result in a gain of approximately \n$600 million to be recorded in other income in the first \nquarter of 2025.\nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the \nFirm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss \nagreements with respect to certain loans and lending-\nrelated commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the \nCommercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the \nSingle-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The \nCSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu \nbasis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery \nperiod for certain acquired commercial loans and \nother real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of \ncredit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for \ncertain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real \nproperty or shares in cooperative property \nconstituting a primary residence. The indemnification \nassets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and \nSFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total \nassets acquired.\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase \nissued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC \n(the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money \nNote bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is \nsecured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase \nMoney Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder.\nThe Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First \nRepublic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion \nof deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. \nbanks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectively \nsettled as part of the acquisition and the associated \nallowance for credit losses was released upon closing. \nThe Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 \nbillion of deposits to the consortium of banks, \nincluding accrued interest through the payment date \non May 9, 2023."

Other liabilities include the related \ntax-oriented investment liabilities of $669 million and lease liabilities of $748 million. \nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the \nfollowing assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss \nagreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. \nFor further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Notes 2 and 3 for fair \nvalue measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and Note 28 for \nlending-related commitments.\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles\nCore deposit and certain wealth management \ncustomer relationship intangibles were acquired as \npart of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit \nintangible of $1.3 billion was valued by discounting \nestimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining \nuseful life of the deposits using the favorable source of \nfunds method. The after-tax cost savings were \nestimated based on the difference between the cost of \nmaintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost \nof next best alternative funding sources available to \nmarket participants. The customer relationship \nintangibles of $180 million were valued by discounting \nestimated after-tax earnings over their remaining \nuseful lives using the multi-period excess earnings \nmethod. Both intangible asset valuations utilized \nassumptions that the Firm believes a market \nparticipant would use to estimate fair values, such as \ngrowth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well \nas related costs to service the relationships, and \ndiscount rates. The core deposit and customer \nrelationship intangibles are amortized over a projected \nperiod of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. \nRefer to Note 15 for further discussion on other \nintangible assets.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n320\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nIndemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements\nThe indemnification assets represent forecasted \nrecoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-\nloss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery \nperiods. The indemnification assets were recorded at \nfair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance \nsheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the \nindemnification assets were estimated based on the \ntiming of the forecasted losses underlying the related \nallowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly \nremeasurement of the indemnification assets is based \non changes in the amount and timing of forecasted \nlosses in the allowance for credit losses associated \nwith the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other \nincome. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be \nrequired to make a payment to the FDIC upon \ntermination of the shared-loss agreements based on \nthe level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-\nloss assets. The estimated potential future payment is \nreflected as contingent consideration as part of the \npurchase price consideration.\nPurchase Money Note and FHLB advances\nThe Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term \ndebt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair \nvalue of the Purchase Money Note was estimated \nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology and \nincorporated estimated market discount rates. \nThe FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are \nrecorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term \ndebt.

The \nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on \nthe interest rate charged during the introductory \nperiod. This introductory rate is usually significantly \nbelow the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is \ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the \nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest rate \ncharged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate \nand adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. \nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover \ninterest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid \ninterest is deferred and added to the principal balance \nof the loan.

Key differences in the calculation of \ncredit risk RWA between the Standardized and \nAdvanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, \ncredit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches \nwhich largely rely on the use of internal credit models \nand parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, \ncredit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-\nweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type \nand asset class.

You should refer to our certificate of incorporation and to the Certificate of \nDesignations, Powers, Preferences and Rights relating to each series of Listed Preferred Stock (as defined below), which \nwe refer to herein as a certificate of designations, for the complete terms of that series of preferred stock. Copies of our \ncertificate of incorporation and the certificate of designations for each series of Listed Preferred Stock are incorporated by \nreference as Exhibits to the Form 10-K. We encourage you to read our certificate of incorporation and the relevant \ncertificates of designations for additional information.  \nAuthorized Shares\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder action, to issue up \nto 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1 par value per share, which we refer herein to as preferred stock, in one or \nmore series, and to determine the voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or \nother special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each series. We may amend our certificate of \nincorporation to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of preferred stock in a manner permitted by our \ncertificate of incorporation and the DGCL. \nOutstanding Preferred Stock\nAs of the filing date of the Form 10-K, we have 11 series of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The shares of each \nseries of our preferred stock are represented by depositary shares, with each depositary share representing a fractional \ninterest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series. Of the 11 series of our issued and outstanding preferred stock, \ndepositary shares representing the following six series of preferred stock are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, with each depositary share representing a 1/400th interest in a share of preferred stock \nof the relevant series:\na.\n5.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD; \nb.\n6.00% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE; \nc.\n4.75 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series GG;\nd.\n4.55% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series JJ;\ne.\n4.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series LL; and\nf.\n4.20% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM.\nWe refer to the above six series of preferred stock herein collectively as the “Listed Preferred Stock”.\nThe Listed Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable. \nThe terms of the depositary shares are summarized below under “Description of Depositary Shares”.\nRanking\nThe Listed Preferred Stock ranks, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or \nwinding-up, on a parity with any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock and senior to \nour common stock and to any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock. The Listed Preferred \nStock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nDividend Rights\nHolders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly \nauthorized committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates described below under “Specific Terms \nof Listed Preferred Stock”. We will pay each dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register on \nrecord dates determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on the Listed \nPreferred Stock are noncumulative. If a dividend is not declared on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, because the \ndividends are noncumulative, then the right of holders of that series to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have \nno obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend \nperiod.\nWe may not declare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, \nequally with or junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for \npayment, or we contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends on that series of Listed \nPreferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on a particular series \nof Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that series, all \ndividends declared and paid upon the shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred \nstock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the that series will be declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating \nthe pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, we will allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the \nthen-current dividends due on shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of any series of non-cumulative \npreferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and \nunpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock and (ii) in the case of any series of cumulative preferred stock \nranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and \nunpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock.\nIn addition, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Listed Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or a \nsum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment in respect of the applicable most recently completed \ndividend period, with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock:\na.\n no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed \nPreferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum \nsufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our \ncommon stock or upon any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or \nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, and\nb.\nno common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally with that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends \nor upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any \nconsideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of \nany such capital stock) by us, except:\ni.\nby conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;\nii.\nas a result of reclassification into capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;\niii.\nthrough the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of shares of capital stock \nranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock or, in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that \nListed Preferred Stock, through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other \nshares of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;             \niv.\nin the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock, pursuant to pro rata offers \nto purchase all or a pro rata portion of the shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and such capital stock \nranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;\nv.\nin connection with the satisfaction of our obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary \ncourse prior to the beginning of the most recently completed dividend period; or\nvi.\nany purchase, redemption or other acquisition of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred \nStock pursuant to any of our or our subsidiaries’ employee, consultant or director incentive or benefit \nplans or arrangements (including any employment, severance or consulting arrangements) adopted \nbefore or after the issuance of that Listed Preferred Stock).\nHowever, the foregoing will not restrict our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to engage in underwriting, \nstabilization, market-making or similar transactions in our capital stock in the ordinary course of business. Subject to the \nconditions described above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be \ndetermined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our \ncommon stock and any other capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock from time to time \nout of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to \nparticipate in those dividends.\nAs used herein, “junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to our common stock and any other class \nor series of our capital stock over which the Listed Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or \nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; “parity preferred stock” and “on a parity \nwith a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity \nwith the shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or \nwinding-up, or both, as the context may require; and “senior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to \nany class or series of our capital stock that ranks senior to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to \ndividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require.\nWe will compute the amount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number \nof dividend periods in a year, except that the amount of dividends payable for any period greater or less than a full \ndividend period, other than the initial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve \n30-day months and, for any period less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts \nresulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.\nRights Upon Liquidation \nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series of Listed Preferred \nStock will be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the \namount of $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, \nbefore we make any distribution of assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares \nranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock of such series. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential \namounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets.\nIf, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the amounts payable with \nrespect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, and any stock having the same rank as that series, the holders of \nthat series and of that other stock will share ratably in any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full \nrespective distributions to which they are entitled. For any series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the sale of all or \nsubstantially all of our property or business, nor our merger or consolidation into or with any other entity will be \nconsidered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary of or involuntary, of us.\nBecause we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and our stockholders, including the holders \nof the Listed Preferred Stock, to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon that subsidiary’s liquidation, \ndissolution, winding-up or recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the \nextent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.\nHolders of the Listed Preferred Stock are subordinate to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and \nour assets, including in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. In \naddition, holders of the Listed Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the \nevent that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.\nRedemption \nWe may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock on the dates and at the redemption prices set forth below under \n“Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. In addition, we may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock in whole, but \nnot in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared \nand unpaid dividends, following the occurrence of a capital treatment event. For these purposes, “capital treatment event” \nmeans the good faith determination by JPMorganChase that, as a result of any:\na.\namendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or \nany political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of \nany shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock;\nb.\nproposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of \nany shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock; or\nc.\nofficial administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement \ninterpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance \nof any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock,\nthere is more than an insubstantial risk that JPMorganChase will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full \nliquidation amount of all shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock then outstanding as “additional Tier 1 capital” (or \nits equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, \nas then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of such series of Listed Preferred Stock is outstanding. \nRedemption of any Listed Preferred Stock may be subject to our receipt of any required approvals from the Federal \nReserve Board or any other regulatory authority.\nIf we elect to redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, we will provide notice by first class mail, postage \nprepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed. Such mailing will be at least 30 days and not \nmore than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice so mailed will be conclusively presumed to have been \nduly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in \nsuch notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of the series designated for redemption will not affect the \nvalidity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of that series. Each notice of redemption will state:\na.\nthe redemption date;\nb.\nthe number of shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held \nby such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;\nc.\nthe redemption price;\nd.\nthe place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the \nredemption price; and\ne.\nthat dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the series of Listed Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository \nTrust Company, or “DTC”, we may give such notice in any manner permitted or required by DTC. For each series of Listed \nPreferred Stock, neither the holders of a series nor the holders of the related depositary shares have the right to require \nredemption of such series of Listed Preferred Stock.\nIn the case of any redemption of only part of the shares a series of Listed Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the \nshares of the series to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of that series in proportion \nto the number of shares held by such holders or by lot. From and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to \naccumulate on the shares of Listed Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date and all rights of the \nholders of those shares, except the right to receive the redemption price, will cease.\nIn the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, on any series of Listed \nPreferred Stock, we may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series, \nexcept by a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series.\nPreemptive and Conversion Rights\nThe Listed Preferred Stock is not subject to any preemptive rights and is not convertible into property or shares of any \nother class or series of our capital stock. \nDepositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar\nComputershare Inc. is the depositary, transfer agent and registrar for each series of the Listed Preferred Stock and the \nrelated depositary shares.\nVoting Rights\nExcept as indicated below or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are \nnot entitled to vote. Each share of Listed Preferred Stock a series is entitled to one vote on matters on which holders of \nthat series are entitled to vote. The voting power of each series of Listed Preferred Stock depends on the number of \nshares in that series, and not on the aggregate liquidation preference or initial offering price of the shares of that series.\nIf, at any time or times, the equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, for any series \nof Listed Preferred Stock has not been paid, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be \nautomatically increased by two and the holders of each outstanding series of Listed Preferred Stock with such voting \nrights, together with holders of such other shares of any other class or series of parity preferred stock outstanding at the \ntime upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, which we refer to as “voting parity stock,” \nvoting together as a class, will be entitled to elect those additional two directors, which we refer to as “preferred directors,” \nat that annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full dividends have been paid for at \nleast four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that time such right will terminate, except as expressly provided in \nthe applicable certificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of \nthe Listed Preferred Stock and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the preferred \ndirectors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in office will terminate \nimmediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected. Any \npreferred director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the \naffirmative vote of the holders of shares of the Listed Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with the holders of shares \nof voting parity stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy \ncreated by removal with or without cause may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any \npreferred director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining preferred director may choose a \nsuccessor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.\nSo long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remains outstanding, we will not, without the \naffirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series and any voting parity stock, voting \ntogether as a class, authorize, create or issue any capital stock ranking senior to that series as to dividends or upon \nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock \nor issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock. So \nlong as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative \nvote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series, amend, alter or repeal any provision of the applicable \ncertificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation, including by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to \nadversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of that series.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special \nrights of any series of Listed Preferred Stock:\na.\nany increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock, or any increase or \ndecrease in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the authorization, creation and issuance of \nother classes or series of capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to that series of Listed \nPreferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;\nb.\na merger or consolidation of JPMorganChase with or into another entity in which the shares of that series remain \noutstanding; and\nc.\na merger or consolidation of JPMorganChase with or into another entity in which the shares of the that series are \nconverted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly, \ncontrolling such surviving entity and such new preference securities have powers, preferences and special rights \nthat are not materially less favorable than that series;\nprovided that if the amendment would adversely affect such series but not any other series of preferred stock \noutstanding, then the amendment will only need to be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the series \nof Listed Preferred Stock adversely affected.\nIn exercising the voting rights described above or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by us, each \nshare of Listed Preferred Stock with respect to a series will be entitled to one vote (equivalent to 1/400\nth of a vote per \nrelevant depositary share).\nIf we redeem or call for redemption all outstanding shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock and irrevocably deposit in \ntrust sufficient funds to effect such redemption, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would \notherwise be required or upon which the holders of such series will be entitled to vote will be effected, the voting \nprovisions described above will not apply.\nOur board of directors may also from time to time, without notice to or consent of holders of a series of Listed Preferred \nStock, issue additional shares of such series. Delaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right \nto vote separately as a class on any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of \ndesignations) that would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or \ndecrease the par value of such class or adversely affect the powers, preferences and special rights of the shares of \npreferred stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as permitted by law, our certificate of incorporation provides that any \nincrease or decrease in our authorized capital stock may be adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of capital stock \nrepresenting not less than a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our capital stock \nentitled to vote. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one or \nmore series of preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class of preferred stock, \nonly the shares of the series so affected will be considered a separate class for purposes of this vote on the amendment. \nThis right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in our certificate of incorporation (including any \ncertificate of designations).\nUnder regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any series of our preferred stock become \nentitled to vote for the election of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be \ndeemed a “class of voting securities.” In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a holder of 5% or more if that \nholder would also be considered to exercise a “controlling influence” over JPMorganChase, may then be subject to \nregulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any other bank \nholding company may be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5% or \nmore of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to provide notice to the \nFederal Reserve Board prior to acquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.\nDescription of Depositary Shares\nThe following summary of the terms of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock is not \ncomplete. You should refer to each of the deposit agreements among us, the depositary, and the holders from time to time \nof the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares relating to each series of the Listed Preferred Stock for the \ncomplete terms of those depositary shares. Each of those deposit agreements has been filed as an exhibit to a Current \nReport on Form 8-K filed in connection with the issuance of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed \nPreferred Stock.\nGeneral. Each depositary share represents a 1/400\nth interest in a share of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, and \nis evidenced by depositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited \nshares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement \nrelating to that series of Listed Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of each deposit agreement, the depositary shares are \nentitled to all the powers, preferences and special rights of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, as applicable, in \nproportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Listed Preferred Stock those depositary shares represent.\nDividends and Other Distributions. Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/400\nth of \nthe dividend declared and payable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock.\nThe depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred \nStock to the holders of record of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by \neach holder. In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the \nholders of record of the depositary receipts as nearly as practicable in proportion to the number of depositary shares held \nby each holder, unless the depositary determines that this distribution is not feasible, in which case the depositary may, \nwith our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of the property and \ndistribution of the net proceeds of that sale to the holders of the depositary receipts. \nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the \ncorresponding record dates for the related shares of Listed Preferred Stock. \nThe amount paid as dividends or otherwise distributable by the depositary with respect to the depositary shares or the \nunderlying Listed Preferred Stock will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on \naccount of taxes or other governmental charges. \nRedemption of Depositary Shares. If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the \ncorresponding depositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the \nredemption of the Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be \n1/400\nth of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Listed Preferred Stock, plus any declared and \nunpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends. \nIf we redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same \nredemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Listed Preferred Stock so redeemed. \nIf we redeem less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary will select pro rata or by lot those \ndepositary shares to be redeemed. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary \nreceipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock \nand the related depositary shares. \nThe redemption of depositary shares that are held in book-entry form through DTC will be effected in accordance with the \napplicable procedures of DTC. \nVoting the Listed Preferred Stock. Because each depositary share represents a 1/400\nth interest in a share of Listed \nPreferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400\nth of a vote per depositary share under those \nlimited circumstances in which holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote. \nWhen the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled \nto vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares \nrelating to that Listed Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the \nsame date as the record date for the applicable Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of \nthe Listed Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will \nvote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it \nreceives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as \ninstructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing \nthe Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares.\nWithdrawal of Listed Preferred Stock. Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary \narrangement upon surrender of depositary receipts at the depositary’s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and \nfees provided for in the deposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of \ndepositary receipts will receive the appropriate number of shares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such \ndepositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn; if a holder holds an amount other than a \nwhole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will deliver along with the withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred \nStock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed \nPreferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive depositary shares.\nForm and Notices. Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the \ndepositary shares representing that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC. The \ndepositary will forward to the holders of depositary shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are \ndelivered to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock.\nAmendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement. We and the depositary may amend any form of depositary \nreceipt evidencing depositary shares and any provision of any deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary \nshares. However, any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares \nrepresenting a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock or would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights \ngranted to holders of that underlying Listed Preferred Stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation will not be \neffective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the related depositary shares \nthen outstanding.

It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February, 2016 \n(as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial \nCompany LLC, as issuer (“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorganChase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and \nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to \nthe Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2016 Indenture for additional information.\nGeneral\nThe Alerian ETNs were originally issued on January 30, 2024 and are part of a series of JPMorgan Financial’s debt \nsecurities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A Notes”) that JPMorgan Financial may issue under \nthe 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series A Notes, please see the section titled “— \nDescription of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC’s Callable Fixed Rate Notes Due June 10, 2032, Fully and \nUnconditionally Guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. — General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.  \nThe Alerian ETNs are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by JPMorganChase, the Guarantor. The Alerian ETNs will rank pari passu with all of JPMorgan \nFinancial’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Alerian ETNs will \nrank pari passu with all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Alerian ETNs do \nnot guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or upon early redemption or repurchase.  Any payment on \nthe Alerian ETNs is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the Alerian ETNs, and JPMorgan \nChase & Co., as guarantor of the Alerian ETNs.\nThe Alerian ETNs are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other \ngovernmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\nUnless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Alerian ETNs are registered on \nthe books that JPMorgan Financial or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintains for this purpose, and \nnot those who own beneficial interests in the Alerian ETNs (registered in street name or otherwise).\nKey Terms of the Alerian ETNs\nGeneral\nPrincipal Amount: $26 per Alerian ETN (equal to the Initial VWAP Level divided by ten, rounded to the nearest cent).\nIndex:  The return on the Alerian ETNs is linked to the performance of the Alerian MLP Index\n® (Bloomberg ticker: AMZ), \nwhich we refer to as the Index, as measured by its VWAP level, and to cash distributions on its components. See “— Terms \nRelating to Closing Intrinsic Note Value — VWAP Level” below.  \nThe Index measures the composite performance of energy-oriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, that earn the \nmajority of their cash flows from qualified activities involving energy commodities (the “Index Components”) using a \ncapped, float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted methodology.  MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the \nexploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural \nresource.  The Index is calculated and maintained by VettaFi LLC (“VettaFi”).  \nCoupon Payments:  For each Alerian ETN a holder holds on a Coupon Record Date, the holder will receive on the \nimmediately following Coupon Payment Date an amount in cash equal to the Coupon Amount, if any, as of the immediately \npreceding Coupon Valuation Date.\nCoupon Amount:  The Coupon Amount as of any Coupon Valuation Date will equal:\na.\nthe Reference Distribution Amount with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, minus \nb.\nthe Accrued Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date,\nprovided that the Coupon Amount will not be less than $0.\nIf the Reference Distribution Amount on a Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Investor Fee on that Coupon \nValuation Date, an amount equal to the excess of the Accrued Investor Fee over the Reference Distribution Amount (the \n“Investor Fee Shortfall”) will be included in the Accrued Investor Fee with respect to the next Coupon Valuation Date.\nThe Accrued Investor Fee will reduce each Coupon Amount. In addition, no Coupon Payment will be payable with respect \nto a Coupon Valuation Date if the Reference Distribution Amount is less than the Accrued Investor Fee, even if that \nReference Distribution Amount is positive. The holders are not guaranteed any Coupon Payments.\nThe Coupon Amount is subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs as described under \n“— Split or Reverse Split of the Alerian ETNs” below.\nPayment at Maturity:  For each Alerian ETN, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed, holders will receive at maturity a \ncash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Final \nValuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment at maturity will be $0.\nIssuer Redemption:  On any Business Day on or after July 26, 2024, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the \nAlerian ETNs, in whole or in part. If the Issuer exercises its right to redeem the Alerian ETNs prior to maturity, for each \nAlerian ETN that is redeemed, holders will receive on the Redemption Settlement Date a cash payment equal to the \nClosing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Redemption Valuation Date. If \nthat amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early redemption will be $0.\nWeekly Repurchase:  On a weekly basis, holders may request that we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs \n(subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs) if holders comply with the required \nprocedures, subject to a repurchase fee of 0.125%. For each Alerian ETN that is repurchased, holders will receive on the \nrelevant Repurchase Date a cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement \nPeriod with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date minus the Repurchase Fee Amount with respect to the Repurchase \nValuation Date. \nIf the amount calculated above is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early repurchase will be $0.\nTerms Relating to Closing Intrinsic Note Value\nClosing Intrinsic Note Value:  As of any date of determination, an amount per Alerian ETN equal to:\na.\nthe Principal Amount, multiplied by the Index Ratio as of that date, plus\nb.\nthe Coupon Amount as of that date, calculated as if that date were a Coupon Valuation Date (the “Stub Coupon \nAmount”), minus\nc.\nany Investor Fee Shortfall determined in calculating that Stub Coupon Amount.\nIn addition, if the Coupon Ex-Date with respect to the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation \nDate has not yet occurred, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value will also include that Coupon Amount (an “Unpaid Coupon \nAmount”).\nFor purposes of determining the Closing Intrinsic Note Value over any Measurement Period, the Index Ratio is determined \nbased on the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels over that Measurement Period, and the date of determination for \npurposes of determining the Coupon Amount, any Investor Fee Shortfall and any Unpaid Coupon Amount is the final day \nof that Measurement Period.\nThe Closing Intrinsic Note Value is not the closing price or any other trading price of the Alerian ETNs in the secondary \nmarket and is not intended as a price or quotation, or as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of the Alerian ETNs \nor as a recommendation to transact in the Alerian ETNs at the stated price. The trading price of the Alerian ETNs at any \ntime may vary significantly from the Closing Intrinsic Note Value due to, among other things, imbalances of supply and \ndemand (including as a result of any decision of ours to issue, stop issuing or resume issuing additional Alerian ETNs), lack \nof liquidity, transaction costs, credit considerations and bid-offer spreads.\nIf the Reference Distribution Amount used to calculate the Stub Coupon Amount on any Index Business Day is less than \nthe Accrued Investor Fee used to calculate that Stub Coupon Amount, the resulting Investor Fee Shortfall will be deducted \nin calculating the Closing Intrinsic Note Value on that Index Business Day. Accordingly, the payment at maturity or upon \nearly repurchase or redemption will be reduced by the amount of any Investor Fee Shortfall reflected in the relevant \nClosing Intrinsic Note Value.\nIndex Ratio:  As of any date of determination, the Index Ratio is equal to:\nVWAP Level\nInitial VWAP Level\nprovided that, solely for purposes of determining the Closing Intrinsic Note Value in connection with any payment at \nmaturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the Index Ratio determined over the relevant Measurement Period is \nequal to:\nFinal VWAP Level\nInitial VWAP Level\nInitial VWAP Level: 260.0267 which is the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels determined over a period of five Index \nBusiness Days ending on the Inception Date.\nFinal VWAP Level:  With respect to a Measurement Period, the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels on the five Index \nBusiness Days in that Measurement Period, as calculated by the Note Calculation Agent.\nMeasurement Period:  With respect to the Final Valuation Date or any Repurchase Valuation Date or Redemption \nValuation Date, the five Index Business Days starting from and including the Final Valuation Date or that Repurchase \nValuation Date or Redemption Valuation Date, as applicable (or, if that day is not an Index Business Day, the five Index \nBusiness Days immediately following that day). \nThe Measurement Period is subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event and as described under “— \nPostponement of an Averaging Date.”\nVWAP Level:  On any Index Business Day, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent, the sum of the products for each \nIndex Component of:\na.\nthe VWAP of that Index Component as of that day; and \nb.\nthe Index Units of that Index Component as of that day, divided by the Index Divisor as of that day. \nThe calculation of the VWAP Level may be modified in circumstances described under “— Postponement of an Averaging \nDate” and “— Discontinuation of an Index; Alternation of Method of Calculation” below. The official closing level of the \nIndex may vary significantly from the VWAP Level.\nVWAP:  With respect to each Index Component, as of any date of determination, the volume-weighted average price of \none share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent based on the Primary Exchange for \nthat Index Component. \nIndex Units:  With respect to each Index Component, as of any date of determination, the number of units of that Index \nComponent included in the Index for purposes of the calculation of the official level of the Index by the Index Calculation \nAgent. \nIndex Divisor:  As of any date of determination, the divisor used in the calculation of the official level of the Index by the \nIndex Calculation Agent. \nInception Date:  January 26, 2024\nInitial Issue Date:  January 30, 2024\nFinal Valuation Date: January 20, 2044\nMaturity Date: January 28, 2044. The Maturity Date is subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event \nand as described under “— Postponement of a Payment Date” below.\nTerms Relating to Coupon Payments\nAccrued Investor Fee:  The Accrued Investor Fee accrues at a rate of 0.85% per annum each day. In addition, the Accrued \nInvestor Fee carries forward any shortfall if the Reference Distribution Amount determined in connection with any Coupon \nPayment is less than the Accrued Investor Fee at that time.  \nWith respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, the Accrued Investor Fee is an amount equal to:\na.\nthe Periodic Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, plus\nb.\nthe Investor Fee Shortfall, if any, as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date, if any.\nPeriodic Investor Fee:  With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, an amount equal to the product of\na.\nthe investor fee of 0.85% per annum; \nb.\nthe Principal Amount multiplied by the Index Ratio as of the immediately preceding Index Business Day that is not \na Disrupted Day for any Index Component; and \nc.\nthe day count fraction, calculated using a 30/360 day count convention as described under “— Additional Terms \n— Day Count Fraction” below.\nReference Distribution Amount:  With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, an amount equal to the sum of the gross \ncash distributions that a Reference Holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of each Index Component held \nby that Reference Holder on the “record date” with respect to that Index Component, for those cash distributions whose \n“ex-dividend date” occurs during the Coupon Accrual Period for that Coupon Valuation Date. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to cash distributions for an Index Component that are scheduled to be paid \nprior to the applicable Coupon Ex-Date, if the issuer of that Index Component fails to pay the distribution to holders of that \nIndex Component by the scheduled payment date for that distribution, that distribution will be assumed to be zero for the \npurposes of calculating the applicable Reference Distribution Amount.\nReference Holder:  As of any date of determination, a hypothetical holder of a number of shares of each Index Component \nequal to:\na.\nthe Index Units of that Index Component as of that date, divided by \nb.\nthe Index Divisor as of that date multiplied by 10,\nprovided that solely for purposes of determining the Reference Distribution Amount included in any Stub Coupon Amount \npayable at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the Reference Holder will be deemed to hold four-fifths, \nthree-fifths, two-fifths and one-fifth of the shares of each Index Component it would otherwise hold on the second, third, \nfourth and fifth Index Business Days, respectively, in the relevant Measurement Period.\nThe Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference Distribution Amount and the Reference Holder are \neach subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs as described under “— Split or \nReverse Split of the Alerian ETNs” below.\nCoupon Accrual Period:  With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, the period from but excluding the immediately \npreceding Coupon Valuation Date (or, in the case of the first Coupon Valuation Date, from but excluding November 15, \n2023) to and including that Coupon Valuation Date. \nCoupon Valuation Date:  The first Index Business Day occurring on or after the 15th of February, May, August and \nNovember of each calendar year during the term of the Alerian ETNs, beginning on February 15, 2024.\nCoupon Ex-Date:  With respect to a Coupon Amount, the first Exchange Business Day on which the Alerian ETNs trade \nwithout the right to receive that Coupon Amount. Under current NYSE Arca practice, the Coupon Ex-Date will generally be \nthe first Exchange Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Coupon Record Date; however, beginning May 28, \n2024, under NYSE Arca practice, the Coupon Ex-Date is expected to generally be the applicable Coupon Record Date. For \npurposes of this paragraph, “Exchange Business Day” means any day on which the primary exchange or market for \ntrading of the Alerian ETNs is scheduled to be open for trading.\nCoupon Record Date:  The 9th Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date.\nCoupon Payment Date:  The 15th Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date, subject to postponement in \nthe event of a market disruption event as described under “— Postponement of a Payment Date” below.\nTerms Relating to Issuer Redemption\nEarly Redemption:  On any Business Day on or after July 26, 2024, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Alerian \nETNs, in whole or in part. If the Issuer exercises its right to redeem the Alerian ETNs, the Issuer will deliver an irrevocable \nredemption notice (the “Redemption Notice”) to DTC (the holder of the master note evidencing the Alerian ETNs) at least \nfive Business Days prior to the Redemption Valuation Date specified in the Redemption Notice. If fewer than all the Alerian \nETNs are to be redeemed, the Issuer will specify in the Redemption Notice the principal amount of the Alerian ETNs to be \nredeemed, and the Trustee will select the Alerian ETNs to be redeemed pro rata, by lot or in such manner as it deems \nappropriate and fair.\nPayment upon Early Redemption:  If the Issuer exercises its right to redeem any Alerian ETNs prior to maturity, for each \nAlerian ETNs selected for redemption by the Trustee, holders will receive on the Redemption Settlement Date a cash \npayment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the \nRedemption Valuation Date.

The Issuer may from time to time, in its sole discretion, reduce the minimum number \nof the Alerian ETNs required for an early repurchase on a consistent basis for all holders of the Alerian ETNs, but the Issuer \nis under no obligation to do so.\nPayment upon Early Repurchase:  Subject to holders’ compliance with the required procedures, for each Alerian ETN that \nis repurchased, holders will receive on the relevant Repurchase Date a cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note \nValue determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date minus the Repurchase \nFee Amount with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon \nearly redemption will be $0.\nRepurchase Fee Amount:  With respect to any Repurchase Valuation Date, an amount per Alerian ETN in cash equal to \n0.125% of the Closing Intrinsic Note Value with respect to that Repurchase Valuation Date (but excluding any Unpaid \nCoupon Amount included in that Closing Intrinsic Note Value). \nRepurchase Valuation Date:  The last Index Business Day of each week, generally Friday. \nRepurchase Date:  Unless otherwise specified in the Issuer’s acknowledgement, the day that follows the final day in the \nMeasurement Period with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date by a number of Business Days corresponding to the \nstandard settlement cycle, which is currently two Business Days and which is expected to be one Business Day beginning \nMay 28, 2024.

Morgan Securities LLC \n(“JPMS”), one of our and JPMorgan Financial’s affiliates, will act as the Note Calculation Agent. Solactive AG will act as the \nVWAP Calculation Agent and the Published ETN Value Calculation Agent. We and JPMorgan Financial may appoint a \ndifferent Note Calculation Agent, VWAP Calculation Agent or Published ETN Value Calculation Agent from time to time \nwithout holders’ consent and without notifying holders.\nThe Note Calculation Agent will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Alerian ETNs, \nincluding calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Alerian ETNs and the assumptions used to \ndetermine the pricing of the Alerian ETNs, other than determinations to be made by the VWAP Calculation Agent. The \nVWAP Calculation Agent will determine the VWAP Level and the VWAP of each Index Component on each Index Business \nDay, except as described below under “— Postponement of an Averaging Date.” The Published ETN Value Calculation \nAgent is responsible for calculating the Daily Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value and the Interim \nCoupon or Shortfall Amount for purposes of publication.  All determinations made by the Note Calculation Agent, the \nVWAP Calculation Agent or the Published ETN Value Calculation Agent will be at the sole discretion of the Note \nCalculation Agent, the VWAP Calculation Agent or the Published ETN Value Calculation Agent, as applicable, and will, in \nthe absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on holders, us and JPMorgan Financial.\nThe Note Calculation Agent will provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee \nmay conclusively rely, of any amount payable on the Alerian ETNs at or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date \non which payment is to be made.\nAll values with respect to calculations in connection with the Alerian ETNs will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-\nthousandth, with five one-millionths rounded upward (e.g., 0.876545 would be rounded to 0.87655). Notwithstanding the \nforegoing, all dollar amounts related to determination of any payment on the Alerian ETNs per note will be rounded to the \nnearest ten-thousandth, with five one hundred-thousandths rounded upward (e.g., 0.76545 would be rounded up to \n0.7655), and all dollar amounts payable, if any, on the aggregate principal amount of Alerian ETNs per holder will be \nrounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward.\nTrustee:  Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas\nDay Count Fraction: With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, the day count fraction is calculated as follows:\nwhere:\na.\n“Y1” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that \nCoupon Valuation Date falls;\nb.\n“Y2” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day included in the \nCoupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;\nc.\n“M1” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Coupon Accrual Period with \nrespect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;\nd.\n“M2” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day included \nin the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;\ne.\n“D1” is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon \nValuation Date, unless that number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and\nf.\n“D2” is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last day included in the Coupon \nAccrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, unless that number would be 31 and D1 is greater than \n29, in which case D2 will be 30.\nSplit or Reverse Split of the Alerian ETNs\nThe Issuer may initiate a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs at any time. The Issuer will determine the ratio of such \nsplit or reverse split, as applicable, using relevant market indicia in its sole discretion. If the Issuer decides to initiate a split \nor reverse split, as applicable, the Issuer will issue a notice to holders of the Alerian ETNs and a press release announcing \nthe split or reverse split and the ratio and specifying the effective date of the split or reverse split, which will be at least \nthree Business Days after the date on which the split or reverse split, as applicable, is announced, which we refer to as the \n“announcement date.” The record date for a share split or reverse split will be the Business Day immediately preceding the \neffective date. \nIf the Alerian ETNs undergo a split or reverse split, the Issuer will adjust the terms of the Alerian ETNs as may be necessary \nor desirable to effectuate that split or reverse split, as applicable, including, without limitation, the Principal Amount, any \nCoupon Amount, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference \nDistribution Amount, the number of shares held by a Reference Holder and the minimum number of Alerian ETNs holders \nmay request that the Issuer repurchase. For example, if the Alerian ETNs undergo a 4-for-1 split, each Alerian ETN holder \nwho holds one Alerian ETN via DTC prior to the split will, after the split, hold four Alerian ETNs, and the Principal Amount, \nany Coupon Amount, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference \nDistribution Amount and the number of shares held by a Reference Holder will be adjusted as may be necessary or \ndesirable to equal 1/4 of their respective values that would have prevailed in the absence of the 4-for-1 split. In addition, \nthe minimum number of Alerian ETNs holders may request that the Issuer repurchase will be increased to equal 4 times \nits prior value. These adjustments may be applied retroactively for purposes of adjusting any Coupon Amount that has \nbeen determined but not yet paid.\nIn the case of a reverse split, holders who hold a number of Alerian ETNs that is not evenly divisible by the relevant ratio \nwill receive the same treatment as all other holders for the maximum number of Alerian ETNs they hold that is evenly \ndivisible by the relevant ratio, and the Issuer will have the right to compensate holders for their remaining or “partial” \nAlerian ETNs in a manner determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. The Issuer’s current intention is \nto provide holders with a cash payment for their partial Alerian ETNs in an amount equal to the appropriate percentage of \nthe Closing Intrinsic Note Value (which may be calculated using an Index Ratio that reflects the average VWAP Level over \na measurement period of five Index Business Days) on a specified Index Business Day no later than 20 Index Business \nDays following the announcement date, with payment to be made on a specified Business Day no later than five Business \nDays following the date on which the amount of the payment is determined.\nPostponement of a Payment Date\nIn this section, we refer to each Coupon Payment Date and the Maturity Date as “Payment Dates.” If any scheduled \nPayment Date is not a Business Day, then that Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day following the \nscheduled Payment Date. If, due to a market disruption event or otherwise, any Averaging Date referenced in the \ndetermination of a payment on the Alerian ETNs that will or may be payable on any Payment Date is postponed so that it \nfalls less than three Business Days prior to that scheduled Payment Date, that Payment Date will be the third Business Day \nfollowing the latest such Averaging Date, as postponed. If any Payment Date is adjusted as the result of a non-Business \nDay, a market disruption event or otherwise, any amount payable on that Payment Date will be made on that Payment \nDate as postponed, with the same force and effect as if that Payment Date had not been postponed, but no interest will \naccrue or be payable as a result of the delayed payment.\nPostponement of an Averaging Date\nThe Final VWAP Level used to determine the Closing Intrinsic Note Value in connection with any payment at maturity or \nupon early repurchase or redemption will reflect the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels on the five Index Business \nDays in the relevant Measurement Period, and the VWAP Level on each Index Business Day is calculated by reference to \nthe VWAP and the Index Units of each Index Component, as well as the Index Divisor. In this section, we refer to each of the \nfive Index Business Days in a Measurement Period as an “Averaging Date.” As set forth below, if any Index Component is \ndisrupted on any Averaging Date, determinations with respect to that Index Component for purposes of calculating the \nVWAP Level applicable to that Averaging Date will be postponed. In addition, determinations with respect to that \ndisrupted Index Component for purposes of calculating the VWAP Level applicable to each following Averaging Date will \nalso be postponed so as to avoid using the same VWAP of an Index Component on a given Index Business Day to calculate \nthe VWAP Levels for more than one Averaging Date.\nIf any Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day for any Index Component, the VWAP Level on that Averaging Date will be \ndeemed to be the Adjusted VWAP Level with respect to that Averaging Date, and that Averaging Date will be postponed \nto the earliest date on which that Adjusted VWAP Level can be calculated as set forth below. For the avoidance of doubt, \nno Averaging Date will be postponed to a date that is after the applicable Final Disrupted Averaging Date.\nThe “Adjusted VWAP Level” with respect to an Averaging Date that is an Unavailable Day for any Index Component will be \ndetermined by the VWAP Calculation Agent and will be calculated in accordance with the formula for calculating the \nVWAP Level, using: \na.\nwith respect to each Index Component for which the originally scheduled Averaging Date is not an Unavailable \nDay, the VWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index Divisor, in each case as of the \noriginally scheduled Averaging Date; and\nb.\nwith respect to each Index Component for which the originally scheduled Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day, \nthe VWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index Divisor, in each case, as of the first Index \nBusiness Day immediately following the originally scheduled Averaging Date that is not an Unavailable Day with \nrespect to that Index Component, provided that, if each day from and including the originally scheduled \nAveraging Date to and including the applicable Final Disrupted Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day with respect \nto that Index Component, the VWAP of that Index Component will be determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent \nin good faith based on its assessment of the market value of that Index Component on that Final Disrupted \nAveraging Date and the Index Units of that Index Component and the Index Divisor will each be determined by the \nVWAP Calculation Agent based on its good faith estimate.\nAn Index Business Day will be an “Unavailable Day” with respect to an Index Component if it is a Disrupted Day for that \nIndex Component or a day that is a Prior Valuation Date with respect to that Index Component and the relevant Averaging \nDate.\nA “Disrupted Day” means, with respect to an Index Component, a day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related \nExchange with respect to that Index Component fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a \nMarket Disruption Event with respect to that Index Component has occurred or is continuing, and, in each case, the \noccurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material effect on the VWAP Level.\nAn Index Business Day will be a “Prior Valuation Date” with respect to an Index Component and an Averaging Date if the \nVWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index Divisor, in each case as of that Index Business Day, \nwere used in calculating the Adjusted VWAP Level with respect to an earlier occurring originally scheduled Averaging \nDate within the same Measurement Period as that Averaging Date.\nWith respect to an Averaging Date, the “Final Disrupted Averaging Date” means the third Index Business Day after that \nAveraging Date, as originally scheduled.\nMarket Disruption Events\nWith respect to an Index Component, a “Market Disruption Event” means, the occurrence or existence of a condition \nspecified below:\na.\nany suspension, absence or limitation of trading in that Index Component on the Primary Exchange with respect \nto that Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the Primary \nExchange or otherwise;\nb.\nany suspension, absence or limitation of trading in futures or options contracts related to that Index Component, if \navailable, on any Related Exchange with respect to that Index Component, whether by reason of movements in \nprice exceeding limits permitted by that Related Exchange or otherwise;\nc.\nany event that disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain \nmarket values for, that Index Component or futures or options contracts relating to that Index Component; or\nd.\nthe closure on any Index Business Day of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange with respect to that \nIndex Component prior to its Scheduled Closing Time unless the earlier closing time is announced by the Primary \nExchange or that Related Exchange, as applicable, at least one hour prior to the earlier of (a) the actual closing \ntime for the regular trading session on the Primary Exchange or that Related Exchange, as applicable, on that \nIndex Business Day and (b) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the system for execution at the \nclose of trading on that Index Business Day for the Primary Exchange or that Related Exchange, as applicable;\nin each case determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion; and\na.\na determination by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion that the applicable event described above \nmaterially interfered with the Issuer’s ability or the ability of any of its affiliates to adjust or unwind all or a material \nportion of any hedge with respect to the Alerian ETNs.\nFor purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event with respect to an Index Component has occurred:\na.\na limitation on the hours or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from \nan announced change in the regular business hours of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange; and\nb.\nlimitations pursuant to the rules of the Primary Exchange or any Relevant Exchange similar to NYSE Rule 80B (or \nany applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any other self-regulatory organization or any \ngovernment agency of scope similar to NYSE Rule 80B as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) on trading \nduring significant market fluctuations will constitute a suspension, absence or material limitation of trading.\n“Scheduled Closing Time” means, with respect to the Primary Exchange or the Related Exchange, on any Index Business \nDay, the scheduled weekday closing time of the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day, \nwithout regard to after hours or any other trading outside of the regular trading session hours.\nDiscontinuation of the Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation\nIf the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of, or otherwise fails to publish, the Index, or if the Index Sponsor does not \nmake the Index Components, their Index Units or the Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent, and the Index \nSponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Note Calculation Agent determines, in its sole \ndiscretion, to be comparable to the discontinued Index and for which the index components, their Index Units and the \nindex divisor, or equivalent information, is available to the VWAP Calculation Agent (such index being referred to in this \nsection as a “successor index”), then the VWAP Level on any subsequent relevant date will be determined by reference to \nthe VWAPs of the index components of that successor index, their Index Units and the index divisor of that successor \nindex, or equivalent information, published with respect to that day and a fixed adjustment factor determined by the Note \nCalculation Agent upon the selection of that successor index to account for the difference in the levels of the Index and \nthat successor index at that time for purposes of maintaining comparability between prior VWAP Levels and succeeding \nVWAP Levels.\nUpon any selection by the Note Calculation Agent of a successor index, the Note Calculation Agent will cause written \nnotice thereof to be promptly furnished to the Trustee, us, the Issuer and DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs.\nPayment upon an Event of Default\nIn case an event of default with respect to the Alerian ETNs shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared \ndue and payable per Alerian ETN upon any acceleration of the Alerian ETNs will be determined by the Note Calculation \nAgent and will be an amount in cash equal to the amount payable at maturity per Alerian ETN calculated as if the date of \nacceleration were (a) the final day of the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date and (b) the Final \nDisrupted Averaging Date for the final day of the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date (if the date \nof acceleration is a Disrupted Day). Under these circumstances, the Measurement Period with respect to the Final \nValuation Date will consist of the date of acceleration and the four immediately preceding Index Business Days.\nThe amount determined as described above will constitute the final payment on the Alerian ETNs, and no additional \namounts will accrue with respect to the Alerian ETNs following the date of acceleration.\nIf the maturity of the Alerian ETNs is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will \ncause the Note Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the \nTrustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs, of the cash amount due with respect to the \nAlerian ETNs as promptly as possible and in no event later than two Business Days after the date of acceleration.\nListing\nThe Alerian ETNs have been listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “AMJB.”  No assurance can be given as to \nthe continued listing for the term of the Alerian ETNs, or the liquidity or trading market for the Alerian ETNs.  The Issuer is \nnot required to maintain a listing on NYSE Arca or any other exchange.\nBook-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company\nDTC will act as securities depositary for the Alerian ETNs. The Issuer will issue Alerian ETNs only in fully registered form as \nbook-entry notes. The Alerian ETNs will be represented by one or more permanent global notes deposited with, or on \nbehalf of, DTC and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. These certificates name DTC or its nominee as the owner \nof the Alerian ETNs. DTC maintains a computerized system that will reflect the interests held by its participants in the \nglobal notes. An investor’s beneficial interest will be reflected in the records of DTC’s direct or indirect participants \nthrough an account maintained by the investor with its broker/dealer, bank, trust company or other representative. \nThe Alerian ETNs will initially be represented by a type of global note referred to as a master note. A master note \nrepresents multiple securities that may be issued at different times and that may have different terms. Unless otherwise \nspecified, in connection with each issuance of the Alerian ETNs, the Trustee and/or paying agent will, in accordance with \ninstructions from the Issuer, make appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master note representing \nthe Alerian ETNs to indicate that the master note evidences the Alerian ETNs of that issuance.\nReferences to “holders” mean those who own Alerian ETNs registered in their own names, on the books that the Issuer or \nthe paying agent maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in Alerian ETNs registered in street \nname or in Alerian ETNs issued in book-entry form through DTC.\nDenominations\nBook-entry interests in Alerian ETNs will be issued in minimum denominations equal to the Principal Amount and in \nintegral multiples thereof.\nRegistrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent\nPayment of amounts due at maturity on the Alerian ETNs will be payable and the transfer of the Alerian ETNs will be \nregistrable at the principal corporate trust office of The Bank of New York Mellon in the City of New York.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Alerian ETNs. The Bank \nof New York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Alerian ETNs and may designate additional paying agents.\nRegistration of transfers of the Alerian ETNs will be effected without charge by or on behalf of The Bank of New York \nMellon but upon payment (with the giving of such indemnity as The Bank of New York Mellon may require) in respect of \nany tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to it.\nReopening Issuances\nIn Issuer’s sole discretion, and without providing holders notice or obtaining their consent, the Issuer may decide to issue \nand sell additional Alerian ETNs from time to time. These further issuances, if any, will be consolidated to form a single \nclass with the originally issued Alerian ETNs, will have the same CUSIP number and will trade interchangeably with the \noriginally issued Alerian ETNs immediately upon settlement.\nHowever, the Issuer is under no obligation to issue or sell additional Alerian ETNs at any time, and, if the Issuer does sell \nadditional Alerian ETNs, the Issuer may limit or restrict those sales, and the Issuer may stop and subsequently resume \nselling additional Alerian ETNs at any time. If the Issuer limits, restricts or stops sales of such additional Alerian ETNs, or if \nthe Issuer subsequently resumes sales of such additional Alerian ETNs, the liquidity and trading price of the Alerian ETNs \nin the secondary market could be materially and adversely affected. Unless the Issuer indicates otherwise, if the Issuer \nsuspends selling additional Alerian ETNs, the Issuer reserves the right to resume selling additional Alerian ETNs at any \ntime, which might result in the reduction or elimination of any premium in the trading price. If holders pay a premium for \nthe Alerian ETNs above the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value, holders could incur \nsignificant losses if holders sell their Alerian ETNs at a time when the premium is no longer present in the market.\nA suspension of additional issuances of the Alerian ETNs could result in a significant reduction in the number of \noutstanding Alerian ETNs if noteholders subsequently exercise their right to have the Alerian ETNs repurchased by the \nIssuer. Accordingly, the number of outstanding Alerian ETNs, and their liquidity, could vary substantially over the term of \nthe Alerian ETNs.\nThe Alerian ETNs do not limit the Issuer’s ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other securities. Also, the Issuer is \nnot subject to financial or similar restrictions by the terms of the Alerian ETNs. \nThe Issuer has no obligation to take holders’ interests into account when deciding whether to issue additional Alerian \nETNs. In addition, the Issuer is under no obligation to reopen any series of notes or to issue any additional Alerian ETNs.\nGeneral Terms of the Series A Notes\nFor a summary of the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the Series A Notes and guarantees issued thereunder, \nincluding provisions on events of defaults, modification of the 2016 Indenture and governing law, please see “— \nDescription of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC’s Callable Fixed Rate Notes Due June 10, 2032, Fully and \nUnconditionally Guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. — General Terms of the Series A Notes” below. \nDESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC’S CALLABLE FIXED RATE \nNOTES DUE JUNE 10, 2032, FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY JPMORGAN \nCHASE & CO.\nThe following description of the Callable Fixed Rate Notes due June 10, 2032 (the “Callable Notes”) is a summary and does \nnot purport to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February 19, \n2016 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial \nCompany LLC, as issuer (“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorganChase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and \nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to \nthe Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2016 Indenture for additional information.\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2024, $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes were outstanding.\nThe Callable Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully \nand unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Callable Notes will rank pari passu with all of the Issuer’s \nother unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Callable Notes will rank pari \npassu with all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  Any payment on the Callable \nNotes issued by JPMorgan Financial is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit \nrisk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the Callable Notes.\nThe Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the \n“Series A Notes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the \nSeries A Notes, please see the section titled “— General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.\nThe Callable Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any \nother governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\nUnless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Callable Notes are registered \non the books that the Issuer or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not \nthose who own beneficial interests in the Callable Notes (registered in street name or otherwise).\nKey Terms of the Callable Notes\nWe issued the Callable Notes on June 10, 2021, in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 \nthereafter.  The Maturity Date of the Callable Notes is June 10, 2032.  Interest on the Callable Notes is payable \nsemiannually on June 10th and December 10th of each year, beginning on December 10, 2021 to and including the Maturity \nDate (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), subject to any earlier redemption, at the Interest Rate of 2.60% per annum. \nOn June 10, 2031 (the “Redemption Date”), the Issuer may redeem the holders’ Callable Notes, in whole but not in part, at a \nprice equal to the principal amount being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  Any accrued and unpaid \ninterest on the Callable Notes redeemed will be paid to the person who is the holder of record on such Callable Notes at \nthe close of business one (1) business day prior to the Redemption Date.  To redeem the Callable Notes, the Issuer will \ndeliver notice to DTC, as holder of the Callable Notes, at least 5 business days and not more than 15 business days prior to \nthe Redemption Date.\nCalculation Agent \nJPMS (the “Calculation Agent”) will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Callable \nNotes, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Callable Notes.\nPayment upon an Event of Default\nIn case an event of default with respect to the Callable Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared \ndue and payable per $1,000 principal amount note upon any acceleration of the Callable Notes will be determined by the \nCalculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount note plus accrued and \nunpaid interest, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date.  In such case, interest will be calculated on \nthe basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days in such adjusted Interest Period and will be based on the \nInterest Rate on the applicable date immediately preceding such adjusted Interest Period.\nIf the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will \ncause the Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee \nmay conclusively rely, and to DTC of the cash amount due with respect to the Callable Notes as promptly as possible and \nin no event later than two business days after the date of acceleration.\nListing\nThe Callable Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol “JPM/32.” No assurance can \nbe given as to the continued listing for the term of the Callable Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the Callable \nNotes. \nBook-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company\nDTC will act as securities depositary for the Callable Notes.  The Callable Notes have been issued only as fully registered \nsecurities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, \nrepresenting the total aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes, have been issued and have been deposited with \nDTC.  We will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.\nRegistrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent\nThe Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Callable Notes.  The Bank \nof New York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Callable Notes and may designate additional paying agents.\nReopening Issuances\nThe Issuer may, in its sole discretion, “reopen” the Callable Notes based upon market conditions at that time.  These \nfurther issuances, if any, will be consolidated with, have the same CUSIP number as and trade interchangeably with the \nrespective originally issued Callable Notes immediately upon settlement and, consequently, will increase the aggregate \nprincipal amount of such outstanding Callable Notes.  The price of any additional offering will be determined at the time of \npricing of that offering.\nGeneral Terms of the Series A Notes\nIn this “General Terms of the Series A Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series A Notes issued \nby JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC.\nThe following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt \nsecurities, including the Callable Notes and the Alerian ETNs.\nWe have summarized below the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued \nunder the 2016 Indenture.\nThese descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2016 Indenture, which describes completely \nthe terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued \nunder it.  Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture.  Any \nreference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the \nentire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.\nThe debt securities will be the Issuer’s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer’s other \nunsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nThe Guarantor is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank, National Association (the \n“Bank”), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), its “intermediate holding company.” The Guarantor \nconducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including the Bank and the IHC. As a result, claims of the \nholders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of \ncreditors of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries. Claims of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ creditors other than the Guarantor \ninclude substantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other liabilities. In addition, the Guarantor is \nobligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds that the Guarantor receives from the issuance of \nsecurities (including the Alerian ETNs), and the ability of the Bank and the IHC to make payments to the Guarantor is \nlimited. As a result of these arrangements, the Guarantor’s ability to make various payments is dependent on its receiving \ndividends from the Bank and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the \nGuarantor’s ability to pay interest on its debt securities, redeem or repurchase outstanding securities and fulfill its other \npayment obligations, including payment obligations under the guarantees of our debt securities.\nEvents of Default and Waivers\nAn “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 \nIndenture as:\na.\ndefault in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;\nb.\ndefault in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at \nmaturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;\nc.\ndefault in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in \nthe 2016 Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written \nnotice has been given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in \naggregate principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor \nand the Trustee;\nd.\ncertain events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or \ninvoluntary;\ne.\nthe guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the \nGuarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, provided that no Event of Default with respect \nto the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the \nGuarantor or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a \nreceiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of \n2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, \nor the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, \nreceivership, winding up or liquidation; or\nf.\nany other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of \nsecurity. (Section 5.01)\nIf an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts \npayable on the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the \nIssuer, the guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable \nsupplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in \naggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice \nto the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest \naccrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a default due to specified events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, \ninsolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities \nand any interest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee \nor any holder, become immediately due and payable.  Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and \npast defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities \nof the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)\nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not \nconstitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.  In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform \nany of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any \nseries of debt securities.  Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation \nrelating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the \ndebt securities to be declared due and payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against the \nIssuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.  Instead, even \nif an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has \noccurred, the Trustee and the holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities \nto be immediately due and payable unless there is an Event of Default with respect to that series as described above, such \nas the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation or a payment default by the Issuer or the \nGuarantor on the relevant debt securities.  The value holders receive on any series of debt securities may be \nsignificantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the Issuer’s debt securities been declared due \nand payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor \nupon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.\nAn Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with \nrespect to any other series of debt securities.  The 2016 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with \nrespect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold \nnotice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust \ncommittee of directors or Trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the \ninterest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a \ndefault in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)\nThe 2016 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of \neach series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any \nproceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The \nTrustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2016 \nIndenture. (Section 5.09) The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2016 Indenture at \nthe request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity \nsatisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))\nNo holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has \npreviously given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders \nof not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request \nupon the Trustee to institute such action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the \nholders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) \nhave not given direction to the Trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)\nHowever, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that \ndebt security or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be \nimpaired or affected without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)\nThe 2016 Indenture requires the Issuer and the Guarantor to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to \nwhether or not the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05) \nThe Issuer, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank \nTrust Company Americas and The Bank of New York Mellon. If an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect \nto any debt securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act \nof 1939, as amended. In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2016 Indenture, and the Issuer would \nbe required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be \nan event of default if the requirements for giving the Issuer default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific \nperiod of time were disregarded.\nModification of the 2016 Indenture\nThe 2016 Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the 2016 Indenture \nor the rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate \nprincipal amount of each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected \ndebt security must consent to a modification that would:\na.\nextend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt \nsecurity;\nb.\nreduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;\nc.\nchange the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2016 Indenture \napplicable to debt securities in foreign currencies;\nd.\nchange the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any \ndebt security;\ne.\nreduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;\nf.\nimpair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any \nright of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security;\ng.\nreduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any \nmodification; or\nh.\nmake any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of the debt securities of such series or \nrelease the Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Indenture. (Section 8.02)\nThe 2016 Indenture also permits the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to amend the 2016 Indenture in certain \ncircumstances without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s merger or \nthe replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, \nto make any change to the 2016 Indenture or the Issuer’s debt securities that the Issuer deems necessary or desirable and \nthat does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. \n(Section 8.01)\nConsolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets\nNeither the Issuer nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or \nsubstantially all of their respective assets to any other entity, unless:\na.\nwith respect to the Issuer:\ni.\neither the Issuer is the continuing company in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor \nentity in the case of a merger or consolidation (including an affiliate of the Guarantor) or the entity to \nwhom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a \nUnited States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual \npayment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the \ndue and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture \nbinding upon the Issuer, and\nii.\nno Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of \nDefault has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, \nconveyance or transfer, and\na.\nwith respect to the Guarantor:\ni.\neither the Guarantor is the continuing corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the \nsuccessor corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the entity to whom those assets are \nsold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation \nthat expressly assumes the full and unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the \nprincipal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual \nperformance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the \nGuarantor, and\nii.\nno Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of \nDefault has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, \nconveyance or transfer. (Sections 9.01 and 9.02)\nAny transfer of material assets of the Guarantor to any other entity that occurs as a result of, or because it is related \ndirectly or indirectly to, any proceedings relative to the Guarantor under Title 11 of the United States Code or under a \nreceivership under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or under any other \napplicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law will be deemed to be a sale, conveyance \nor transfer of all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets.\nThere are no covenants or other provisions in the 2016 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional \nprotection in the event of a recapitalization transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor, a change of control of the \nIssuer or the Guarantor or a highly leveraged transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor.  The merger covenant \ndescribed above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction \nwere structured to include a merger or consolidation of the Issuer or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all or \nsubstantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s assets.  However, the Issuer may provide specific protections, such as a \nput right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which the Issuer would describe in the applicable prospectus \nsupplement.\nJPMorganChase Guarantee\nThe Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all \nother amounts payable under the debt securities when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon \nredemption, repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable debt securities or upon acceleration.  If for any \nreason the Issuer does not make any required payment in respect of the Issuer’s debt securities when due, the Guarantor \nwill on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by the \nIssuer under the 2016 Indenture.  The guarantee is of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01)\nThe Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be \nliable for any amount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually \ndue and owing by the Issuer, and (2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely \nfrom, or on account of, the Issuer’s insolvency or the Issuer’s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency \nproceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to \nthe Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer. (Section 14.02)\nConcerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent\nWe, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust \nCompany Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.  The Bank of New \nYork Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of \nNew York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt \nsecurities issued under the 2016 Indenture.\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 \nIndenture, to which JPMorganChase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which \nJPMorganChase acts as a guarantor, and the debt securities issued under JPMorganChase’s indenture.  \nGoverning Law and Judgments\nThe debt securities and the 2016 Indenture, including the guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance \nwith, the laws of the State of New York. (Section 11.08)  \nExhibit 10.19\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF JANUARY 21, 2025\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\nOPERATING COMMITTEE\nAward Agreement\nThese terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of January 21, 2025 (“Grant Date”) awarding \nRestricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To \nthe extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with \nthe Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether \nwritten or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.\nThis award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in \nthe manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, \neffective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.\nCapitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same \nmeaning as set forth in the Plan. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase” and together with its \nsubsidiaries as the “Firm”.\nForm and Purpose of Award\nEach RSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date as \nset forth in your Award Agreement.\nThe purpose of this award is to motivate your future performance for services to be provided during the vesting period \nand to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.\nDividend Equivalents\nIf dividends are paid on Common Stock while RSUs under this award are outstanding, you will be paid an amount equal to \nthe dividend paid on one share of Common Stock, multiplied by the number of RSUs outstanding under this award as of \nthe dividend record date.\nVesting Period\nThe period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” \npursuant to which the Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to \nwhich the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).\nProtection-Based Vesting\nThis award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the \nFirm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--\nJob Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of \nRSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, the section captioned \n“Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision).\nUp to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk \nRSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion \nthat cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following \nfactors:\n•\nYour performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the \npriorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory \nfor a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net \nincome, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute \nbasis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. \n•\nFor any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at \nthe Firm level is negative.\n•\nAwards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period \nexercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not \nmeet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  \n•\nThe Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.\nIn the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or \n“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the \nGovernment Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk \nRSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From \nEmployment by a Government Entity”.\nAny determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the \nCompensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In \nthe case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.\nBonus Recoupment     \nIn consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment \nPolicy (or successor policy) as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded \nto you for performance year 2024 and to this award.

Corporate Governance Principles web page and scrolling to the Bonus \nRecoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters”:\nhttps://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles\nFor the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms and conditions in any way limits the rights of the Firm under the \nJPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).\nTermination of Employment\nExcept as explicitly set forth below under the subsections captioned “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--\nGovernment Office” or “--Disability” or under the section captioned “Death”, any RSUs outstanding under this award will \nbe cancelled effective on the date your employment with the Firm terminates for any reason.\nSubject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, \n“Bonus Recoupment”,  “Your Obligations” and “Remedies”), you will be eligible to continue to vest (as you otherwise would \nvest if you were still employed by JPMorgan Chase) with respect to your award in accordance with its terms and conditions \nfollowing the termination of your employment if one of the following circumstances applies to you:\n•\nJob Elimination \nIn the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that\n•\nthe Firm terminated your employment because your job was eliminated, and \n•\nafter you are notified that your job will be eliminated, you provided such services as requested by the Firm in a \ncooperative and professional manner, and\n•\nyou satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.\n•\nFull Career Eligibility \nIn the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that\n•\n(i) you voluntarily terminated your employment with the Firm, and (ii) had completed at least five years of \nRecognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination with at least three years of continuous \nservice with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date or if you are over 60 years of age with at \nleast three years of continuous service with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date, and \n•\nthe sum of your age and Recognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination equaled or \nexceeded 60 and\n•\nyou provided at least 180 days advance written notice to the Firm of your intention to voluntarily terminate \nyour employment under this provision, during which notice period you provided such services as requested \nby the Firm in a cooperative and professional manner and you did not perform any services for any other \nemployer, and \n•\ncontinued vesting shall be appropriate, which determination shall be made prior to your termination and will \nbe based on your performance and conduct (before and after providing notice), and  \n•\nyou satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below, and\n•\nfor 36 months from the date of grant of this award you do not either perform services in any capacity (such as \nan employee, contractor, consultant, advisor, or self-employed individual, whether paid or unpaid) for a \nFinancial Services Company (as defined below) or work in your profession (whether or not for a Financial \nServices Company); provided that you may do one or more of the following:\n◦\nwork in a government, education or Not-for-Profit Organization (as defined below),\n◦\nsubject to disclosure and confirmation of the following, serve on the board of directors of a public or \nnon-public company that is not a Financial Services Company.\nAfter receipt of such advance written notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during \nsuch 180-day period as a condition to continued vesting or shorten the length of the 180-day period at the Firm’s sole \ndiscretion, but to a date no earlier than the date you would otherwise meet the age and service requirements.  \nAdditional advance notice requirements may apply for employees subject to notice period policies (see “Notice \nPeriod” below).\n•\nGovernment Office\nIn the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm to accept a Government Office or become a \ncandidate for an elective Government Office, as described at the end of these terms and conditions under the section \ncaptioned “Government Office Requirements”.

This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service \nafter your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. \nThese restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, \nsuch as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the \nFirm’s policies.\nYou will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone \nany Confidential Information (as defined herein) related to the Firm’s business or its customers except as explicitly \npermitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. “Confidential \nInformation” includes but is not limited to: (i) information received by the Firm from third parties under confidential \nconditions; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets, technical, product, business, financial, or development \ninformation from the Firm, the use or disclosure of which reasonably might be construed to be contrary to the interest \nof the Firm; or (iii) other proprietary information or data, including, but not limited to, customer lists.  In addition, \nfollowing your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private \nand internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  \nFor Employees with a Work Location in California, you agree that the restrictions in the first paragraph of this \n“Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation” provision shall not apply to you. However, you agree that, as a condition of \nreceipt of this award, you will not, for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment \nor, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, use \n“Confidential Information” in order to solicit or otherwise interfere in the relationship between the Firm and any current \nFirm customers, suppliers, or other persons or entities whose names become known to you by virtue of your \nemployment with the Firm and in connection with your access to Confidential Information.\nNothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a \nregulator, a self-regulatory agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or \nconcerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation.

JPMorgan Chase is not responsible \nfor any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated \nconsistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other \nLimitations”.\n•\nRecovery\nIn addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the \napplicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as \nfollows:\n•\nPayment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-\nof-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:\n◦\nyou committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your \nemployment, or\n◦\nyou violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”, or\n◦\nyou violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility” or “--\nGovernment Office” following the termination of your employment.\n•\nIn addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to \nnotice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the \ndetrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other \nCancellation/Recapture” subsection.  \nNotice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring \npayment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  \nWithout limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to \nprovide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection \nshall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be \nunder no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.\nFor purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  \nHowever, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to \nshares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to \npay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made \n(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund \nor other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in \nhis or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.\nPayment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery \nunder the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  \nNothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment”.\n•\nRight to an Injunction \nYou acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein \nwill cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a \nmatter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation \nof any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in \naddition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.\nAdministrative Provisions \nWithholding Taxes: As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each \ndistribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any \nother desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent \nauthorities with respect to the vested shares, dividend equivalents and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) \na market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the \nextent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to \nthe award, shares that vest under this award, and/or dividend equivalents, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this \naward or dividend equivalents until you pay any taxes associated with the award, vested shares and/or the dividend \nequivalents directly to the competent authorities.  \nRight to Set Off: Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting \ndate, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including \nSection 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from \nany vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account \nagreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or \nunrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any \nobligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to \naccounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.\nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry \nvoting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in \naccordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its \nsole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our \nstock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You \nalso acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the \nperiod when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled \nin whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Termination of Employment” \nand “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)\nWith respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such \nperiod as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem \nappropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of \nsuch shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or \nreceive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such \nspecified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you \nmay be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting \ndate) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to \nSet Off” subsection above).  (See Sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment” and “Remedies”.)\nBinding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger \nor otherwise.\nNot a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or \ncontinued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason \nat any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm \nto provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining \nseverance.\nSection 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of \nshares and cash hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including \nthese terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified \nemployee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from \nservice (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred \ncompensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six \nmonths following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first \ncalendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.

Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net \nincome, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute \nbasis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. \n•\nFor any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at \nthe Firm level is negative.\n•\nAwards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period \nexercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not \nmeet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  \n•\nThe Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.\nIn the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or \n“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the \nGovernment Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk \nRSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From \nEmployment by a Government Entity”.\nAny determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the \nCompensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In \nthe case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.\nHolding Requirement\nAs of each vesting date, you shall be entitled to a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of RSUs vesting \non such date, less the number being withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  You agree that the distribution made \nto you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, \nselling, pledging, or otherwise encumbering such distribution for a twelve-month period commencing with the vesting \ndate.  Such restrictions shall lapse in event of your death.\nBonus Recoupment     \nIn consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment \nPolicy (or successor policy) as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded \nto you for performance year 2024 and to this award.

Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in \nhis or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.\nPayment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery \nunder the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  \nNothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” and “EMEA Malus and Clawback \nPolicy - Identified Staff”.\n•\nRight to an Injunction \nYou acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein \nwill cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a \nmatter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation \nof any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”;  such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in \naddition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.\nAdministrative Provisions \nWithholding Taxes: As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each \ndistribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any \nother desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent \nauthorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.

This restriction on the Firm does not apply to \naccounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.\nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry \nvoting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in \naccordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its \nsole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our \nstock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.

(See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback \nPolicy - Identified Staff”, “Termination of Employment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--\nAmendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)\nWith respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such \nperiod as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem \nappropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of \nsuch shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or \nreceive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such \nspecified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you \nmay be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting \ndate) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to \nSet Off” subsection above).  (See Sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment” and “Remedies”.)\nBinding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger \nor otherwise.\nNot a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or \ncontinued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason \nat any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm \nto provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining \nseverance.\nSection 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of \nshares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these \nterms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified \nemployee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from \nservice (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred \ncompensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six \nmonths following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first \ncalendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.

This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service \nafter your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. \nThese restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, \nsuch as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the \nFirm’s policies.\nYou will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone \nany Confidential Information (as defined herein) related to the Firm’s business or its customers except as explicitly \npermitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. “Confidential \nInformation” includes but is not limited to: (i) information received by the Firm from third parties under confidential \nconditions; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets, technical, product, business, financial, or development \ninformation from the Firm, the use or disclosure of which reasonably might be construed to be contrary to the interest \nof the Firm; or (iii) other proprietary information or data, including, but not limited to, customer lists.  In addition, \nfollowing your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private \nand internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means.\nFor Employees with a Work location in California, you agree that the restrictions in the first paragraph of the \n“Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation” provision shall not apply to you.  However, you agree that, as a condition of \nreceipt of this award, you will not, for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment \nor, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, use \n“Confidential Information” in order to solicit or otherwise interfere in the relationship between the Firm and any current \nFirm customers, suppliers, or other persons or entities whose names become known to you by virtue of your \nemployment with the Firm and in connection with your access to Confidential Information.\nNothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a \nregulator, a self-regulatory agency, your attorneys, or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or \nconcerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding \ntruthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.\nIf you are required by law or requested to provide information to any private party, including the news media, related \nto your or anyone else’s employment with the Firm, you will, in advance of providing any response (to the extent \nlawfully permitted), and within five days of receiving any such legal demand or request, provide written notice to the \nFirm.

This Agreement does not restrict you from communicating with any federal, state, or local government, \nregulatory, or law enforcement agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be \nconducted by any such agency, including providing documents or other information without notice to the Firm.\n•\nCompliance with Award Agreement \nYou will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award \nAgreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be \naffected thereby, including your prospective employer.\n•\nNotice Period \nIf you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or \nby policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice \nPeriod”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary \nadvance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.  \nAfter receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable \nNotice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, \nyou shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and \nprofessional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and \ncertain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the \nlength of the Notice Period. \nRegardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period \ndescribed under the subsection captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment \nunder that same subsection.\nRemedies\n•\nDetrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture \nIn addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus \nRecoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation” and “Termination of Employment”, \nup to 100% of your outstanding PSUs under this award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated \nReinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole \ndiscretion determines that:\n•\nAny of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:\n◦you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm \nto the Firm or its business activities, or\n◦this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible \nfor the inaccuracy, or\n◦this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or\n◦you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as \nreasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business \nactivities, or\n◦your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “Definitions” below) or, in the case of a \ndetermination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated \nfor Cause.\n•\nyou have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions \napplicable to your termination of employment, or\n•\nyou have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by the \nspecified deadline, or\n•\nyou have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.\nTo the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to \nsuspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any \nperiod that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or \nwhether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied.  The Firm is not responsible for any \nprice fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent \nwith Plan administration procedures.  See also “Administrative Provisions—No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.\nIn addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the \napplicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares previously distributed, including vested \nshares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:\n•\nPayment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three-year period \nprior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:\n◦\nyou committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; \n◦\nyou violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations;” or\n◦\nyou violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government \nOffice” following the termination of your employment.\n•\nIn addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to \nnotice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the \ndetrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other \nCancellation/Recapture” subsection.\nNotice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring \npayment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  \nWithout limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to \nprovide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection \nshall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be \nunder no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.\nFor purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  \nHowever, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to \nshares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to \npay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made \n(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund \nor other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in \nhis or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.\nPayment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery \nunder the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  \nNothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” or “Recovery of Erroneously \nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation”.\n•\nRight to an Injunction \nYou acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein \nwill cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a \nmatter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation \nof any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in \naddition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.  \nAdministrative Provisions \nWithholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each \ndistribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any \nother desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent \nauthorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a \nnumber of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by \nlaw, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and \nshares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated \nwith the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities.  \nRight to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting \ndate, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including \nSection 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from \nany vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account \nagreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or \nunrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any \nobligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not \napply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.\nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry \nvoting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if \nany, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By \naccepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your \nname with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that \naccount any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the \ncancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been \nsuspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based \nVesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation”, “Termination of \nEmployment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “—Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)\nWith respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such \nperiod as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem \nappropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of \nsuch shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or \nreceive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such \nspecified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you \nmay be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting \ndate) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to \nSet Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation” and “Remedies”.)   \nBinding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger \nor otherwise.\nNot a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or \ncontinued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason \nat any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm \nto provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining \nseverance.\nSection 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of \nshares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these \nterms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified \nemployee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from \nservice (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred \ncompensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six \nmonths following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first \ncalendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is \nnot subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the \nremainder of each calendar year immediately following the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a \npayment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award. \nChange in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any \nstock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, \ncombination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common \nStock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, \nin the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan \nand to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. \nOther Equitable Adjustments: The Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as it deems to be \nequitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual \nor non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case \nresulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or \nregulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate.\nInterpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and \nadminister this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this \nAward Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-\nemployment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; \nand (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, \nthe Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the \nCommittee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By \nway of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be \nentitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.\nAmendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any \ntime and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under \nthis Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable \nto (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and \naccounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described \nabove under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code \nif it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human \nResources of JPMorgan Chase.\nSeverability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any \ncourt or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., \nas to length of service, time, geographical area, or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary \nto make the provision enforceable under applicable law.  \nAccelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon \nreceipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or \nconflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may \naccelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, including Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, \neffective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated \ndistribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated \ndistribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period \nfor recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration \nevent.\nIf you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned \n“Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding \naward that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is \noutstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall \napply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of \nCommon Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section \ncaptioned “Death”. \nTo the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to \ndivestiture requirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.\nNotwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will \nremain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the \nduration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of the vesting date, including, but \nnot limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the \nsections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “Full Career \nEligibility”. \nUse of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the \npurposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on \nyour behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for \ncompensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your \npersonal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we \ncollected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any \ntime, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you \nterminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled. \nGoverning Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, \nwithout regard to conflicts of law principles. \nChoice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise \nsubject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly \nin connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American \nArbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.

In addition, you agree that you are not \nentitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the \nevent of such a suit by the Firm. \nNon-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance-\nbased share units, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, \nhypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a \nbeneficiary designation on file with the Firm.\nDefinitions\n“Average Tangible Common Equity” means annual average common stockholders’ equity less annual average goodwill \nand annual average identifiable intangible assets.

Long-Term Incentive Plan \n(“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) \nconflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other \nagreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.\nThis award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline \nand in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, \neffective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.\nCapitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same \nmeaning as set forth in the Plan. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its \nsubsidiaries as the “Firm”.\nForm and Purpose of Award\nEach PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock following each vesting date as set \nforth in your Award Agreement.\nThe purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those \nof the Firm and its shareholders.\nNumber of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period\nSubject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:\nPerformance calculation:  The number of PSUs at the end of the Performance Period will be derived by multiplying the \nTarget Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.  \nThe number of PSUs determined above will be subject to the Qualitative Performance Factor (as detailed below), which if \nthe Committee determines that such an adjustment is appropriate, will be applied following the end of each year during \nthe Performance Period, to adjust downward one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each calendar year in the \nPerformance Period.  Additionally, the Committee, in its discretion, may make a qualitative performance assessment \nbased on the entire three-year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of \nPSUs determined above.\nSee sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”.\nDelivery of vested shares of common stock to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last \nsentence of the subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.\nReinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units\nThis award is not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent share units.\nHolding Requirement \nThe net number of shares of Common Stock (after tax and all other lawful withholdings) in which you have vested, if any, as \nof the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing \nyou from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for (i) a twelve month \nperiod measured from each vesting date; and (ii) a two-year period for such shares vesting on ________________, with the \nholding periods running concurrently.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two-year holding \nperiod, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, \n“Death” and subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by \na Government Entity”.\nCalculation of Performance Ranking\nFor purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance \nPeriod shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common \nEquity” (if otherwise applicable), “Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” and “ROTCE” as set \nforth in the “Definitions” section of these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “Definitions”.  Except for Firm’s \nexternally published Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy%), \nrounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “Definitions--Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All \nperformance-based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.\nCapital Ratio Performance Threshold \nUnvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below \na predetermined threshold of ______%.\nIf the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to \none-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the Compensation & \nManagement Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”) for each such year.\nQualitative Performance \nDetermination of Qualitative Performance Factor.  Annually during the Performance Period, the Committee will formally \nassess your qualitative performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls & \nConduct; (3) Teamwork & Leadership; and (4) Business Results. If the Committee determines that your performance \n“Meets” expectations, no downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for that year shall take \nplace (and the Qualitative Performance Factor shall be 100%). If the Committee determines that your performance did \n“Not Meet” expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what \nextent.  A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0% and 99%, depending on \nthe circumstances.  During the Performance Period, a 0% Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period \nwould reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to zero, resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting. \nAdditionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on \nyour performance during the entire three-year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the \nentire number of PSUs determined under section captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at the end of the \nPerformance Period”.  In the case of a Qualitative Performance Factor of 0%, the award would be cancelled.\nThe assessment will have regard to feedback solicited from the Chair of the UK Remuneration Committee to incorporate \nqualitative performance against local regulatory responsibilities as a “Senior Manager” of the relevant UK-regulated \nentities.\nThe Qualitative Performance Factor shall only be applied, if applicable, in respect of a period of your employment with the \nFirm, or as soon as administratively practical.\nProtection-Based Vesting\nThis award is intended and expected to vest on each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, provided that you \nare continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting \ndescribed under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  \nHowever, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not \nlimited to, sections captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period”, “Capital Ratio \nPerformance Threshold”, “Remedies”, and the following protection-based vesting provision).  \nUp to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you as of any vesting date (“At Risk \nPSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion \nthat cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following \nfactors:\n•\nYour performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for \nwhich you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained \nperiod of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are:  net income, total net revenue, \nearnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. \n•\nFor any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the \nFirm level is negative.\n•\nRSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, \ndirect or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual \nLine of Business Financial Threshold.  \n•\nThe Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold. \nFor avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur \nprior to the end of the Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the \nend of the Performance Period will be up to fifty percent of the Target Award Number.  \nIn the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, “Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or \n“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the \nGovernment Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply.\nAny determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Committee.  \nIn the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified \nby the Board.\nBonus Recoupment\nIn consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment \nPolicy (or successor policy) as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded \nto you for performance year 20______ and to this award.

The Firm is not responsible for any \nprice fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent \nwith Plan administration procedures.  See also “Administrative Provisions—No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.\nIn addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the \napplicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, \nincluding vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:\n•\nPayment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three-year period \nprior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:\n◦\nyou committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; \n◦\nyou violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”; or\n◦\nyou violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government \nOffice” following the termination of your employment.\n•\nIn addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one-year period prior to \nnotice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the \ndetrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other \nCancellation/Recapture” subsection.\nNotice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring \npayment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  \nWithout limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to \nprovide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection \nshall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be \nunder no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.\nFor purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  \nHowever, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to \nshares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to \npay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made \n(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund \nor other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in \nhis or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.\nPayment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery \nunder the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  \nNothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously \nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation” or “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”.\n•\nRight to an Injunction \nYou acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein \nwill cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a \nmatter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation \nof any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in \naddition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.  \nAdministrative Provisions\nWithholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each \ndistribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any \nother desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent \nauthorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a \nnumber of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by \nlaw, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and \nshares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated \nwith the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities.  \nRight to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting \ndate, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including \nSection 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from \nany vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account \nagreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or \nunrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any \nobligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not \napply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.\nNo Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry \nvoting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if \nany, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By \naccepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your \nname with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that \naccount any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the \ncancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been \nsuspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based \nVesting”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based \nCompensation”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”, “Termination of Employment” and “Remedies”, as \nwell as the subsection captioned “—Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)\nWith respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such \nperiod as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem \nappropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of \nsuch shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or \nreceive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such \nspecified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you \nmay be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting \ndate) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to \nSet Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation” and “Remedies”.)   \nBinding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger \nor otherwise.\nNot a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or \ncontinued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason \nat any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm \nto provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining \nseverance.\nSection 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of \nshares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these \nterms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified \nemployee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from \nservice (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred \ncompensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six \nmonths following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first \ncalendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is \nnot subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the \nremainder of each calendar year immediately following each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a \npayment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award. \nChange in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any \nstock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, \ncombination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common \nStock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, \nin the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan \nand to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. \nOther Equitable Adjustments: Except for the “Qualitative Performance Factor”, the Committee may make adjustments \n(up or down) to the award as it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed \ncircumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or \nits financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in \ncapital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee \nmay deem appropriate.\nInterpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and \nadminister this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this \nAward Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-\nemployment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; \nand (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, \nthe Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the \nCommittee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By \nway of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be \nentitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.\nAmendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any \ntime and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under \nthis Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable \nto (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and \naccounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described \nabove under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code \nif it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human \nResources of JPMorgan Chase. \nSeverability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any \ncourt or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., \nas to length of service, time, geographical area, or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary \nto make the provision enforceable under applicable law.  \nAccelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon \nreceipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or \nconflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may \naccelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, effective on or before the required divestiture date and \nwaive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such \nacceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the \ndates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally \nscheduled vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.\nIf you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned \n“Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding \naward that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is \noutstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall \napply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of \nCommon Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section \ncaptioned “Death”. \nTo the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to \ndivestiture requirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.\nNotwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will \nremain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the \nduration of the vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each vesting date, including, but not \nlimited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the \nsections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “Full Career \nEligibility”. \nUse of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the \npurposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on \nyour behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for \ncompensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your \npersonal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we \ncollected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any \ntime, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you \nterminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled. \nGoverning Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, \nwithout regard to conflicts of law principles. \nChoice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise \nsubject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly \nin connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American \nArbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.

An Open Window Period may be closed or \nsuspended at any time if circumstances require such action with respect to \nsome or all persons designated as Window List Personnel. If preapproval for a \ntransaction is requested during a Closed Window Period, the Window List \nPerson making the request will receive a denial notification from Compliance \nand will not be authorized to execute the trade.

To enter into a \n10b5-1 Plan, a Corporate Officer or Director must comply with the preapproval \nrequirements described in Section 6.2 of this Policy.\nAll 10b5-1 Plans must comply with all of the requirements set forth in Rule \n10b5-1(c) and may be entered into, amended or terminated only during an \nOpen Window Period. \n6.2\nPre-approval for Firm Securities Transactions and Entry into 10b5-1 Plans\nDuring an Open Window Period, Corporate Officers  and Directors are \npermitted to trade in Firm Securities after obtaining the preapprovals \ndescribed below.  \n• Corporate Officers and Directors must receive preapproval from the CEO \nand the GC for any transactions in Firm Securities that require \npreapproval under Section 5 and for entry into, amendment of or \ntermination of a 10b5-1 Plan under Section 6.1. \n• In the case of transactions or 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the GC, \npreapproval is required from the CEO, \n• in the case of transactions or 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the Firmwide \nController, approval is required from the GC and the CFO, and \n• in the case of transactions or 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the CEO, \napproval is required from the GC. \nThe preapprovals described above for Corporate Officers are submitted to \nthe Compliance Department for its preapproval, which is valid for the length \nindicated on the approval notification which is generally the end of the next \nbusiness day, unless otherwise stipulated.   \n7. Other Prohibitions\nOther restrictions that are applicable to transactions in Firm Securities are described \nbelow.\n7.1\nProhibited Trading Activity\nTrading with respect to Firm Securities is prohibited for Window List \nPersonnel and all other Firm Personnel who are subject to personal account \ndealing restrictions under Firm policies in the following: \n• Forwards and futures (all asset classes) \n• Swaps (all asset classes) \n• Uncovered option strategies except Long-Term Equity Anticipation \nSecurities (LEAPS) \n• Short sales\nExcept as set forth in Section 7.2, direct hedging strategies (e.g., covered \ncalls) with respect to Firm Securities are permitted but must be proportionate \nto the risk (i.e., fully covered with underlying shares).   \nAll Employees are prohibited from hedging or pledging unvested shares of \nJPMC common stock received as compensation.\n7.2\nAnti-Hedging/Anti-Pledging\nShares of JPMC common stock owned outright or through deferred \ncompensation by a member of the JPMC Operating Committee or Director \nmay not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged as collateral, nor \nmay the economic risk of such shares be hedged. \n7.3\nMinimum Holding Period\nWindow List Personnel and their Connected Persons are required to hold Firm \nSecurities for a minimum holding period (specific to each region and/or line of \nbusiness) prior to transacting in those Firm Securities. \nVested shares of JPMC common stock or shares of JPMC common stock \nreceived in connection with purchases under the ESPP are deemed to have \nsatisfied the minimum holding period requirement.\n8. Post-termination Transactions\nIf a Firm Person is aware of Firm MNPI when their employment, directorship or other \nservice relationship with the Firm terminates, that Firm Person and their Connected \nPersons may not trade in Firm Securities or disclose any Firm Material Nonpublic \nInformation until such information has become public or is no longer material.\n9. Personal Responsibility for Compliance with this Policy and Potential Disciplinary \nAction\nThis Policy is designed to reduce the risk of violations of the insider trading \nprovisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, but compliance with this Policy is not an \nassurance that an insider trading violation will not be found to have occurred.  The \nultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and avoiding improper trading \nrests exclusively with Firm Personnel and their Connected Persons.  Any action on \nthe part of Firm Personnel and their Connected Persons pursuant to this Policy (or \notherwise) does not insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities \nlaws and this Policy does not constitute legal advice in any way.  The existence of a \npersonal financial emergency does not excuse anyone subject to this Policy from \ncompliance with this Policy and the laws prohibiting insider trading.\nIn addition to potential criminal and civil liability, failure to comply with the \nrequirements of this Policy may result in the receipt of Policy reminders or violations \nwhich may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment \n(subject to local laws and regulations).  The Firm also reserves the right to instruct an \nindividual to cancel any trade at his or her expense.\nFor further information or questions regarding this Policy, Firm Personnel may reach \nout to the Compliance Department or Office of the Secretary.  Firm Personnel should \nalso refer to the Code of Conduct and other related Firm policies.\nExhibit 21\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nList of subsidiaries\nWhile there are a number of subsidiaries that are required to be reported for various purposes to bank regulators, \nthe following is a list of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s significant legal entity subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024, as \ndefined by SEC rules.

Policy Statement\nThe Firm shall recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based \nCompensation in the event that the Firm is required to prepare a Restatement.\nFor clarity, the Firm’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based \nCompensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or when a Restatement is filed. \nThe Firm shall recover Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in compliance \nwith this Policy except to the extent provided under Section 4.1.2 below.\n4.1\nRecovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation\n4.1.1\nIn the event of a Restatement, the Firm will reasonably promptly recover the \nErroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation received in accordance \nwith the NYSE rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n•\nFor purposes of determining the relevant Recovery Period, the date that the Firm \nis required to prepare the Restatement (“Restatement Date”) is the earlier to \noccur of:\n◦\nthe date the Board of Directors of the Firm (the “Board”), a committee of \nthe Board, or the officer or officers of the Firm authorized to take such \naction if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should \nhave concluded, that the Firm is required to prepare a Restatement, or\n◦\nthe date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the \nFirm to prepare a Restatement.  \n•\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board (the \n“Committee”) composed of independent directors responsible for executive \ncompensation, or in the absence of such committee, a majority of the \nindependent directors serving on the Board, shall determine the Erroneously \nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation received by each Executive Officer \nduring the relevant Recovery Period. \n•\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery under this \nPolicy is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the \namount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been \nreceived had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed \nwithout regard to any taxes paid (the “Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based \nCompensation”). \n•\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Firm’s stock \nprice or total shareholder return, where the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from \nthe information in the applicable Restatement:\n◦\nThe amount to be recovered shall be based on a reasonable estimate of \nthe effect of the Restatement on the Firm’s stock price or total \nshareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was \nreceived; and\n◦\nThe Firm shall maintain documentation of the determination of such \nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the NYSE.\n•\nThe Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of \nrecovering Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation based on the \nparticular facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set \nforth in 4.1.2 below, in no event may the Firm settle for an amount that is less than \nthe Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to \nrecovery under this Policy.\n•\nTo the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Firm for any \nErroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation received under any \nduplicative recovery obligations established by the Firm or applicable law, it shall \nbe appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the Erroneously \nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this \nPolicy.\n1.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Firm shall not be required to \ntake the actions contemplated by Section 4.1.1 above if it is determined by the \nCommittee that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following \nconditions are met:\n•\nThe direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would \nexceed the amount to be recovered. Before making this determination, the Firm \nshall make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation, document such attempt(s) and provide such \ndocumentation to the NYSE;\n•\nRecovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to \nNovember 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be \nimpracticable to recover any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based \nCompensation based on violation of home country law, the Firm shall obtain an \nopinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would \nresult in such a violation and a copy of the opinion shall be provided to the NYSE; \nor \n•\nRecovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under \nwhich benefits are broadly available to employees of the Firm, to fail to meet the \nrequirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\n4.2\nDisclosure Requirements\nThe Firm shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy and recoveries under this Policy \nin accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Federal securities laws, including the \ndisclosure required by the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings.\n4.3\nProhibition of Indemnification\nNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification arrangement or insurance policy with any \nindividual covered by this Policy, the Firm shall not indemnify any Executive Officer or former \nExecutive Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, \nincluding any payment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance obtained by any such \ncovered individual to fund amounts recoverable under this Policy.\n4.4\n Administration; Amendment; Termination\nAll determinations under this Policy shall be made by the Committee, including \ndeterminations regarding how any recovery under this Policy is effected.  Any \ndeterminations of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive and need not be \nuniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy.\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time and may terminate this Policy at \nany time, in its discretion.\n4.5\n Other Recovery Rights\nAny right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies \nor rights of recovery that may be available to the Firm under applicable law, regulation or \nrule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Firm or any provision in any employment \nagreement, equity award agreement, compensation plan, or any other agreement or \narrangement.\n5.
