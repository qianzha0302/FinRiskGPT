Our U.S. depository \ninstitution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank \nUSA), is a New York State-chartered bank.\nOur Business Segments\nWe manage and report our activities in three business \nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth \nManagement and Platform Solutions. Global Banking & \nMarkets generates revenues from investment banking fees, \nincluding advisory, and equity and debt underwriting fees, \nFixed \nIncome, \nCurrency \nand \nCommodities \n(FICC) \nintermediation \nand \nfinancing \nactivities \nand \nEquities \nintermediation \nand \nfinancing \nactivities, \nas \nwell \nas \nrelationship lending and acquisition financing (and related \nhedges) and investing activities related to our Global Banking \n& Markets activities. Asset & Wealth Management generates \nrevenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, \nprivate banking and lending, equity investments and debt \ninvestments. Platform Solutions generates revenues from \nconsumer platforms and transaction banking and other.  \nThe chart below presents our three business segments and \ntheir revenue sources. \nGlobal Banking & Markets\nGlobal Banking & Markets serves public and private sector \nclients and we seek to develop and maintain long-term \nrelationships with a diverse global group of institutional \nclients, including corporations, governments, states and \nmunicipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional \nclients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with our \nadvisory and underwriting activities serving as the main \ninitial point of contact. We make markets and facilitate client \ntransactions in fixed income, currency, commodity and \nequity products and offer market expertise on a global basis. \nIn addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions \non, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. \nOur clients include companies that raise capital and funding \nto grow and strengthen their businesses, and engage in \nmergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense, \nrestructurings and spin-offs, as well as companies that are \nprofessional market participants, who buy and sell financial \nproducts and manage risk, and investment entities whose \nultimate clients include individual investors investing for \ntheir retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n1\nAs a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally \nacross thousands of products in all major asset classes and \nmarkets. At times, we take the other side of transactions \nourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at \nother times we connect our clients to other parties who want \nto transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital \nand take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our \nclient relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and \nplay a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the \noverall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with \nour market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making \npositions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, \nor in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to \nactively manage our risk exposures that arise from these \nmarket-making activities (collectively, inventory). \nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in \nlarge, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. \nTreasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities). We also execute transactions for our \nclients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate \nbonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency \nmortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are \ngenerally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid \nmarkets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions \ninvolving customized or tailor-made products that address \nour clients’ risk exposures, investment objectives or other \ncomplex needs, as well as derivative transactions related to \nclient advisory and underwriting activities.\nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships \nwith our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment \nresearch, trading ideas, market information and analysis. \nMuch of this connectivity between us and our clients is \nmaintained on technology platforms, including Marquee, and \noperates globally where markets are open for trading. \nMarquee provides institutional investors with market \nintelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade \nexecution across multiple asset classes.\nOur businesses are supported by our Global Investment \nResearch business, which, as of December 2024, provided \nfundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies \nworldwide and on approximately 50 national economies, as \nwell as on industries, currencies and commodities.\nOur activities are organized by asset class and include both \n“cash” and “derivative” instruments. “Cash” refers to trading \nthe underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of \noil). “Derivative” refers to instruments that derive their value \nfrom underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and \nother inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an \noption, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain \nbond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at \na certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the \nagreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating \nrate or vice versa). \nGlobal Banking & Markets generates revenues from the \nfollowing: \nInvestment banking fees.

Employees are \nreviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees whom \nthey supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral \nto our team approach and includes an evaluation of an \nemployee’s performance. Our approach to evaluating \nemployee performance centers on providing robust, timely \nand \nactionable \nfeedback \nthat \nfacilitates \nprofessional \ndevelopment. We have directed our managers, as leaders at \nthe firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We \nalso engage in “The Three Conversations at GS” through \nwhich managers establish goals with their team members at \nthe start of the year, check in mid-year on progress and then \nclose out the year with a conversation on performance \nagainst goals.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n6\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe believe that our people value opportunities to contribute \nto their communities and that these opportunities enhance \ntheir job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to \nvolunteer together with colleagues and support community \norganizations through completing local service projects \nstrengthens our people’s bond with us. Community \nTeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables \nour people to participate in high-impact, team-based \nvolunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with \nhundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. \nDuring 2024, our people volunteered approximately 103,000 \nhours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, \nwith approximately 19,000 employees partnering with 660 \nnonprofit organizations on approximately 1,400 community \nprojects.   \nWellness \nWe recognize that for our people to be successful in the \nworkplace they need support in their personal, as well as \ntheir professional, lives and that is why our wellness \nframework is designed to promote health and fitness, \nresilience, and work-life balance. We provide a number of \npolicies for our employees that support taking time away \nfrom the office when needed, including a minimum of 20 \nweeks of parental leave and up to four weeks of family care \nleave in order to assist with the care of family members with \na serious health condition, death of an immediate family \nmember or miscarriage, in addition to bereavement leave. We \nallow managing directors to take time off without a fixed \nvacation day entitlement, and have also set a minimum \nannual expected vacation usage of 15 days for all employees. \nFor longer-tenured employees, we offer an unpaid sabbatical \nleave. \nWe also continue to advance our resilience programs, \noffering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical \nadvisory and personal wellness services. We have introduced \nand globally scaled the internationally recognized Mental \nHealth First Aid certification to our people. As of December \n2024, over 1,300 employees were certified across the firm, \nsurpassing our goal to train 1,000 Mental Health First Aiders \nby the end of 2024. We have evolved and strengthened virtual \nofferings to enhance access to support, with the aim of \nmaintaining the physical and mental well-being of our \npeople, and enhancing their effectiveness and productivity. \nWe also launched a manager mental health training to help \nsupport leaders globally, achieving a completion rate of \napproximately 85%.\nWe understand the crucial role caregiving plays in the lives of \nour employees. To help enable employees to better balance \ntheir roles at work and their responsibilities at home, we \noffer a variety of family-centered benefits, including adoption \nand surrogacy stipends, as well as adult or childcare options \nto help our people navigate caregiving across various life \nstages. Employees also have access to our family care \ncoordination services for comprehensive support and \ncoaching across the caregiving continuum—from their \ntransition to new parenthood to care for adult family \nmembers.\nIn addition, to support the financial wellness of our \nemployees, we offer a variety of resources that help them \nmanage their personal financial health and decision-making, \nincluding financial education information sessions, live and \non-demand webinars, articles and interactive digital tools.\nGlobal Reach and Strategic Locations\nAs a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic \napproach to attracting, developing and managing a global \nworkforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an \nactive participant in financial markets around the world. As \nof December 2024, we had headcount of 46,500, offices in \nover 40 countries, and 50% of our headcount was based in \nthe Americas, 20% in Europe, Middle East and Africa \n(EMEA) and 30% in Asia. Our employees come from over \n190 countries and speak more than 170 languages as of \nDecember 2024.\nIn addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers \naround the world, we have established key strategic \nlocations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, \nSingapore, Warsaw, Birmingham and Hyderabad. We \ncontinue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, \nincluding cities in which we do not currently have a presence.\nAs of December 2024, 43% of our employees were working \nin strategic locations. We believe our investment in these \nstrategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence \naround specific capabilities that support our business \ninitiatives.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n7\nSustainability \nWe have a long-standing commitment to sustainability. Our \ntwo priorities in this area are helping clients across industries \ndecarbonize their businesses to support their transitions to a \nlow-carbon economy (Climate Transition) and to advance \nsolutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive \noutcomes to support sustainable economic growth (Inclusive \nGrowth). Our strategy is to advance these two priorities \nthrough our work with our clients, and with strategic \npartners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our \nown, as well as through our supply chain.\nOur Sustainable Finance Group serves as the centralized \ngroup that drives our sustainability strategy and related \nefforts across our firm, including the commercial approach \nalongside our businesses, to advance Climate Transition and \nInclusive Growth. Our sustainable finance-related efforts \ncontinue to evolve. For example, within Global Banking & \nMarkets, we established the Sustainable Banking Group, a \ngroup focused on delivering analysis, advice, and capital \nsolutions for clients focused on their sustainability objectives. \nWithin Asset & Wealth Management, we provide clients \nsustainability-related capabilities, across public and private \nmarkets and open architecture, proprietary and third-party \nproducts, portfolio strategy and implementation, and \nspecialist sustainability teams and strategies.\nOur activities relating to sustainability present both financial \nand nonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing \nthese risks, similar to the other risks we face. We have \nintegrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk \nmanagement governance structure, from senior management \nto our Board and its committees, including the Risk and \nPublic Responsibilities committees. The Risk Committee of \nthe Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, \nwhich include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, \nreceives updates on our risk management approach to climate \nrisk. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board \nassists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide \nsustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, \nincluding with respect to climate change. As part of its \noversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives \nperiodic updates on our sustainability strategy and \ndisclosures, and also periodically reviews our governance and \nrelated policies and processes for climate and other \nsustainability-related matters. We have also implemented the \nEnvironmental & Social Due Diligence Guidelines to guide \nour overall risk-based due diligence approach when \nevaluating relevant transactions for environmental and social \nrisks and impacts. \nRelevant employees also receive training with respect to \nenvironmental and social risks, including for sectors and \nindustries that we believe have higher potential for these \nrisks. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk \nManagement — Other Risk Management — Climate-Related \nand Environmental Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of \nthis Form 10-K for further information about our climate-\nrelated and environmental risk management.\nAs a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the \nimportance of Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth for \nour business. We have completed sustainability debt \nissuances, which align with our sustainable finance \nframework and fund a range of on-balance sheet sustainable \nfinance activity. We believe we can advance sustainability by \npartnering with our clients across our businesses, including \nby developing new sustainability-linked financing solutions, \noffering strategic advice, or co-investing alongside our clients \nin energy companies. We have announced a target to deploy \n$750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory \nactivity by the beginning of 2030. As of December 2024, we \nachieved over 80% of that goal, with the majority dedicated \nto Climate Transition. \nWith respect to Climate Transition, we have announced our \ngoal to align our financing activities with a net-zero-by-2050 \npathway. We have an initial set of 2030 targets for our \nenergy, power and auto manufacturing portfolios, three \nsectors where we see an opportunity to proactively engage \nour clients and investors, deploy capital required for \ntransition, and invest in new commercial solutions to \nfacilitate decarbonization in the real economy. Carbon \nneutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm. We \nhave been carbon neutral in our operations and business \ntravel since 2015 through a combination of emissions \nreduction efforts and the procurement of Energy Attribute \nCertificates and third-party-verified carbon offsets. We have \nsince expanded our operational carbon commitment to \ninclude our supply chain, prioritizing emissions reductions.  \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n8\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to \nsustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth where we seek \nto help drive solutions that expand access, increase \naffordability, and support outcomes to advance sustainable \neconomic growth. Commercial solutions that seek to support \nInclusive Growth include, among others, those of our Urban \nInvestment Group and our Sustainable Investing Group. We \nalso seek to support Inclusive Growth through our corporate \nengagement programs, such as 10,000 Small Businesses, \n10,000 Women and One Million Black Women. These efforts \nare further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we \nhave established in areas where we have identified gaps or \nbelieve we are able to drive even greater impact through \ncollaboration. We believe our ability to achieve our \nsustainability objectives is critically dependent on the \nstrengths and talents of our people. See “Business — Human \nCapital Management” for information about our human \ncapital management programs and policies.\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are \nintensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our \ncompetitors provide investment banking, market-making and \nasset management services, private banking and lending, \ncommercial lending, credit cards, transaction banking, \ndeposit-taking and other banking products and services, and \nmake investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real \nestate, loans and other financial assets. Our competitors \ninclude brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, \ncommercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, \ninvestment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private \nequity funds, private credit funds, merchant banks and \nfinancial technology and other internet-based companies. \nSome of our competitors operate globally and others \nregionally, and we compete based on a number of factors, \nincluding transaction execution, client experience, products \nand services, innovation, reputation and price. \nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to \nretain market share by committing capital to businesses or \ntransactions on terms that offer returns that may not be \ncommensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate \nclients seek such commitments (such as agreements to \nparticipate in their loan facilities) from financial services \nfirms in connection with investment banking and other \nassignments.\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased \nthe capital base and geographic reach of some of our \ncompetitors and have also hastened the globalization of the \nsecurities and other financial services markets. As a result, we \nhave had to commit capital to support our international \noperations and to execute large global transactions. To \ncapitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we \nwill have to compete successfully with financial institutions \nthat are larger and have more capital and that may have a \nstronger local presence and longer operating history outside \nthe U.S.\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more \ntargeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some \nclients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to \npotential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described \nbelow, our ability to effectively compete with them could be \naffected by regulations and limitations on activities that \napply to us but may not apply to them.\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price \ncompetition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share \nhave resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, \nmarket-making, consumer, wealth management and asset \nmanagement businesses. For example, the increasing volume \nof trades executed electronically, through the internet and \nthrough alternative trading systems, has increased the \npressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for \nelectronic trading are generally lower than those for non-\nelectronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-\ncommission trading will continue. Price competition has also \nled to compression in the difference between the price at \nwhich a market participant is willing to sell an instrument \nand the price at which another market participant is willing \nto buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our \nmarket-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of \npassive investment strategies that typically have lower fees \nthan other strategies we offer has affected the competitive \nand pricing dynamics for our asset management products and \nservices. In addition, we believe that we will continue to \nexperience competitive pressures in these and other areas in \nthe future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market \nshare by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or \nexpand our presence in markets that rely more heavily on \nelectronic trading and execution. We and other banks also \ncompete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer. \nHigher short-term interest rates in recent years have resulted \nin and may continue to result in more intense competition in \ndeposit pricing, as well as competition from non-deposit \nfinancial products. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n9\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial \nproducts and client experiences that we and our competitors \noffer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer \nfinancial products that we do not offer and that our clients \nmay prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital \nassets that we cannot or may choose not to provide. Our \ncompetitors may also develop technology platforms that \nprovide a better client experience.\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the \nrequirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on \nBanking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial \nregulations could affect our competitive position to the \nextent that limitations on activities, increased fees and \ncompliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not \napply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or \nare not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. \nFor example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that \nprohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in \ncertain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between \nU.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and \ngive non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility \nto trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds \noutside the U.S. \nLikewise, the obligations with respect to derivative \ntransactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, \nin part, on the location of the counterparties to the \ntransaction. The impact of regulatory developments on our \ncompetitive position has depended and will continue to \ndepend to a large extent on the manner in which the required \nrulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of \ninternational convergence, and the development of market \npractice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, \nas described further in “Regulation” below. \nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining \nqualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete \neffectively has depended and will continue to depend upon \nour ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our \nexisting employees and to continue to compensate employees \ncompetitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on \nthe compensation practices of large financial institutions, \nincluding in jurisdictions such as New York State where we \nare required to publish certain compensation information as \npart of the employee hiring process. Our pay practices and \nthose of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, \nand the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and \noutside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation \nAuthority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \nin the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions \nwhose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. \nSee “Regulation — Compensation Practices” and “Risk \nFactors — Competition — Our businesses would be \nadversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified \nemployees” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further \ninformation about such regulation.\nRegulation\nAs a participant in the global financial services industry, we \nare subject to extensive regulation and supervision \nworldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our \noperations have been, and continue to be, subject to \nsignificant changes.  \nNew regulations have been adopted or are being considered \nby regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described \nbelow. The impacts of any changes to the regulations \naffecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals \ndescribed below, are uncertain and will not be known until \nsuch changes are finalized and market practices and \nstructures develop under the revised regulations. \nGroup Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company \nAct of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the \nBHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of \n1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and \nexamination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator. \nUnder the system of “functional regulation” established \nunder the GLB Act, the primary regulators of our U.S. non-\nbank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those \nsubsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such \n“functionally regulated” subsidiaries include broker-dealers \nand security-based swap dealers registered with the SEC, \nsuch as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, entities registered \nwith or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related \nand swaps-related activities and investment advisers \nregistered with the SEC with respect to their investment \nadvisory activities.\nOur principal subsidiaries operating in the U.S. include GS \nBank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co., LLC (GS&Co.), J. Aron \n& Company LLC (J. Aron) and Goldman Sachs Asset \nManagement, L.P.\nGS Bank USA is our principal U.S. bank subsidiary and is \nsupervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New \nYork State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GS Bank \nUSA also has a London branch, which is regulated by the \nFCA and PRA. We conduct a number of our activities \npartially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its \nsubsidiaries, including: corporate loans (including leveraged \nlending); securities-based and collateralized loans; credit card \nloans; residential mortgages; transaction banking; deposit-\ntaking; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; \nand agency lending. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n10\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nGS&Co. is our principal U.S. broker-dealer and is registered \nas a broker-dealer, a security-based swap dealer, a municipal \nadvisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a \nbroker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. \nU.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the \nNYSE, have adopted rules that apply to broker-dealers, such \nas GS&Co.  \nOur principal subsidiaries operating in Europe include: \nGoldman Sachs International (GSI), Goldman Sachs \nInternational \nBank \n(GSIB), \nGoldman \nSachs \nAsset \nManagement International (GSAMI), Goldman Sachs Bank \nEurope SE (GSBE), Goldman Sachs Asset Management B.V., \nand Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC). \nOur E.U. subsidiaries are subject to various E.U. regulations, \nas well as national laws, including those implementing \nEuropean directives. GSBE is directly supervised by the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and \nDeutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single \nSupervisory Mechanism. GSBE engages in certain activities \nprimarily in the E.U., including underwriting and market \nmaking in debt and equity securities and derivatives, \ninvestment, asset and wealth management services, deposit-\ntaking, lending (including securities lending), and financial \nadvisory services. GSBE is also registered with the CFTC as a \nswap dealer and with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer \nand as a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. \nsovereigns. Like our other foreign bank subsidiaries, GSBE is \nsubject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under \nthe FRB’s Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting \nand market making in equity securities based on GSBE’s and/\nor GS Bank USA’s capital.\nGSPIC is an investment firm under the French Prudential \nSupervision and Resolution Authority and the French \nFinancial Markets Authority. GSPIC’s activities include \ncertain activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. \nGSPIC is subject to the E.U. Investment Firm Regulation, the \nprudential regime for E.U. investment firms. \nGSI is a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, \nand GSIB is a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by \nthe PRA and the FCA. As a designated investment firm, GSI \nis subject to prudential requirements similar to those \napplicable to banks, including capital and liquidity \nrequirements. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and \nfrom the U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap \ndealer and with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. \nGSIB engages in lending (including securities lending) and \ndeposit-taking activities (including by taking retail deposits) \nand is a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and \nGSIB maintain branches outside of the U.K. and are subject \nto the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are \nlocated. \nOur principal subsidiary operating in Asia is Goldman Sachs \nJapan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). GSJCL is our regulated Japanese \nbroker-dealer subsidiary and is regulated by Japan’s \nFinancial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the \nBank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\nThe Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter \nfor prudential bank regulation. However, the Basel \nCommittee’s standards do not become effective in a \njurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules \nto implement its standards. The implications of Basel \nCommittee standards and related regulations for our \nbusinesses depend to a large extent on their implementation \nby the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices \nand structures that develop.\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank \nUSA are subject to risk-based regulatory capital and leverage \nrequirements that are calculated in accordance with the \nregulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital \nFramework is largely based on the Basel Committee’s \nframework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and \nrisk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements \ncertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. \nfederal bank regulatory agencies’ tailoring framework, we \nand GS Bank USA are subject to “Category I” standards \nbecause we have been designated as a global systemically \nimportant bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA \nare “Advanced approach” banking organizations. Under the \nCapital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific \nregulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative \nmeasures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet \nitems. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to \nqualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA \nare also subject to liquidity requirements established by the \nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements \nprescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as \namended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements \nDirective, as amended (CRD), which are largely based on \nBasel III. \nGSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity \nframeworks prescribed in the PRA Rulebook and the U.K. \nCapital Requirements Regulation, which are also largely \nbased on Basel III and are generally aligned with the E.U. \ncapital and liquidity frameworks. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n11\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios. As Advanced approach \nbanking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate risk-\nbased capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized \nand Advanced Capital Rules. Both the Standardized and \nAdvanced Capital Rules include minimum risk-based capital \nrequirements and additional capital conservation buffer \nrequirements that must be satisfied solely with Common \nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer \nrequirement in full would result in constraints on capital \ndistributions and discretionary executive compensation. The \nseverity of the constraints would depend on the amount of \nthe shortfall and the organization’s “eligible retained \nincome,” defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four \npreceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax \neffects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net \nincome over the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., the \ncapital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% \nbuffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital \nbuffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and \nboth a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB surcharge (under \nboth Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital \nconservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer \nand the countercyclical capital buffer. \nIn 2023, the FRB issued a proposal to implement a revised G-\nSIB assessment methodology and to revise certain systemic \nindicators to be based on daily or monthly average values \nduring each year, instead of year-end values. \nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve’s \nsupervisory stress tests and our planned common stock \ndividends and can change significantly over time based on the \nresults of the annual supervisory stress tests. See “Stress Tests \nand Capital Planning” below. The countercyclical capital \nbuffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and \ncurrently applies only to banking organizations subject to \nCategory I, II or III standards, including us and GS Bank \nUSA. Several other national supervisors also require \ncountercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB surcharge and \ncountercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in \nthe future, including due to additional guidance from our \nregulators and/or positional changes. As a result, the \nminimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to \nchange over time.\nThe capital requirements applicable to GSBE, GSI and GSIB \ninclude both minimum requirements and buffers. See \n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition \nand \nResults \nof \nOperations \n— \nCapital \nManagement and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of \nthis Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial \nstatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for \ninformation about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank \nUSA, GSBE, GSI and GSIB. \nThe Basel Committee standards include guidelines for \ncalculating incremental capital ratio requirements for \nbanking institutions that are systemically significant from a \ndomestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). Depending on \nhow these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, \nthey may apply to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs. These \nguidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but \nare more principles-based. The U.S. federal bank regulatory \nagencies have not designated any D-SIBs. The CRD and CRR \nprovide that institutions that are systemically important at \nthe E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically \nimportant institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional \ncapital ratio requirements, according to their degree of \nsystemic importance (O-SII buffers). BaFin has identified \nGSBE as an O-SII in Germany and set an O-SII buffer. \nIn the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group \nUK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, \nas an O-SII but has not applied an O-SII buffer. \nThe Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the Basel III \nCapital Requirements (Basel III Revisions), and in 2023, the \nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies proposed a rule \nimplementing the Basel III Revisions, including the \nFundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). The \nFRTB, among other things, revises the standardized and \ninternal model-based approaches used to calculate market \nrisk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject \nto market risk capital requirements.  \nThe U.S. proposal has a three-year transition period for the \ncalculation of Expanded Risk-Based approach risk-weighted \nassets (RWAs). The proposal includes the replacement of the \nAdvanced approach with an Expanded Risk-Based approach, \nwhich eliminates the use of internal models to calculate \nRWAs for credit and operational risk. The proposal \nincorporates the application of the SCB requirements in the \nExpanded Risk-Based approach. The credit risk component \nof the Expanded Risk-Based approach would include new \nrisk weights for many counterparty and exposure types, a \nrevised collateral haircut approach for certain collateralized \ntransactions and additional restrictions for recognizing \ncollateral in certain securities financing transactions. Under \nthe proposed rules, the RWAs for operational risk would be \ncalculated primarily based on revenues and historical losses. \nIn addition, the proposal introduces the FRTB, which would \nreplace the market risk rule for both the Standardized and \nExpanded Risk-Based approaches and introduce a new credit \nvaluation adjustment (CVA) risk RWA calculation for the \nExpanded Risk-Based approach. The FRB has indicated that \nit expects to work with the other U.S. federal bank regulatory \nagencies in 2025 on a revised proposal.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n12\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn 2024, the E.U. adopted rules to implement the Basel III \nRevisions through amendments to the CRR and the CRD, \nreferred to as CRR III and CRD VI. The amendments include \nthe FRTB rules, revised rules for credit risk capital, a new \nstandardized approach for operational risk and CVA risk \ncapital and a floor on internally modeled capital \nrequirements at a percentage of the capital requirements \nunder the standardized approach, commonly known as the \n“output floor.” Substantial parts of these rules became \neffective in January 2025, though certain provisions applied \nbeginning in July 2024. The FRTB rules are currently \nexpected to apply from January 2026. \nThe PRA issued near final rules with a proposed effective \ndate of January 1, 2027, implementing Basel III Revisions, \nincluding new rules covering the FRTB, credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, CVA risk and operational risk for \nthe U.K. Under the PRA near final rules, our U.K. \nsubsidiaries are not expected to be subject to a floor on \ninternally modeled capital requirements. \nThe Basel Committee has published an updated securitization \nframework and a revised G-SIB assessment methodology. \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ July 2023 \nproposal would implement the updated securitization \nframework. The updated securitization framework has been \nimplemented in the E.U. and U.K.\nThe Basel Committee has also published a final standard on \nthe prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures. The Basel \nCommittee contemplates that national regulators will have \nincorporated the standard into local capital requirements by \nJanuary 1, 2026. U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and \nE.U. and U.K. authorities have not yet proposed rules \nimplementing the standards.\nLeverage Ratios. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS \nBank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and \nsupplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) established by the FRB. \nAs a G-SIB, the SLR requirements applicable to us include \nboth a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement, \nwhich operates in the same manner as the risk-based buffer \nrequirements described above.  \nGSBE and certain of our U.K. entities are also subject to \nrequirements relating to leverage ratios, which are generally \nbased on the Basel Committee leverage ratio standards.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition \nand \nResults \nof \nOperations \n— \nCapital \nManagement and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of \nthis Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial \nstatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for \ninformation about our and GS Bank USA’s Tier 1 leverage \nratios and SLRs, and GSI’s leverage ratio.\nLiquidity Ratios. The Basel Committee’s framework for \nliquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring \nrequires banking organizations to measure their liquidity \nagainst two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage \nRatio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). \nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory \nagencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is \ngenerally consistent with the Basel Committee’s framework \nand is designed to ensure that a banking organization \nmaintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality \nliquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash \noutflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. \nWe and GS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum \nLCR of 100%. \nGSBE is subject to the LCR rule approved by the European \nParliament and Council, and GSI and GSIB are subject to the \nU.K. regulatory authorities’ LCR rules, which are generally \nconsistent with the Basel Committee’s framework. \nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term \nstable funding of the assets and off-balance sheet activities of \nbanking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The \nBasel Committee’s NSFR framework requires banking \norganizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. We \nand GS Bank USA are subject to the U.S. NSFR rule. \nThe CRR implements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial \ninstitutions, including GSBE. The NSFR requirement \nimplemented in the U.K. is applicable to both GSI and GSIB.\nThe FRB’s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with \n$100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply \nwith enhanced liquidity and overall risk management \nstandards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid \nassets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and \nincreased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and \noverall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement \nunder these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a \nseparate requirement. GSBE also has its own liquidity \nplanning process, which incorporates internally designed \nstress tests and those required under German regulatory \nrequirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Liquidity \nAdequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSI and GSIB have \ntheir own liquidity planning processes, which incorporate \ninternally designed stress tests developed in accordance with \nthe guidelines of the PRA’s ILAAP.\nSee “Available Information” below and “Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results \nof Operations — Risk Management — Overview and \nStructure of Risk Management” and “— Liquidity Risk \nManagement — Liquidity Regulatory Framework” in Part II, \nItem 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and \nNSFR, as well as our risk management practices and \nliquidity. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n13\nStress \nTests \nand \nCapital \nPlanning. \nThe \nFRB’s \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is \ndesigned to ensure that large BHCs, including us, have \nsufficient capital to permit continued operations during times \nof economic and financial stress. As required by the FRB, we \nperform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the \nresults into an annual capital plan, which we submit to the \nFRB for review. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis \nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital \nManagement \nand \nRegulatory \nCapital \n— \nCapital \nManagement — Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process” \nin Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information \nabout our annual capital plan. As described in “Available \nInformation” below, summary results of the annual stress test \nare published on our website. \nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to \nmake capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic \nand company-specific assumptions, based on our and the \nFRB’s own stress tests. In December 2024 and February 2025, \nthe FRB indicated that it intends to propose significant \nchanges to the stress test framework in 2025 and, for the 2025 \nstress test, take steps to reduce the volatility of results and to \nbegin to improve model transparency. Also in December \n2024, trade groups representing major U.S. banks, including \nus, filed a lawsuit against the FRB concerning certain \ninadequacies with its stress testing process.\nUnder the FRB’s rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or \nmore in total consolidated assets, including us, the SCB \napplies to the Standardized approach capital requirements. \nThe SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress \ntests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of \nplanned common stock dividends. The SCB, which is subject \nto a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each \nyear and remains in effect until October 1 of the following \nyear, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of \na capital plan. See “Available Information” below and \n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition \nand \nResults \nof \nOperations \n— \nCapital \nManagement and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of \nthis Form 10-K for information about our SCB requirement.\nThe SCB rule requires a BHC to receive the FRB’s approval \nfor any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital \ndistribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly \nissued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit \nits capital plan, which may occur if the BHC determines there \nhas been or will be a “material change” in its risk profile, \nfinancial condition or corporate structure since the plan was \nlast submitted, or if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and \nresubmit its capital plan. \nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of \n$250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs, such \nas GS Bank USA, are required to submit annual company-run \nstress test results to the FRB. GSBE also has its own capital \nand stress testing process, which incorporates internally \ndesigned stress tests and those required under German \nregulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal \nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, \nGSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress \ntesting processes, which incorporate internally designed stress \ntests developed in accordance with the PRA’s ICAAP \nguidelines.\nLimitations on the Payment of Dividends. U.S. federal \nand state laws impose limitations on the payment of \ndividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank \nUSA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by \nGS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts \ncalculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided \nprofits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may \nnot be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity \nin any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net \nincome combined with the retained net income of the two \npreceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory \napproval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may \nnot be paid in excess of the entity’s undivided profits \n(generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid \nout as dividends or transferred to surplus), unless the entity \nreceives regulatory and stockholder approval. \nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to \nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking \nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute \nan unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial \ncondition of the banking organization.\nSource of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to \nact as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and \nto commit capital and financial resources to support those \nsubsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at \ntimes when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide \nit. Capital loans by a BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are \nsubordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain \nother indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a \nBHC commits to a U.S. federal bank regulatory agency that it \nwill maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in \nresponse to the FRB’s invoking its source-of-strength \nauthority or in response to other regulatory measures, that \ncommitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for \nthe BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in \nrespect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the \nBHC. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n14\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTransactions Between Affiliates. Transactions between \nGS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, including GSBE, and Group \nInc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to \nrestrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations \nissued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit \nthe types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and \nother credit extensions, including credit exposure arising \nfrom resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative \ntransactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group \nInc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of \nassets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or \nits other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and \ngenerally require those transactions, to the extent permitted, \nto be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its \nsubsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not \napply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its \nsubsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory requirements \nprovide that certain transactions between GSBE and GS Bank \nUSA or its other affiliates, including Group Inc., must be on \nmarket terms and are subject to special internal approval \nrequirements. PRA rules also provide requirements for \ntransactions between GSI and GSIB and their respective \naffiliates.\nResolution and Recovery Plans. We are required by the \nFRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid \nand orderly resolution in the event of material financial \ndistress or failure (resolution plan). If these regulators jointly \ndetermine that an institution has failed to remediate \nidentified deficiencies in its resolution plan or that its \nresolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not \ncredible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under \nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may jointly impose more \nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or \nrestrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly \norder the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to \nfacilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. The FRB \nand FDIC require U.S. G-SIBs to submit resolution plans \nevery two years (alternating between submissions of full \nplans \nand \ntargeted \nplans \nthat \ninclude \nonly \nselect \ninformation). We submitted our 2023 resolution plan, which \nwas a full submission, in June 2023. In June 2024, the FRB \nand the FDIC provided feedback on our 2023 resolution plan \nand identified one shortcoming, other areas for additional \nfocus to address resolution readiness and additional \ninformation required to be included in our 2025 resolution \nplan. In August 2024, we submitted a description of our key \nactions to address the shortcoming. Our next required \nsubmission is a targeted submission by July 1, 2025. See \n“Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory — The application of \nGroup Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy could result in \ngreater losses for Group Inc.’s security holders” in Part I, \nItem 1A of this Form 10-K and “Available Information” in \nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about \nour resolution plan.\nWe are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic \nbasis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we \ncould take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and \nconserve capital in times of prolonged stress. Certain of our \nsubsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan \nrequirements in their local jurisdictions.\nGS Bank USA is required to provide a resolution plan to the \nFDIC that must, among other things, demonstrate that it is \nadequately protected from risks arising from our other \nentities. GS Bank USA’s most recent resolution plan was \nsubmitted in December 2023. In June 2024, the FDIC adopted \nrevisions to its rule that requires the submission of resolution \nplans by insured depository institutions (IDIs) with $50 \nbillion or more in total assets. These revisions modify the \nrequirements regarding the content and timing of resolution \nsubmissions, as well as interim supplements to those \nsubmissions provided to the FDIC. IDIs with $100 billion or \nmore in total assets, including GS Bank USA, are required to \nsubmit full resolution plans biennially. GS Bank USA’s next \nrequired full submission is due by July 1, 2026.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules \nimposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) \nentered into by G-SIBs. The rules are intended to facilitate \nthe orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability \nof the G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty \nwaives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the \nentry of the G-SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) \nthe contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the \ntransfer of such contract and/or any related credit \nenhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the \ncontract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set \nforth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority \n(OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), \ndescribed below. GS Bank USA has achieved compliance by \nadhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA \nUniversal Protocol) and International Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA \nProtocol) described below.\nCertain of our other subsidiaries also adhere to these \nprotocols. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on \ncertain cross-default and early termination rights within \nstandard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing \ntransactions between adhering parties in the event that one of \nthem is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, \nincluding a resolution under OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. \nThe U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA \nUniversal Protocol, was created to allow market participants \nto comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal \nbank regulatory agencies. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n15\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), \nas amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework for the \nrecovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., \nsuch as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory \nauthorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address \npotential financial crises in order to promote financial \nstability and minimize taxpayers’ exposure to losses. The \nBRRD requires E.U. member states to grant certain \nresolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. \nresolution authorities, including the power to impose a \ntemporary stay, and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing \ndown its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into \nequity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that \ncontracts governed by non-E.U. law recognize those \ntemporary stay and bail-in powers unless doing so would be \nimpracticable. GSBE is under the direct authority of the \nSingle Resolution Board for resolution planning. E.U. law \nrequires financial institutions in the E.U., including \nsubsidiaries of non-E.U. groups, to submit recovery plans and \nto assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing \nresolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE’s primary \nregulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it \nis also regulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank.  \nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the \nsame powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution \nauthority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. \nfinancial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial \ninstitutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the \nBank of England’s expectations contained in the U.K. \nResolution Assessment Framework, including with respect to \nloss absorbency, contractual stays, operational continuity \nand funding in resolution. They are also required by the PRA \nto submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be \nwound down in a stressed environment. The PRA is also the \nregulatory authority in the U.K. that supervises recovery \nplanning, and GSI and GSIB are each required to submit \nrecovery plans to the PRA.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB’s TLAC \nrule, among other things, establishes minimum TLAC \nrequirements and establishes minimum requirements for \n“eligible long-term debt” (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a \nmaturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies \ncertain additional criteria). In 2023, the FRB proposed to \nintroduce a minimum denomination requirement for eligible \nlong-term debt, among other changes.\nThe rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a \nU.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries’ liabilities that \nare subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters \ninto an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an \nexception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. \nfederal bank regulatory agencies imposing restrictions on \nQFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) \nissuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv) entering into \nderivatives and certain other financial contracts with external \ncounterparties.\nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent \ncompany’s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-\ncontingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-\nterm debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible \nlong-term debt.\nThe CRR, the BRRD and U.K. financial services regime also \nimpose minimum TLAC requirements on G-SIBs. For \nexample, the CRR requires E.U. subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-\nSIB that exceed the threshold of 5% of the G-SIB’s RWAs, \noperating income or leverage exposure, such as GSBE, to \nmeet requirements for the issuance of instruments to \nqualifying affiliates (internal TLAC) in order to be able to \ntransfer losses or otherwise recapitalize those subsidiaries. \nUnder the U.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds \nthe applicable thresholds and therefore, it is subject to \ninternal TLAC requirements.\nThe CRD requires a non-E.U. group with more than €40 \nbillion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to have an E.U. \nintermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) if it has, as in our \ncase, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution \nsubsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks. The ECB \ngranted GSBE and GSPIC an exemption to operate under two \nE.U. IHCs. The CRR requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital \nand liquidity requirements, a minimum requirement for own \nfunds and eligible liabilities (MREL), and certain other \nprudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has \nnot implemented a similar requirement to establish an IHC; \nhowever, the PRA requires that certain U.K. financial holding \ncompanies or a designated U.K. group entity be responsible \nfor the U.K. group’s regulatory compliance. We have \ndesignated GSI for that responsibility.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n16\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject \ninstitutions to a MREL, which is generally consistent with \nthe Financial Stability Board’s (FSB’s) TLAC standard. The \nSingle \nResolution \nBoard \nimposes \ninternal \nMREL \nrequirements applicable to GSBE. GSI is required to maintain \na minimum level of internal MREL and provide the Bank of \nEngland the right to exercise bail-in triggers over certain \nintercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments \nissued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to \nwrite down such instruments or convert such instruments to \nequity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England \nif it determines that GSI has reached the point of non-\nviability and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the \nbail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar \nproceedings. \nInsolvency of a BHC or IDI. The Dodd-Frank Act created a \nresolution regime, OLA, for BHCs and their affiliates that are \nsystemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be \nappointed as receiver for the systemically important \ninstitution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the \nrecommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary \nof the Treasury determines, among other things, that the \ninstitution is in default or in danger of default, that the \ninstitution’s failure would have serious adverse effects on the \nU.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would \navoid or mitigate those effects. \nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the \npowers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of \ncreditors and other parties who have dealt with the \ninstitution, would be determined under OLA, and not under \nthe bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise \napply. The powers of the receiver under OLA are generally \nbased on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository \ninstitutions under the FDIA, described below. \nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between \nOLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of \nthe FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of \ncreditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an \nadministrative claims procedure to determine creditors’ \nclaims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in \nbankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to \ntransfer claims to a “bridge” entity. In addition, OLA limits \nthe ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-\ndefaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. \nThe FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a \nfailed FHC by transferring its assets to a “bridge” holding \ncompany under its “single point of entry” or “SPOE” strategy \npursuant to OLA.\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or \nreceiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency \nor in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, \nincluding the power: \n• To transfer any of the IDI’s assets and liabilities to a new \nobligor, including a newly formed “bridge” bank, without \nthe approval of the depository institution’s creditors; \n• To enforce the IDI’s contracts pursuant to their terms \nwithout regard to any provisions triggered by the \nappointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n• To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which \nthe IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined \nby the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or \ndisaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to \npromote the orderly administration of the IDI.\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit \nliabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses \nagainst an IDI would be afforded a priority over other \ngeneral unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. \nbranches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the \n“liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by \nany receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever \nsought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, \nthe debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) \nwould be treated differently from, and could receive, if \nanything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. \nbranches of GS Bank USA. \nDeposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA have the \nbenefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The \nFDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on \nIDIs. GS Bank USA’s assessment (subject to adjustment by \nthe FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated \nassets less its average tangible equity during the assessment \nperiod, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking \nfinancial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. In \naddition, the FDIC must recover, by special assessment, \nlosses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of the \nFDIC’s use of the systemic risk exception to the least cost \nresolution test under the FDIA. See “Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results \nof Operations — Results of Operations — Operating \nExpenses” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for \ninformation about the estimated impact of the FDIC special \nassessment fee. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the \nGerman statutory deposit protection program to the extent \nprovided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate \nin the German voluntary deposit protection program which \nprovides further insurance for certain eligible deposits \nbeyond the coverage of the German statutory deposit \nprogram. Eligible deposits at GSIB and the London branch of \nGS Bank USA are covered by the U.K. Financial Services \nCompensation Scheme up to the applicable limits.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n17\nPrompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) \nrequires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take \n“prompt corrective action” in respect of depository \ninstitutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. \nFDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured \nbanks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately \ncapitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized \nand critically undercapitalized. \nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a \ncapital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital \nratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound \ncondition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination \nrating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes \nprogressively more restrictive constraints on operations, \nmanagement and capital distributions, as the capital category \nof an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital \nrequirements could also require a depository institution to \nraise \ncapital. \nUltimately, \ncritically \nundercapitalized \ninstitutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or \nconservator, as described in “Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC” \nabove.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to \nBHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate \naction at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized \nstatus of the BHC’s depository institution subsidiaries. In \ncertain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository \ninstitution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to \nguarantee \nthe \nperformance \nof \nthe \nundercapitalized \nsubsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for \ncivil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on \nthat guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy \nof the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the \nBHC’s general unsecured creditors, as described in “Source of \nStrength” above.\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a \nBHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business \nactivities in which we may engage. \nVolcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits “proprietary \ntrading,” but permits activities such as underwriting, market \nmaking and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive \ncompliance program and includes additional reporting and \nrecord-keeping requirements. \nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and \ninvestment in, “covered funds” (as defined in the rule) by \nbanking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of \ntransactions between us and our sponsored and advised \nfunds, similar to the limitations on transactions between \ndepository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds \ninclude our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real \nestate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment \nstructures. The limitation on investments in covered funds \nrequires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% \nor less of the fund’s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate \ninvestment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 \ncapital.\nOther Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage in a broader \nrange of financial and related activities than are otherwise \npermissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the \neligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of \npermissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing \nand making markets in securities and making investments in \nnon-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain \nFHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain \ncommodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be \nimpermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant \nto these activities do not equal 5% or more of their \nconsolidated assets. \nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC’s \nability to conduct activities that would otherwise be \npermissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not \nsatisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For \nexample, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution \nsubsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or \nwell-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or \nmanagerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or \nconditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be \nrequired to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries \nor to cease engaging in activities other than the business of \nbanking and certain closely related activities. \nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval \nbefore certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain \nbanking and other financial activities both within and outside \nthe U.S.\nU.S. G-SIBs, like us, are also required to comply with a rule \nregarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes \nmore stringent requirements for credit exposures to major \nfinancial institutions. \nThe New York State banking law imposes lending limits \n(which take into account credit exposure from derivative \ntransactions) and other requirements that have in the past \nimpacted and could in the future impact the manner and \nscope of GS Bank USA’s activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n18\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued \nguidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk \nmanagement frameworks and that outlines high-level \nprinciples for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including \nunderwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This \nguidance has, among other things, limited the percentage \namount of debt that can be included in certain transactions. \nAs a German credit institution, GSBE is subject to Volcker \nRule-type prohibitions under German banking law and \nregulations because its financial assets exceed certain \nthresholds. Prohibited activities include (i) proprietary \ntrading, (ii) high-frequency trading at a German trading \nvenue, and (iii) lending and guarantee businesses with \nGerman hedge funds, German funds of hedge funds or any \nnon-German substantially leveraged alternative investment \nfunds, unless an exclusion or an exemption applies.  \nAs part of its implementation of the Basel III Revisions, the \nE.U. introduced new restrictions on the provision of certain \n“core” banking services (i.e., deposit-taking, lending and the \nprovision of commitments and guarantees) cross-border into \nthe E.U. Contracts in place before June 2026 will be subject \nto a “grandfathering” provision and new core banking \nservices will need to be executed out of our subsidiaries \nestablished in the E.U., including GSBE.  \nU.K. banks that have over £35 billion of core retail deposits \nare required to separate their retail banking services from \ntheir investment and international banking activities, \ncommonly known as “ring-fencing.” GSIB is not currently \nsubject to the ring-fencing requirement. \nCRA. In 2023, GS Bank USA ceased to be assessed as a \n“wholesale bank” for CRA and New York Community \nReinvestment Act (NYCRA) compliance purposes. GS Bank \nUSA instead adopted a strategic plan that was approved by \nthe FRB and NYDFS. The 2023 strategic plan will be in effect \nthrough 2028. While the plan is in effect, its terms will not be \nimpacted by the revised federal CRA regulations, jointly \npublished by the FDIC, FRB, and OCC in 2023. The revised \nfederal CRA regulations tailor CRA evaluations to bank size \nand type, with many of the changes applying only to banks \nwith over $2 billion in assets and several applying only to \nbanks with over $10 billion in assets, including GS Bank \nUSA. A court has issued a preliminary injunction enjoining \nthe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies from enforcing the \nrevised regulations pending resolution of the lawsuit \nchallenging the regulations.\nThe CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or \nprograms for financial institutions nor does it limit an \ninstitution’s discretion to develop the types of products and \nservices that it believes are best suited to its particular \ncommunity, but depository institutions may only receive \nCRA credit for certain types of lending and for lending, \ninvestments \nand \nservices \nthat \nsupport \ncommunity \ndevelopment, as defined in the CRA regulations. The CRA \nand its regulations require each appropriate federal bank \nregulatory agency, in connection with its examination of a \ndepository institution, to assess such institution’s record of \nmeeting the credit needs of the communities served by that \ninstitution, including the needs of low- and moderate-income \nborrowers and neighborhoods, and to make such assessment \navailable to the public.\nThe assessment also is part of the FRB’s consideration of \napplications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another \nbanking institution or its holding company, to assume \ndeposits of or acquire assets from another depository \ninstitution, to establish a new domestic branch office that \nwill raise deposits, or to relocate an office. In the case of a \nBHC applying for approval to acquire a bank or another \nBHC, the FRB will assess the records of performance under \nthe CRA of the IDIs involved in the transaction, and such \nrecords may be the basis for denying the application. \nIf GS Bank USA fails to maintain at least a “satisfactory” \nrating under the CRA, we would be subject to restrictions on \ncertain new activities and acquisitions.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the New York Banking \nLaw that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon \nNew York State-chartered banks, such as GS Bank USA, to \nserve the credit needs of its local community (NYCRA). Such \nobligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the \nCRA. The NYCRA requires the NYDFS to make a periodic \nwritten assessment of an institution’s compliance with the \nNYCRA, and to make such assessment available to the \npublic. The NYCRA also requires the NYDFS to consider the \nNYCRA rating when reviewing an application to engage in \ncertain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and \nthe establishment of domestic branch offices, and provides \nthat such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of \nany such application.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n19\nBroker-Dealer and Securities Regulation\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are \nsubject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities \nbusiness, including sales methods, trade practices, the use and \nsafekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure, \nrecord-keeping, the financing of clients’ purchases, and the \nconduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the \nSEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration \nof the federal securities laws. \nU.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have \nregulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. For a \ndescription of net capital requirements applicable to \nGS&Co., see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital \nManagement and Regulatory Capital — Subsidiary Capital \nRequirements — U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries” \nin Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nThe SEC requires lenders of securities to provide the material \nterms of securities lending transactions to FINRA and for \nFINRA to make certain terms publicly available. Reporting \nunder this requirement will begin in January 2026.\nThe SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of \ntheir retail customers. SEC rules require broker-dealers to \nprovide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting \nservices offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and \ncosts, the differences between brokerage and advisory \nservices, and any conflicts of interest. In addition, several \nstates have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary \nduty standards applicable to broker-dealers.\nThe SEC has proposed four rules to reform the U.S. equity \nmarket structure, two of which have been adopted. In 2024, \nthe SEC adopted a rule, effective December 2025, to revise \nand expand reporting and disclosure requirements relating to \nexecution quality. In 2024, the SEC also adopted a rule to \nupdate the minimum pricing increments, with variable price \nincrements based on the trading characteristics of stocks. In \nDecember 2024, the SEC stayed the implementation of this \nrule, which would apply starting in November 2025, pending \nthe outcome of litigation challenging the rule.\nThe SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. \njurisdictions \nhave \nimposed \nboth \nconduct-based \nand \ndisclosure-based requirements with respect to research \nreports and research analysts and may impose additional \nregulations.\nThe SEC prohibits participants involved in the creation of \nasset-backed securities, including any underwriter, placement \nagent, initial purchaser or sponsor of an asset-backed security \n(or any affiliate or subsidiary), from engaging in any \ntransaction that involves or results in a material conflict of \ninterest between the securitization participant and an investor \nin an asset-backed security, including reducing its exposure to \nthe asset-backed securities, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe SEC requires that SEC-registered clearing agencies set up \npolicies and procedures that would, among other things, \nrequire many market participants to clear cash and \nrepurchase transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities \nthrough such a clearing agency by December 2025 for cash \ntransactions and by June 2026 for repurchase transactions.\nGS&Co. and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules \nadopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank \nAct that require any person who organizes or initiates certain \nasset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion \n(generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the \nperson conveys to a third party. For certain securitization \ntransactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy \nthis requirement. \nIn Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including \nthrough GSBE, GSPIC and GSI, that are subject to oversight \nby European and national regulators. These services are \nregulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and other national \nlaws and regulations. These laws require, among other \nthings, compliance with certain capital adequacy and \nliquidity standards, customer protection requirements and \nmarket conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our \nEuropean subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, \nderivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are \nmembers.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n20\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn the E.U. and the U.K., the Markets in Financial \nInstruments Directives (MiFID II) and the Markets in \nFinancial Instruments Regulations (MiFIR) (as amended \nfrom time to time, including the proposed amendments to \nMiFID II and MiFIR), have established trading venue \ncategories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to \ntrade OTC derivatives on a trading platform, established \nenhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wide \nrange of financial instruments, placed volume caps on non-\ntransparent liquidity trading for equities trading venues, \nlimited the use of broker-dealer equities crossing networks \nand created a regime for systematic internalizers in certain \nfinancial instruments (which are investment firms that \nexecute transactions outside a trading venue). Additional \ncontrol requirements apply to algorithmic trading, high \nfrequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities \ntrading firms are required to calculate their positions and \nadhere to specific position limits. MiFID II and MiFIR also \nrequire transaction reporting, transparency on costs and \ncharges to clients for portfolio management and investment \nadvice services, restrictions on the way investment managers \ncan pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting \nthe payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms \nof inducements, and rules addressing bundling for broker-\ndealers between execution and other major services. Certain \nof our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including GSBE, GSI and GSIB, \nare subject to E.U. and U.K. regulation applicable to \nsecuritization activities, which will require them to conduct \nupfront due diligence and ongoing monitoring in connection \nwith their investment in securitization positions and may \nimpose ongoing risk retention and transparency requirements \nwhere they are acting as a sponsor, original lender or \noriginator in respect of any E.U. or U.K. securitizations.\nGSJCL, our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to \ncapital requirements imposed by Japan’s Financial Services \nAgency.

As \na market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain \norderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.\nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation\nThe commodity futures, commodity options and swaps \nindustry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. \nCommodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. \nfederal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. \nIn addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with \nthe regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and \nregulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as \nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges \nand the National Futures Association (NFA), also govern \ncommodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities. \nThe terms “swaps” and “security-based swaps” include a \nwide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those \nconventionally referred to as swaps (including certain \nforward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety \nof underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, \ncommodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, \nsecurities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.\nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory \nclearing and execution of interest rate and credit default \nswaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to \nbusiness conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. A number \nof \nthese \nrequirements, \nparticularly \nthose \nregarding \nrecordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that \ndo not involve a registered swap dealer. GS&Co. and other \nsubsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and J. \nAron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. The \nCFTC has rules establishing capital requirements for swap \ndealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential \nregulator, such as the FRB. The CFTC also has financial \nreporting requirements for covered swap entities and capital \nrules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants that \nprovide explicit capital requirements for proprietary \npositions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not \ncleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered \nswap dealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC’s \ncapital requirements.\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the \nmargin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank \nswap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and \nGSBE). Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB \nmargin rules are generally exempt from initial margin \nrequirements.\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are also subject to \nNFA regulation, including requirements pertaining to \ncybersecurity and supervision, and the NFA examines them \nfor compliance with these requirements as well as compliance \nwith CFTC rules. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n21\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-\nbased swap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined as \nswaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-based \nbaskets or indices of securities. The SEC has adopted a \nnumber of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i) \ncapital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii) record-\nkeeping, financial reporting and notification requirements; \n(iii) business conduct standards; (iv) regulatory and public \ntrade reporting; and (v) the application of risk mitigation \ntechniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. \nGS&Co., GS Bank USA, GSI, GSBE and Goldman Sachs \nFinancial Markets, L.P. (GSFM) are registered with the SEC \nas security-based swap dealers and subject to the SEC’s \nregulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC has \nproposed additional regulations regarding security-based \nswaps that would, among other things, require public \nreporting of large positions in security-based swaps.\nGS Bank USA and GSBE are also subject to the FRB’s swaps \nmargin rules. These rules require the exchange of initial and \nvariation margin in connection with transactions in swaps \nand security-based swaps that are not cleared through a \nregistered or exempt clearinghouse. GS Bank USA and GSBE \nare required to post and collect margin in connection with \ntransactions with swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, \nmajor swap participants and major security-based swap \nparticipants, or financial end users.\nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to cross-\nborder regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, and \nbusiness conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC \nand the SEC have entered into agreements with certain non-\nU.S. regulators regarding the cross-border regulation of \nderivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border \nexecution facilities and clearinghouses, and have approved \nsubstituted compliance with certain non-U.S. regulations \nrelated to certain business conduct requirements and margin \nrules, among other requirements. The U.S. prudential \nregulators have not yet made a determination with respect to \nsubstituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S. \nmargin rules. \nSimilar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in \njurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and \nJapan. Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation \n(EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established \nregulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation \nand reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and \nmargining for uncleared derivatives activities. In addition, \nunder the European Markets in Financial Instruments \nDirective and Regulation, transactions in certain types of \nderivatives are required to be executed on regulated \nplatforms or exchanges.\nThe CFTC has adopted rules that limit the size of positions \nin physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any \nentity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading \nunder common ownership or control. The CFTC position \nlimits apply to futures on physical commodities and options \non such futures, apply to both physically and cash settled \npositions and to swaps that are economically equivalent to \nsuch futures and options. The position limit rules initially \nimpose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery \nperiod for the physical commodities, which is typically a \nperiod of several days). \nJ. Aron is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at \nmarket-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, \nJ. Aron is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power \nAct and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a \nresult of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an \n“exempt holding company” under the U.S. Public Utility \nHolding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules.\nIn addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities \nactivities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other \ngovernmental laws and regulations, as described in “Risk \nFactors — Legal and Regulatory — Our commodities \nactivities, particularly our physical commodities activities, \nsubject us to extensive regulation and involve certain \npotential risks, including environmental, reputational and \nother risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and \ncosts” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGS&Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission \nmerchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., \nare registered with the CFTC and act as commodity pool \noperators and commodity trading advisors. GSFM is \nregistered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer.\nAsset \nManagement \nand \nWealth \nManagement \nRegulation\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses \nare subject to extensive oversight by regulators around the \nworld relating to, among other things, the fair treatment of \nclients, safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, \nmarketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our \nmanagement of client funds. \nThe federal securities laws impose fiduciary duties on \ninvestment advisers, including GS&Co., Goldman Sachs \nAsset Management, L.P. and our other U.S. registered \ninvestment adviser subsidiaries, and SEC rules prescribe \nmandatory disclosures.\nThe SEC requires certain institutional investment managers \nthat meet or exceed certain specified reporting thresholds to \nreport on a monthly basis specific short position data and \nshort activity data for equity securities. Reporting under this \nrule was required beginning in January 2025.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n22\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn 2024, the SEC issued guidance addressing the rules \ngoverning \nliquidity \nrisk \nmanagement \nof \nopen-end \nmanagement investment companies, such as mutual funds, \nand adopted amendments to the reporting requirements for \ncertain registered investment companies, requiring such \ninvestment companies to, among other things, file reports \nabout their portfolios and each of their portfolio holdings on \na monthly basis within 30 days of the end of each month \n(compared to 60 days of the end of the fiscal quarter under \nthe previous rule) and, for open-end management investment \ncompanies such as mutual funds, to identify and provide \ncertain information about the service providers used to fulfill \nthe rules governing liquidity risk management. Compliance \nwith these amendments is required by November 17, 2025. \nTimely compliance with these accelerated or new reporting \nrequirements will require us to enhance systems and \ndisclosure controls and procedures.\nCertain of our European subsidiaries, including GSBE in the \nE.U. and GSAMI in the U.K., are subject to MiFID II and/or \nrelated regulations (including the U.K. legislation making \nsuch regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the \napproval, \norganizational, \nmarketing \nand \nreporting \nrequirements of E.U. or U.K.-based investment managers and \nthe ability of investment fund managers located outside the \nE.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. Goldman Sachs \nAsset Management BV is subject to similar requirements as a \nmanagement company licensed under the E.U. Undertakings \nfor Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) \nDirective and the E.U. Alternative Investment Fund \nManagers (AIFM) Directive with additional authorizations \nfor certain activities regulated under MiFID II. Our asset \nmanagement business in the E.U. and the U.K. significantly \ndepends on our ability to delegate parts of our activities to \nother affiliates.\nGSAMI is also subject to the prudential regime for U.K. \ninvestment firms, the Investment Firms Prudential Regime, \nwhich governs the prudential requirements for U.K. \ninvestment firms prudentially regulated by the FCA.\nConsumer Regulation\nOur U.S. consumer-oriented activities are subject to \nsupervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to \nfederal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to \nfair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or \nabusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or \nprovision of consumer financial products and services. Our \nconsumer-oriented activities are also subject to various state \nand local consumer protection laws, rules and regulations, \nwhich, among other things, impose obligations relating to \nmarketing, origination, servicing and collections activities in \nour consumer businesses. In addition, our U.K. consumer \ndeposit-taking activities are subject to U.K. consumer \nprotection laws and regulations.\nCompensation Practices\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the \nFRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and \nemployees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide. \nThe FSB has released standards for implementation by local \nregulators \nthat \nare \ndesigned \nto \nencourage \nsound \ncompensation practices at banks and other financial \ncompanies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have \nalso provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive \ncompensation arrangements at banking organizations take \ninto account risk and are consistent with safe and sound \npractices. The guidance sets forth the following three key \nprinciples \nwith \nrespect \nto \nincentive \ncompensation \narrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees \nwith incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial \nresults in a manner that does not encourage employees to \nexpose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the \narrangements should be compatible with effective controls \nand risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be \nsupported by strong corporate governance. The guidance \nprovides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive \ncompensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the \norganization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability \nto make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance \nalso notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a \nbanking \norganization \nif \nits \nincentive \ncompensation \narrangements or related risk management, control or \ngovernance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety \nand soundness. \nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, \nincluding the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based \npayment arrangements at specified regulated entities having \nat least $1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators \nproposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. \nIn accordance with an SEC rule, securities exchanges have \nadopted rules mandating, in the case of a restatement, the \nrecovery \nor \n“clawback” \nof \nexcess \nincentive-based \ncompensation paid to current or former executive officers \nand requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis \nwhere recovery is triggered by a restatement.\nThe NYDFS’ guidance emphasizes that any incentive \ncompensation arrangements tied to employee performance \nindicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS, \nincluding GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk \nmanagement, oversight and control.\nIn the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are \ndesigned to meet the FSB’s compensation standards. These \nprovisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of \nall employees at GSBE and of certain employees at our other \noperating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees \nidentified as having a material impact on the risk profile of \nregulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amended certain \naspects of these rules, including, by increasing minimum \nvariable compensation deferral periods. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n23\nThe E.U. and the U.K. have each also introduced investment \nfirm regimes, including rules regulating compensation for \ncertain persons providing services to certain investment \nfunds. \nAnti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and \nRegulations\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including by \nthe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Anti-Money \nLaundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), contains anti-money \nlaundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or \nmandates the promulgation of various regulations applicable \nto financial institutions, including standards for verifying \nclient identification at account opening, and obligations to \nmonitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. \nThrough these and other provisions, the BSA seeks, among \nother things, to promote the identification of parties that may \nbe involved in terrorism, money laundering or other \nsuspicious activities. \nThe AMLA was intended to comprehensively reform and \nmodernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other \nthings, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-\nmoney laundering compliance for financial institutions; \nrequires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to periodically \npromulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and \ncountering \nthe \nfinancing \nof \nterrorism; \nrequires \nthe \ndevelopment of standards by the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury for testing technology and internal processes for \nBSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-\nrelated authority, including a significant expansion in the \navailable sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands \nBSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Certain \nstatutory provisions in the AMLA require rulemakings \nbeyond those that have already been finalized, reports and \nother measures. The impact of the AMLA will depend on, \namong other things, these additional rulemakings and \nimplementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of \nTreasury, has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering \nand countering the financing of terrorism, as required under \nthe AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, \nterrorist \nfinancing, \nfraud, \ntransnational \ncrime, \ndrug \ntrafficking organization activity, human trafficking and \nproliferation financing.\nThe Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) was enacted in 2021 \nas part of the AMLA and designed to establish beneficial \nownership information reporting requirements for certain \ntypes of entities, and in 2024, FinCEN’s rule implementing \nthe reporting requirements of the CTA became effective. \nUnder the rule, domestic companies formed before 2024 \nwould be required to file their initial report by January 1, \n2025 and domestic companies formed in or after 2024 would \nbe required to file their initial report within, respectively, 90 \nor 30 days of their formation, in each case subject to certain \nexemptions. On February 19, 2025, FinCEN announced that \nthe earliest initial reporting deadline is March 21, 2025.\nIn 2024, FinCEN and the SEC proposed a rule that would \nrequire certain investment advisers to implement reasonable \nprocedures to identify and verify the identities of their \ncustomers. In 2024, FinCEN proposed to amend the anti-\nmoney laundering/countering the financing of terrorism \n(AML/CFT) \nprogram \nrequirements \nfor \nall \nfinancial \ninstitutions subject to the BSA that have AML/CFT program \nobligations, including us. The proposal would, among other \nthings, require a financial institution’s risk assessment \nprocess to identify, evaluate and document the financial \ninstitution’s money laundering, terrorist financing and other \nillicit activity risks, and update such risk assessments on a \nperiodic basis. In 2024, the U.S. federal bank regulatory \nagencies proposed amendments to their respective BSA \nprogram rules to align those rules with the FinCEN proposal. \nFinCEN has also adopted a rule, effective on January 1, 2026, \nthat includes certain investment advisers, such as us, in the \ndefinition of “financial institutions” under FinCEN’s rules \nimplementing the BSA and, among other things, prescribes \nminimum standards for AML/CFT programs to be \nestablished by such investment advisers and requires them to \nreport suspicious activity to FinCEN.\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide \nrelating to anti-money laundering and financial transparency, \nincluding the E.U. Anti-Money Laundering Directives. In \naddition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices \nAct (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws and \nregulations \nworldwide \nregarding \ncorrupt \nand \nillegal \npayments, or providing anything of value, for the benefit of \ngovernment officials and others. The scope of the types of \npayments or other benefits covered by these laws is very \nbroad. These laws and regulations include requirements \nrelating to the identification of clients, monitoring for and \nreporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and \nindirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing \ninformation to regulatory authorities and law enforcement \nagencies, and sharing information with other financial \ninstitutions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n24\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations \nrelating to the privacy of information regarding clients, \nemployees and others. These include, but are not limited to, \nthe GLB Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, \nas amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 \n(CCPA), the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR), the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018 and U.K. \nGDPR, the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act, the Japanese \nPersonal \nInformation \nProtection \nAct, \nthe \nPersonal \nInformation Protection Law of the People’s Republic of \nChina, the Australian Privacy Act 1988, and India’s Digital \nPersonal Data Protection Act. Generally, privacy laws impose \nobligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure \nof personal information and require public disclosure of \nprivacy practices. Some privacy laws offer individuals certain \nrights about how their personal information is processed, \nprovide for significant penalties for non-compliance, and, \nunder certain circumstances, impose requirements for \ntransfers of personal data across national borders.  \nIn 2023, the SEC proposed to amend Regulation Systems \nCompliance and Integrity (SCI). The proposed amendments \nto Regulation SCI would, among other things, expand the \ntypes of entities covered by the regulation, require additional \npolicies and procedures to address cybersecurity risks, and \nrequire disclosure of additional types of cybersecurity events \nto the SEC. \nIn 2024, the SEC amended Regulation S-P that implements \nthe GLB Act. The amendments to Regulation S-P require \nbroker-dealers, \ninvestment \ncompanies \nand \ninvestment \nadvisers registered with the SEC to adopt written policies and \nprocedures for incident response programs to address \nunauthorized access to or use of customer information. The \namended Regulation S-P requires covered entities to notify \nwithin 30 days individuals affected by an incident involving \nsensitive customer information and provide them with details \nabout the incident and other information intended to help \naffected individuals respond appropriately. Larger covered \nentities, such as GS&Co., will have until December 2025, and \nsmaller covered entities will have until June 2026, to comply \nwith the amended Regulation S-P. In 2024, the California \nPrivacy Protection Agency proposed regulations under the \nCCPA relating to cybersecurity audits, risk assessments, and \nautomated decision-making technology.\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations \ngoverning cybersecurity and related risks, and which require \nregulatory disclosures, and, in some instances, individual \ndisclosures, of certain security incidents. These include, but \nare not limited to, the NYDFS Cybersecurity Requirements \nfor Financial Services Companies. The NYDFS also requires \nfinancial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS \nBank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain \na \ncybersecurity \nprogram \ndesigned \nto \nensure \nthe \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of their information \nsystems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cybersecurity \npolicy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection \nof their information systems and nonpublic information; and \n(iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. In 2023, \nthe NYDFS adopted amendments to its cybersecurity \nregulations that will impose heightened or additional \nrequirements \nwith \nrespect \nto \ncybersecurity \nincident \nnotifications, risk management and governance. Most of \nthese amendments became effective in 2024 although certain \namendments have a longer transition period and become \neffective in 2025.\nIn 2023, the E.U. Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) \nbecame effective and applies from January 2025. DORA \nrequires E.U. financial entities, such as GSBE, to have a \ncomprehensive governance and control framework for the \nmanagement of information and communications technology \nrisk. In addition, in 2024, the E.U. Artificial Intelligence Act \n(E.U. AI Act) became effective. Certain provisions of the E.U. \nAI Act apply from February 2025, with other provisions \napplying between August 2025 and August 2027. The E.U. AI \nAct establishes rules for placing on the market, putting into \nservice, and using artificial intelligence systems in the E.U.\nIn 2024, the CFPB adopted a rule regarding personal financial \ndata rights that requires financial institutions that offer \nconsumer deposit accounts and issue credit cards, such as GS \nBank USA, to provide consumers electronic access to at least \n24 months of transaction data and certain account \ninformation and are prohibited from imposing any fees or \ncharges for maintaining or providing access to such data. The \nrule also imposes data accuracy, retention and other \nobligations, and data use limitations and other obligations on \nentities obtaining access to such personal financial data, such \nas GS&Co. The current compliance deadline for large \nfinancial institutions, including GS Bank USA, is April 1, \n2026. However, this timeline is potentially subject to change \nas a result of CFPB action or currently pending litigation. \nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition and Results of Operations — Risk Management \n— Cybersecurity Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this \nForm 10-K for further information about our cybersecurity \nrisk management, strategy and governance.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n25\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\nPolicymakers, lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and \nother jurisdictions have recently increased their focus on \nESG-related risk oversight, disclosure, and practices at \nfinancial institutions and other companies. \nIn 2023, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued \nprinciples for climate-related financial risk management for \nlarge financial institutions, which apply to regulated financial \ninstitutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated \nassets, including us. The principles are intended to support \nefforts by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects \nof climate-related financial risk management and consist of \nsix \ngeneral \nprinciples: \n(1) \ngovernance; \n(2) \npolicies, \nprocedures, and limits; (3) strategic planning; (4) risk \nmanagement; (5) data, risk measurement, and reporting; and \n(6) scenario analysis. In 2023, the SEC adopted amendments \nto Rule 35d-1 (Names Rule) under the Investment Company \nAct of 1940. The previous Names Rule generally required a \nfund with a name suggesting a focus in a particular type of \ninvestment, or in investments in a particular industry or \ngeographic region, to adopt a policy to invest at least 80% of \nthe value of its assets in the type of investment, or in \ninvestments in the industry, country or geographic region, \nsuggested by its name. The amendments expand such 80% \ninvestment policy to apply to any fund name with terms \nsuggesting that the fund focuses in investments that have, or \ninvestments whose issuers have, particular characteristics, \nincluding names that suggest the fund incorporates ESG \nfactors in its investment decisions. In 2022, the SEC proposed \na rule that would require enhanced disclosures by certain \ninvestment advisers and investment companies about their \nESG investment practices. \nIn 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to \nprovide certain climate-related disclosures, including Scope 1 \nand Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions to the extent they are \nmaterial. These rules require certain disclosures related to \nsevere weather events and other natural conditions in the \nnotes to audited financial statements. These disclosures are \nrequired to be phased-in over multiple years beginning with \nfiscal year 2025 for large accelerated filers like us. However, \nthe SEC has stayed the implementation of these rules, \npending the outcome of litigation challenging the rules.\nSeveral states in which we operate have enacted or proposed \nstatutes, regulations or guidance addressing climate change \nand other ESG issues, including climate disclosure laws and \nclimate-related financial risk management guidance. For \nexample, in 2023, the NYDFS issued guidance on climate-\nrelated financial risk management applicable to NYDFS-\nregulated banking and mortgage organizations, including GS \nBank USA. The guidance addresses material financial risks \nrelated to climate change faced by these organizations in the \ncontext of risk assessment, risk management, and risk \nappetite setting.\nCertain states have also enacted, or are considering enacting, \n“fair access” statutes that generally prohibit financial \ninstitutions from denying or canceling services on the basis of \nfactors, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, “social \ncredit scores,” or any factor that is not quantitative, \nimpartial, and risk-based.\nCertain of our entities are expected to be subject, in varying \ndegrees, to sustainability-related laws being implemented \nacross certain jurisdictions, including by E.U. member states. \nE.U. rules include directives, such as the Corporate \nSustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Corporate \nSustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), both of \nwhich would, if implemented in current form, significantly \nexpand the scope of ESG disclosure requirements applicable \nto us. There remains uncertainty around timing, scope and \nimpacts to us, as numerous member states have not yet \ntransposed some of these directives into national law, and the \nEuropean Commission stated its intention to revisit these \ndirectives, among potentially others, with a desire to pursue \nan Omnibus package, which could impact us. Our regulated \nbanking subsidiaries in the E.U. are also subject to \nsupervisory expectations and potential enforcement actions \nfor, among others, the management of climate-related \nfinancial risks and related disclosure.\nThe CRR and the E.U. member states’ legislation \nimplementing CRD require large institutions with securities \ntraded on a regulated market of a member state to make \nqualitative \nand \nquantitative \ndisclosures \nrelating \nto \nenvironmental, social and governance risks on a semi-annual \nbasis. GSBE is expected to become subject to this requirement \nin January 2026.\nIn 2021, the FCA introduced mandatory Taskforce on \nClimate-related \nFinancial \nDisclosures \n(TCFD)-aligned \ndisclosure requirements for certain FCA-regulated firms, \nincluding GSI and GSAMI. These entities are also subject to \nclimate-related financial disclosures required under the U.K. \nCompanies Act. In addition, during 2024, new FCA rules on \nsustainability requirements and investment labels became \neffective. We continue to assess the impact of other ESG-\nrelated regulatory frameworks that will, or are proposed to, \nin the future apply to our FCA- and/or PRA-regulated \nsubsidiaries. Our PRA-regulated banking subsidiaries are \nalso subject to the PRA’s supervisory expectations for the \nmanagement of climate-related financial risks, including with \nrespect to governance, risk management, scenario analysis \nand disclosure. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n32\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe following are detailed descriptions of our Risk Factors \nsummarized above:\nMarket\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by conditions in the global financial \nmarkets and broader economic conditions.\nMany of our businesses, by their nature, do not produce \npredictable earnings, and all of our businesses are materially \naffected by conditions in the global financial markets and \neconomic conditions generally, both directly and through \ntheir impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness. \nThese conditions can change suddenly and negatively. \nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the \nenvironment in which our businesses operate. A favorable \nbusiness environment is generally characterized by, among \nother factors, high global gross domestic product growth, \nregulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, \nliquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, \nconsumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical \nconditions and strong business earnings. \nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions \ncan be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic \ngrowth, business activity or investor, business or consumer \nconfidence; concerns over a potential recession; changes in \nconsumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; \nlimitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit \nand capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest \nrates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or \ndefault rates; high levels of inflation or stagflation; concerns \nabout U.S. and other sovereign defaults; uncertainty \nconcerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, \ndebt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about \npotential changes in tax rates and regulatory changes; \nlimitations on international trade and travel; changes in \nimmigration policies; laws and regulations that limit trading \nin, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their \ndomestic markets; outbreaks or worsening of domestic or \ninternational tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear \nproliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other \nforms \nof \ndisruption \nto \nor \ncurtailment \nof \nglobal \ncommunication, energy transmission or transportation \nnetworks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; \ncorporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor \nconfidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or \nother natural disasters; or a combination of these or other \nfactors.\nThe financial services industry and the securities and other \nfinancial markets have been materially and adversely affected \nin the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all \nasset classes, by a severe lack of liquidity and by high levels of \nborrower defaults. In addition, concerns about actual or \npotential increases in interest rates, inflation and other \nborrowing costs, a public health emergency, sovereign debt \nrisk and its impact on the relevant sovereign banking system, \nand limitations on international trade, have, at times, \nnegatively impacted the levels of client activity.\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market \nactivities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory \nreform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO \nconfidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has \nin the past negatively impacted client activity, which has in \nthe past adversely affected and could in the future adversely \naffect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and \nperiods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity \nhave at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-\nmaking businesses.\nChanges, or proposed changes, to U.S. international trade \nand investment policies, particularly with important trading \npartners, have in recent years negatively impacted financial \nmarkets. Continued or escalating tensions may result in \nfurther actions taken by the U.S. or other countries that could \ndisrupt international trade and investment and adversely \naffect financial markets. Those actions could include, among \nothers, the implementation of or increase in sanctions, tariffs \nor foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. \nTreasury securities or other restrictions on cross-border \ntrade, investment, or transfer of information or technology. \nSuch developments have in the past affected and could in the \nfuture adversely affect our or our clients’ businesses.\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by \nincreased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived \ngovernment support of such institutions in the event of future \nfinancial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in \nwhich governmental support is maintained. In addition, \nliquidity in the financial markets has in the past been, and \ncould in the future be, negatively impacted as market \nparticipants and market practices and structures adjust to \nevolving regulatory frameworks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n33\nIn 2023, the U.S. federal government suspended the federal \ndebt limit until 2025. If Congress does not raise the debt \nceiling, the U.S. could default on its obligations, including \nTreasury securities that play an integral role in financial \nmarkets. A default by the U.S. could result in unprecedented \nmarket volatility and illiquidity, heightened operational risks \nrelating to the clearance and settlement of transactions, \nmargin and other disputes with clients and counterparties, an \nadverse impact to investors including money market funds \nthat invest in U.S. Treasuries, downgrades in the U.S. credit \nrating, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs \nand a recession in the U.S. or other economies. Continued \nuncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in \ndowngrades of the U.S. credit rating, which could adversely \naffect market conditions, lead to margin disputes, increases in \ninterest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant \noperational changes among market participants, including us. \nA downgrade of the U.S. federal government’s credit rating \ncould also materially and adversely affect the market for \nrepurchase agreements, securities borrowing and lending, and \nother financings typically collateralized by U.S. Treasury or \nagency obligations. Further, the fair value, liquidity and \ncredit ratings of securities issued by, or other obligations of, \nagencies of the U.S. government or related to the U.S. \ngovernment or its agencies, as well as municipal bonds could \nbe similarly adversely affected. An increasing frequency of \ngovernment shutdowns, or near shutdowns, in the U.S. could \nalso lead to uncertainty as to the continued funding of the \nU.S. government, which could, in turn, adversely affect the \ncredit ratings of the U.S. and the market for U.S. Treasury or \nagency obligations.\nIn 2024, numerous elections were held globally, including the \nrecent U.S. presidential election. The outcomes of the \nelections are expected to result in changes in policy, which \ncould also have adverse effects on us or the business \nenvironment in which we operate more generally. For \nexample, the new U.S. presidential administration has \nimposed or increased tariffs, including on imports from \nChina, and proposed imposing or increasing tariffs on U.S. \ntrading partners, which could adversely affect markets, the \nbusiness environment and some of our businesses.\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely \naffected \nby \ndeclining \nasset \nvalues, \nparticularly where we have net “long” positions, \nreceive fees based on the value of assets managed, or \nreceive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net “long” positions in debt \nsecurities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including \nprivate equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. \nThese include positions we take when we act as a principal to \nfacilitate our clients’ activities, including our exchange-based \nmarket-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital \nto maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as \nwell as through our currencies, commodities, equities and \nmortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar \nasset classes. Substantially all of our investing and market-\nmaking positions and a portion of our loans are marked-to-\nmarket on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset \nvalues directly and promptly impact our earnings, unless we \nhave effectively “hedged” our exposures to those declines. \nIn certain circumstances, it may not be possible or economic \nto hedge our exposures and, to the extent that we do so, the \nhedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to \nprofit from increases in the values of the assets. This is \nparticularly the case for credit products, including leveraged \nloans, and private equities or other securities that are not \nfreely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets. \nSudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of \nassets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, \nand may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the \ntrading markets for certain assets, which may make it \ndifficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. We may incur \nlosses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or \ncease \nto \nfunction, \nincluding \nwith \nrespect \nto \nloan \ncommitments we have made or securities offerings we have \nunderwritten. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets \nreduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the \ndifficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected, \nand may in the future negatively affect, our capital, liquidity \nor leverage ratios, our funding costs and our ability to deploy \ncapital.\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are \nobligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly \nmarket, including by purchasing securities in a declining \nmarket. In markets where asset values are declining and in \nvolatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need \nfor liquidity.\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value \nof our clients’ portfolios or investment in funds managed by \nus and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on \nincreases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset \nvalues would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients’ \nportfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically \nreduce the fees we earn for managing such assets. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n34\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive \ncollateral that supports the obligations of our clients and \ncounterparties. When the value of the assets posted as \ncollateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral \ndecline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide \nadditional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading \nposition. An example of such a situation is a “margin call” in \nconnection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in \nthe value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either \nthe cost of funding positions is increased or the size of \npositions is decreased. If we are the party providing \ncollateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our \nprofitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this \ncan also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of \nbusiness done with our clients and counterparties.\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the \ndifficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and time-\nconsuming disputes over asset values and the level of required \ncollateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of \nthe collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In \ncases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the \nvalue or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in, \nand may in the future result in, significant losses to us, \nespecially where there is a single type of collateral supporting \nthe obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the \nfuture be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not \npermitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an \nimproper manner, including in violation of law, or caused a \nclient or counterparty to incur significant losses or go out of \nbusiness.\nOur market-making activities have been and may in \nthe future be affected by changes in the levels of \nmarket volatility.\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market \nvolatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to \nour clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may \nin the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client \nactivity associated with them and have adversely affected and \nmay in the future adversely affect the results of these \nactivities. While increased volatility can increase trading \nvolumes and spreads, it also increases risk as measured by \nValue-at-Risk (VaR) and increases risks in connection with \nour market-making activities and can cause us to reduce our \ninventory. Limiting the size of our market-making positions \ncan adversely affect our profitability. In periods when \nvolatility is increasing, but asset values are declining \nsignificantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it \nmay only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those \ncircumstances, we have been and may in the future be forced \nto either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to \ndecrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase \nthe level of our RWAs, which increases the amount of capital \nthat we are required to hold, and this can reduce our \nprofitability and reduce our ability to distribute capital to our \nshareholders. For example, in August 2024, market volatility \nincreased significantly, which adversely affected activity \nlevels, increased our market RWAs and adversely impacted \nour results on some days.\nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset \nmanagement and wealth management businesses \nhave been adversely affected and may in the future be \nadversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of \nconfidence among investors and CEOs due to \ndeclines in economic activity and other unfavorable \neconomic, geopolitical or market conditions.\nOur investment banking business has been and may in the \nfuture be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor \neconomic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical \nconditions may adversely affect and have in the past \nadversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in \nsignificant industry-wide declines in the size and number of \nunderwritings and of advisory transactions, which would \nlikely have, and have in the past had, an adverse effect on our \nrevenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a \nsignificant portion of our investment banking revenues is \nderived from our participation in large transactions, a decline \nin the number of large transactions has in the past and would \nin the future adversely affect our investment banking \nbusiness. Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public \nofferings and other securities offerings have accounted for a \nsignificant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative, \nregulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or the \nissuance of, securities outside the issuers’ domestic markets, \nthat result in or could result in the delisting or removal of \nsecurities from exchanges or indices, have in the past \nadversely affected and would in the future adversely affect \nour underwriting and client intermediation businesses. \nFurthermore, changes, or proposed changes, to international \ntrade and investment policies of the U.S. and other countries \ncould negatively affect market activity levels and our \nrevenues.\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general \ndeclines in market or economic activity may adversely affect \nour client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of \noverall activity or by decreasing volatility.\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic \nconditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our \nclients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other \nproducts or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced \nnet revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth \nmanagement businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their \nfunds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee \nincome.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n35\nOur asset management and wealth management \nbusinesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely \naffected \nby \nthe \npoor \ninvestment \nperformance of our investment products or a client \npreference for products other than those which we \noffer or for products that generate lower fees.\nPoor investment returns in our asset management and wealth \nmanagement businesses, due to either general market \nconditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors \nor to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or \ninvestment products that we design or sell, affect our ability \nto retain existing assets and to attract new clients or \nadditional assets from existing clients. This could affect the \nmanagement and incentive fees that we earn on assets under \nsupervision (AUS) or the commissions and net spreads that \nwe earn for selling other investment products. To the extent \nthat our clients choose to invest in products that we do not \ncurrently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of \nmanagement fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor \nsentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes \nor otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that \ngenerate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income \nproducts), our average effective management fee will decline \nfurther and our asset management and wealth management \nbusinesses could be adversely affected.\nInflation has had, and could continue to have, a \nnegative effect on our business, results of operations \nand financial condition.\nInflationary pressures in recent years have affected \neconomies, financial markets and market participants \nworldwide. Inflationary pressures in recent years have \nincreased certain of our operating expenses, and have \nadversely affected consumer sentiment and CEO confidence. \nCentral bank responses to inflationary pressures in recent \nyears have also resulted in higher market interest rates, \nwhich, in turn, have contributed to lower activity levels \nacross financial markets, in particular for debt underwriting \ntransactions and mortgage originations, and resulted in lower \nvalues for certain financial assets which have adversely \naffected our equity and debt investments. Higher interest \nrates increase our borrowing costs and have in recent years \nrequired us to increase interest paid on our deposits. If \ninflationary pressures increase, our expenses may increase; \nwe may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target; \nactivity levels for certain of our businesses, in particular debt \nunderwriting and mortgages, may decline; our interest \nexpense could increase faster than our interest income, \nreducing our net interest income and net interest margin; \ncertain of our investments could incur losses or generally low \nlevels of returns; AUS could decline, or the composition of \nour AUS could shift to lower fee products, reducing \nmanagement and other fees; economies worldwide could \nexperience recessions; and we could continue to operate in a \ngenerally unfavorable economic and market environment.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may be \nadversely affected by an inability to access the debt \ncapital markets or to sell assets.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical \nimportance to us, as most of the failures of financial \ninstitutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient \nliquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to \naccess secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to \nraise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds from our \nsubsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an \ninability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of \ntimely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, \nor other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This \nsituation may arise due to circumstances that we may be \nunable to control, such as a general market or economic \ndisruption or an operational problem that affects third \nparties or us, or even by the perception among market \nparticipants that we, or other market participants, are \nexperiencing greater liquidity risk.\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and \nhedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold \nand the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, \nand these complex structured products often do not have \nreadily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. \nOur investing and financing activities may lead to situations \nwhere the holdings from these activities represent a \nsignificant portion of specific markets, which could restrict \nliquidity for our positions. \nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is \nnot generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in \ncircumstances where other market participants are seeking to \nsell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, \nas is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in \nresponse to changes to rules or regulations. For example, in \n2021, an investment management firm with large positions \nwith several financial institutions defaulted, resulting in \nrapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those \npositions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges and other \nfinancial institutions with which we interact may exercise set-\noff rights or the right to require additional collateral, \nincluding in difficult market conditions, which could further \nimpair our liquidity.\nNumerous \nregulations \nimpose \nstringent \nliquidity \nrequirements on large financial institutions, including us. \nThese regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly \nliquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy \nfunding. In addition, our need to manage our operations in \nlight of certain regulatory requirements when applicable \nthresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the \nfuture limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other \nfunding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability \nto respond efficiently to liquidity stress.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n36\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in \nthe credit markets, including reduced access to credit \nand higher costs of obtaining credit.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the \navailability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our \nability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may \ndo so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis \nby primarily issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, \nby raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid \nfinancial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit \nfrom commercial or other banking entities. We seek to \nfinance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any \ndisruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and \nmore expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our \navailable funding is limited or we are forced to fund our \noperations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us \nto curtail our business activities and increase our cost of \nfunding, both of which could reduce our profitability, \nparticularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending \nand market making.\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types \nof strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured \nand unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A \nlack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can \nadversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients’ \nmergers and acquisitions transactions, particularly large \ntransactions, and adversely affect our advisory and \nunderwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be \nnegatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A \nlack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price \nvolatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of \nwhich can increase transaction risk or decrease the \nprofitability of these businesses.\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our \ncredit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and \ncost of funding.\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction \nin our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and \ncompetitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our \naccess to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under \ncertain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized \nfinancing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties \ncould be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require \nus to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading \nand collateralized financing contracts could cause us to \nsustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find \nother sources of financing or to make significant cash \npayments or securities movements. \nAs of December 2024, our counterparties could have called \nfor additional collateral or termination payments related to \nour net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an \naggregate amount of $315 million in the event of a one-notch \ndowngrade of our credit ratings and $1.20 billion in the event \nof a two-notch downgrade of our credit ratings. A \ndowngrade by any one rating agency, depending on the \nagency’s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, \nmay have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a \ndowngrade by all rating agencies. For further information \nabout our credit ratings, see “Management’s Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — \nRisk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Credit \nRatings” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly \nrelated to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the \ninterest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). \nIncreases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our \ncost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are \ncontinuous, market-driven, and subject at times to \nunpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit \nspreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our \ncreditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of \ncredit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The \nmarket for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely \nvolatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency \nor liquidity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n37\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity \ndepends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries, \nmany of which are subject to legal, regulatory and \nother restrictions on providing funds or assets to \nGroup Inc.\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on \ndividends, distributions, loans and other payments from its \nsubsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments \nand to fund payments on its obligations, including debt \nobligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-\ndealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict \ndividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or \nreduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group \nInc. \nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank entities and their \nsubsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend \nor transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital \nand other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability \nto use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank \naccounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on \nrelated-party transactions, increased capital and liquidity \nrequirements and additional limitations on the use of funds \non deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower \nearnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet \nthe obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB’s \nsource of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. \nto provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. \nRestrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede \naccess to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on \nits obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend \npayments. In addition, Group Inc.’s right to participate in a \ndistribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or \nreorganization is subject to the prior claims of the \nsubsidiary’s creditors.\nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and \nsupervision of our branches and subsidiaries by the \ngovernments and regulators in the countries in which those \nbranches and subsidiaries are located or do business. \nConcerns about protecting clients and creditors of branches \nand subsidiaries of financial institutions that are located \noutside of the country in which such branches or subsidiaries \nare located or do business have caused or may cause a \nnumber of governments and regulators to take additional \nsteps to “ring fence” or require internal total loss-absorbing \ncapacity (which may also be subject to “bail-in” powers, as \ndescribed below) at those branches and subsidiaries in order \nto protect clients and creditors of those branches and \nsubsidiaries in the event of financial difficulties involving \nthose branches and subsidiaries. The result has been and may \ncontinue to be additional limitations on our ability to \nefficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated \nentities, or to Group Inc., including in times of stress, thereby \nincreasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required \nby us on a consolidated basis.\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment \nobligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. \nand GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, \nGroup Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other \nconsolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction \nbasis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees \nmay require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets \nto its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a \ntime when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own \nobligations. \nThe requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to \ndevelop and submit recovery and resolution plans to \nregulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from \nregulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity \nlevels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or \nparticular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or \nduplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and \nmay reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of \nthe obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. \nResolution planning may also impair our ability to structure \nour intercompany and external activities in a manner that we \nmay \notherwise \ndeem \nmost \noperationally \nefficient. \nFurthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution \nplanning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any \nsuch limitations or requirements would be in addition to the \nlegal and regulatory restrictions described above on our \nability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany \ndividends or payments. \nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form \n10-K for further information about regulatory restrictions.\nCredit\nOur businesses, profitability and liquidity may be \nadversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality \nof or defaults by third parties.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us \nmoney, securities or other assets will not perform their \nobligations. These parties may default on their obligations to \nus due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or \nother reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or \neven concerns about a default by such an institution, has in \nthe past and could in the future lead to significant liquidity \nproblems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in \nturn could adversely affect us. We are also exposed to the risk \nof a special assessment, including under the FDIA or OLA in \nthe event of the failure of a bank or non-bank financial \ninstitution, which have in the past, and may in the future, \nadversely affect our results of operations.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n38\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third \nparties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In \naddition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties \nwhose securities or obligations we hold, including a \ndeterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties \nto secure their obligations to us, including under derivative \ncontracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or \nadversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use \nthose securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. \nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our \ncounterparties could also have a negative impact on our \nresults. While in many cases we are permitted to require \nadditional collateral from counterparties that experience \nfinancial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of \ncollateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged \nassets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on \ncollateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise \nof our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with \ncounterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically \nincrease significantly in times of market stress, increased \nvolatility and illiquidity. \nAs part of our clearing and prime financing activities, we \nfinance our clients’ positions, and we could be held \nresponsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. \nDefault risk may arise from events or circumstances that are \ndifficult to detect or foresee.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for \nsignificant losses in our market-making, underwriting, \ninvesting and financing activities.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant \nlosses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and \nfinancing activities. The number and size of these \ntransactions has affected and may in the future affect our \nresults of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of \nconcentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic \nand market conditions are generally favorable for our \ncompetitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it \ndifficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or \neconomically. In addition, we extend large commitments as \npart of our credit origination activities. Disruptions in the \ncredit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or \neliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or \neliminate, the trading markets for loans we originate. These \ndisruptions have in the past made, and may in the future \nmake, it difficult for us to sell or value such assets, which \nhave in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in \nlosses for us.\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules \nadopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain asset-\nbacked securities and any person who organizes and initiates \ncertain \nasset-backed \nsecurities \ntransactions \nto \nretain \neconomic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of \nand structures used in connection with these securitization \nactivities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, \nsyndicating or securitizing these positions, including during \nperiods of market stress, has in the past negatively affected \nand may in the future negatively affect our results of \noperations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, \nincluding due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, \nas well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such \nsecurities or loans.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to \na concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, \nborrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic \narea or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a \nfailure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could \nnegatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the \nsystems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our \ncredit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries \nand regions may not function as we have anticipated. \nRegulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to \nincreased centralization of trading activity through particular \nclearinghouses, agent banks or exchanges, which has \nsignificantly increased our concentration of risk with respect \nto these entities. While our activities expose us to many \ndifferent industries, counterparties and countries, we \nroutinely execute a high volume of transactions with \ncounterparties engaged in financial services activities, \nincluding \nbrokers \nand \ndealers, \ncommercial \nbanks, \nclearinghouses, exchanges and investment funds. This has \nresulted in significant credit concentration with respect to \nthese counterparties. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n39\nDerivative transactions and delayed documentation or \nsettlements expose us to credit risk, unexpected risks \nand potential losses.\nWe are party to a large number of derivative transactions, \nincluding credit derivatives. Many of these derivative \ninstruments \nare \nindividually \nnegotiated \nand \nnon-\nstandardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling \npositions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we \ndeliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or \nother obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of \ncases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other \nobligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying \nsecurity, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to \nforfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result \nin settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational \nrisk, as well as increased costs to us. \nDerivative \ntransactions \nalso \ninvolve \nthe \nrisk \nthat \ndocumentation has not been properly executed, that executed \nagreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, \nor that obligations under such agreements may not be able to \nbe “netted” against other obligations with such counterparty. \nIn addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions \nwere not appropriate or authorized.\nAs a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA \nProtocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB’s and \nFDIC’s rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, \nwe may not be able to exercise remedies against \ncounterparties and, as this regime has not yet been tested, we \nmay suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to \nsuffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a \ntermination event. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and \nregulations extend to repurchase agreements and other \ninstruments that are not derivative contracts.\nDerivative contracts and other transactions, including \nsecondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with \nthird parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties \nor settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains \nunconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject \nto heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a \ndefault may find it more difficult to enforce our rights.\nIn addition, as new complex derivative products are created, \ncovering a wider array of underlying credit and other \ninstruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying \ncontracts could arise, which could impair our ability to \neffectively manage our risk exposures from these products \nand subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the \nDodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit \nderivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift \ntoward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk \nassociated with these transactions, but under certain \ncircumstances could also limit our ability to develop \nderivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge \nour own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability. In \naddition, these provisions have increased our credit exposure \nto central clearing platforms. \nOperational\nA failure in our or third-party operational systems or \nhuman error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could \nimpair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in \nthe disclosure of confidential information, damage our \nreputation and cause losses.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process \nand monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of \ntransactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at \nhigh volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse \nmarkets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as \nthe information technology services we provide to clients, \noften must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal \nand regulatory standards. \nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern our \nobligations to execute transactions and report transactions \nand other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. \nCompliance with these legal and reporting requirements can \nbe challenging, and we have been and may in the future be \nsubject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow \nthese rules or to report timely, accurate and complete \ninformation in accordance with these rules. \nAs the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of \ntransactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the \nrequirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis \nto clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing and \nmaintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has \nbecome more challenging, and the risk of systems or human \nerror by us or our third-party service providers in connection \nwith such transactions has increased, as have the potential \nconsequences of errors due to the speed and volume of \ntransactions involved and the potential difficulty associated \nwith discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting \nconsequences. For example, the transition to a T+1 \nsettlement timeframe in the U.S. in 2024 has subjected us to, \nand will continue to subject us to, increased operational risks \nwith respect to reporting and timely settlement of \ntransactions. These risks are exacerbated in times of \nincreased volatility. As with other similarly situated \ninstitutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in \nconnection with our businesses, including our consumer-\noriented activities. Allegations or publicity, whether or not \naccurate, that our underwriting decisions do not treat \nconsumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law \nor regulation, have in the past resulted and may in the future \nresult in negative publicity, reputational damage and \ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny, investigations and \nenforcement actions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n40\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nOur financial, accounting, data processing or other \noperational systems and facilities have in the past not \noperated properly in certain respects and may in the future \nnot operate properly or become disabled as a result of events \nthat are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a \nspike in transaction volume or an operational disruption at a \nthird-party service provider, adversely affecting our ability to \nprocess these transactions or provide these services. We must \ncontinuously update our systems to support our operations \nand growth and to respond to changes in regulations and \nmarkets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training \nto pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do \nnot violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors \nin processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our \nclients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates \nto systems, as well as the requisite training, including in \nconnection with the integration of new businesses, entail \nsignificant \ncosts \nand \ncreate \nrisks \nassociated \nwith \nimplementing new systems and integrating them with \nexisting ones. \nThe use of computing devices, phones and other mobile \ndevices is critical to the work done by our employees and the \noperation of our systems and businesses and those of our \nclients and our third-party service providers and vendors. \nTheir importance has continued to increase, for both our \nregular operations and business continuity plans. Computers \nand computer networks are subject to various risks, \nincluding, \namong \nothers, \ncyber \nattacks, \ninherent \ntechnological defects, system disruptions and failures and \nhuman error. For example, fundamental security flaws in \ncomputer chips found in many types of these computing \ndevices and phones have been reported in the past and may \noccur in the future, and in July 2024 there was a widely \npublicized information technology outage as a result of a \nfaulty update to a cybersecurity software product that \naffected many businesses worldwide. The use of personal \ndevices by our employees or by our vendors for work-related \nactivities also presents risks related to potential violations of \nrecord retention and other requirements. Cloud technologies \nare also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms \nand our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service \ndisruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in \ndelays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to \nour businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our \nplatforms. There have been a number of widely publicized \ncases of outages in connection with access to cloud \ncomputing providers. Addressing these and similar issues \ncould be costly and affect the performance of these businesses \nand systems. Applying fixes can introduce operational risks, \nand, despite the fixes, there may still be residual security \nrisks. \nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and \ntechnology-based risk and control systems, our businesses \nultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from \ntime to time, they have in the past and may in the future \nmake mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, \nlaws, rules or procedures that are not always caught \nimmediately by our technological processes or by our \ncontrols and other procedures, which are intended to prevent \nand detect such errors or violations. These have in the past \nand may in the future include calculation errors, mistakes in \naddressing emails, errors in software or model development \nor implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as \nintentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, \nlaws, rules or procedures. Human errors, malfeasance and \nother misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client \ninformation in connection with insider trading or for other \npurposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, has in \nthe past resulted and may in the future result in reputational \ndamage and losses and liabilities for us.\nThe majority of the employees in our primary locations, \nincluding the New York metropolitan area, London, \nBengaluru, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Salt Lake City, \nDallas, Singapore, Warsaw and Birmingham, work in close \nproximity to one another. Our headquarters is located in the \nNew York metropolitan area, and we have our largest \nemployee concentration occupying two principal office \nbuildings near the Hudson River waterfront. They are subject \nto potential catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, \nterrorist attacks, extreme weather, or other hostile events \nthat could negatively affect our business. Notwithstanding \nour efforts to maintain business continuity, business \ndisruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead \nto our employees’ inability to occupy the offices, \ncommunicate with or travel to other office locations or work \nremotely. As a result, our ability to service and interact with \nclients may be adversely impacted, due to our failure or \ninability to successfully implement business contingency \nplans.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Industry consolidation, whether \namong market participants or financial intermediaries, \nincreases the risk of operational failure or significant \noperational delay as disparate complex systems need to be \nintegrated, often on an accelerated basis.\nThe interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with \nagent banks, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased \ncentrality of these entities, increases the risk that an \noperational failure at one institution or entity may cause an \nindustry-wide operational failure that could materially \nimpact our ability to conduct business. Interconnectivity of \nfinancial institutions with other companies through, among \nother things, application programming interfaces or APIs \npresents similar risks. Any such failure, termination or \nconstraint could adversely affect our ability to effect \ntransactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk \nor expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability \nto our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our \nbusinesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. \nDespite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to \nconduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption \nin the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the \ncommunities where we are located. This may include a \ndisruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or \nother communications, internet, transportation or other \nfacilities used by us, our employees or third parties with \nwhich we conduct business, including cloud service \nproviders. These disruptions may occur as a result of events \nthat affect only our buildings or systems or those of third \nparties, or as a result of events with a broader impact \nglobally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or \nsystems are located, including, but not limited to, natural \ndisasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, economic or political \ndevelopments, pandemics and weather events. \nIn addition, although we seek to diversify our third-party \nvendors to increase our resiliency, we are exposed to risks if \nour vendors operate in the same area and are also exposed to \nthe risk that a disruption or other information technology \nevent at a common service provider to our vendors could \nimpede their ability to provide products or services to us. We \nmay not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational \nrisks relating to our vendors’ use of common service \nproviders.\nAdditionally, although the prevalence and scope of \napplications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency \nand similar technologies is growing, the technology is nascent \nand may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other \ninherent weaknesses. We are exposed to risks, and may \nbecome exposed to additional risks, related to distributed \nledger technology, including through our facilitation of \nclients’ activities involving financial products that use \ndistributed \nledger \ntechnology, \nsuch \nas \nblockchain, \ncryptocurrencies or other digital assets, our investments in \ncompanies that seek to develop platforms based on \ndistributed ledger technology, the use of distributed ledger \ntechnology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, \nclearinghouses and other financial intermediaries, and the \nreceipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as \ncollateral. Market volatility of financial products using \ndistributed ledger technology may increase these risks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n42\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe development and use of AI present risks and \nchallenges that may adversely impact our business.\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have \nin the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future \ndevelop or incorporate, AI technology in certain business \nprocesses, services or products. The development and use of \nAI present a number of risks and challenges to our business. \nThe legal and regulatory environment relating to AI is \nuncertain and rapidly evolving, both in the U.S. and \ninternationally, and includes regulation targeted specifically \nat AI as well as provisions in intellectual property, privacy, \nconsumer protection, employment and other laws applicable \nto the use of AI. These evolving laws and regulations could \nrequire changes in our implementation of AI technology and \nincrease our compliance costs and the risk of non-\ncompliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, \nmay produce output or take action that is incorrect, that \nresult in the release of private, confidential or proprietary \ninformation, that reflect biases included in the data on which \nthey are trained, infringe on the intellectual property rights of \nothers, or that is otherwise harmful. In addition, the \ncomplexity of many AI models makes it challenging to \nunderstand why they are generating particular outputs. This \nlimited transparency increases the challenges associated with \nassessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding \nand monitoring the capabilities of the AI models, reducing \nerroneous output, eliminating bias and complying with \nregulations that require documentation or explanation of the \nbasis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on \nAI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, \nwould be dependent in part on the manner in which those \nthird parties develop and train their models, including risks \narising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the \ntraining data for their models, and the effectiveness of the \nsteps these third parties have taken to limit the risks \nassociated with the output of their models, matters over \nwhich we may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are \nexposed to risks related to the use of AI technologies by \nthird-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearinghouses \nand other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could \nexpose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory \nconsequences and harm our reputation and the public \nperception of our business or the effectiveness of our security \nmeasures.\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to \nrisks arising from the use of AI technologies by bad actors to \ncommit fraud and misappropriate funds and to facilitate \ncyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or \nlaunch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows \nor other adverse effects at a particular financial institution or \nexchange.\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks \nand information, and our clients’ information, against \ncyber attacks and similar threats could impair our \nability to conduct our businesses, result in the \ndisclosure, \ntheft \nor \ndestruction \nof \nconfidential \ninformation, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and \ntransmission of confidential and other information in our \ncomputer systems and networks and those of our vendors. \nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases \ninvolving financial services companies, consumer-based \ncompanies, software and information technology service \nproviders, governmental agencies and other organizations \nreporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client, \ncustomer or other confidential information in recent years, as \nwell as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and \ndestruction of corporate information or other assets, as a \nresult of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow \nprocedures by employees or contractors or as a result of \nactions by third parties, including actions by foreign \ngovernments. There have also been a number of highly \npublicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” \npayments \nin \nexchange \nfor \nnot \ndisclosing \ncustomer \ninformation or for restoring access to information or systems.\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, \nincluding denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously \nmonitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and \nfunctionality of our technology infrastructure and access to \nand the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of \ncyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet-\nbased products and services, as well as our usage of mobile \nand cloud technologies, and as we provide these services to \nindividual \nconsumers. \nFurther, \nthe \nuse \nof \nAI \nby \ncybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of \ncybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors \nand clients. The use of employee-owned devices presents \nadditional risks of cyber attacks, as do hybrid work \narrangements. In addition, due to our interconnectivity with \nthird-party vendors (and their respective service providers), \nagent banks, exchanges, clearinghouses and other financial \ninstitutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is \nsubject to a successful cyber attack or other information \nsecurity event. These impacts could include the loss of access \nto information or services from the third party subject to the \ncyber attack or other information security event or could \nresult in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, \ncustomer or other confidential information, which could, in \nturn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect \nour results of operations and reputation. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n43\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and \ninformation, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or \nimplement effective preventive measures against all cyber \nthreats, \nincluding \nbecause \nthe \ntechniques \nused \nare \nincreasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often \nnot recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate \nfrom a variety of sources, including third parties who are \naffiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are \ninvolved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. \nThird parties may also attempt to place individuals in our \noffices or induce employees, clients or other users of our \nsystems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to \nour data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be \ndifficult to detect or prevent. \nAlthough we take protective measures proactively and \nendeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our \ncomputer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable \nto unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other \nmalicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other \nevents that could have a security impact. Risks relating to \ncyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the \ngreater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain \nattacks affecting software and information technology service \nproviders. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of \nour systems, the process of enhancing our protective \nmeasures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and \nsecurity issues. In addition, protective measures that we \nemploy to compartmentalize our data may reduce our \nvisibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, \ncyber threats and issues with our systems.\nIf one or more of these types of events occur, it potentially \ncould jeopardize our, our clients’, our counterparties’ or third \nparties’ confidential and other information processed, stored \nin, or transmitted through our computer systems and \nnetworks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions \nin our operations or those of our clients, counterparties or \nthird parties, which could impact their ability to transact \nwith us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action, \nsignificant losses or reputational damage. In addition, such \nan event could persist for an extended period of time before \nbeing properly detected or escalated, and, following detection \nor escalation, it could take considerable time for us to obtain \nfull and reliable information about the extent, amount and \ntype of information compromised. During the course of an \ninvestigation, we may not know the full impact of the event \nand how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes \nthat are taken or made may further increase the negative \neffects of the event on our business, results of operations and \nreputation. Moreover, regulations require us to disclose \ninformation on a timely basis about material cybersecurity \nincidents, including those that may not have been resolved or \nfully investigated at the time of disclosure.\nWe have expended, and expect to continue to expend, \nsignificant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our \nprotective measures and to investigate and remediate \nvulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be \nineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory \naction, as well as financial losses that are either not insured \nagainst or not fully covered through any insurance \nmaintained by us. Regulatory agencies have become \nincreasingly focused on cybersecurity incidents.\nOur clients’ confidential information may also be at risk \nfrom the compromise of clients’ accounts, including as a \nresult of a data security breach at an unrelated company. \nLosses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our \nreputation and may have adverse effects on our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud technologies heightens \nthese and other operational risks, as do hybrid work \narrangements. Certain aspects of the security of these \ntechnologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and \nthe failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers \nto adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber \nattacks could disrupt our operations and result in \nmisappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and \nother information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption \nand other protective measures, despite their sophistication, \nmay be defeated, particularly to the extent that new \ncomputing technologies, such as quantum computing, vastly \nincrease the speed and computing power available.\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and \nproprietary information by email and other electronic means. \nWe have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service \nproviders, counterparties and other third parties to develop \nsecure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber \nattacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in \nplace, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, \nservice providers, counterparties and other third parties and \nwe may not be able to ensure that these third parties have \nappropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of \nthe information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of \npersonal, confidential or proprietary information being sent \nto or received from a client, vendor, service provider, \ncounterparty or other third party could result in legal \nliability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n44\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe have in the past incurred and may in the future \nincur losses as a result of ineffective risk management \nprocesses and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a \nrisk and control framework encompassing a variety of \nseparate but complementary financial, credit, operational, \ncompliance and legal systems, internal controls, management \nreview \nprocesses \nand \nother \nmechanisms. \nOur \nrisk \nmanagement process seeks to balance our ability to profit \nfrom market-making, investing or lending positions, and \nunderwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. \nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk \nmonitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques \nand the judgments that accompany their application cannot \nanticipate every economic and financial outcome or the \nspecifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of \nour activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur \nlosses. Market conditions in recent years have involved \nunprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations \ninherent in using historical data to manage risk.\nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk \nexposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of \ncorrelation or lack thereof among prices of various asset \nclasses or other market indicators. In times of market stress \nor other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated \nindicators may become correlated, or conversely previously \ncorrelated indicators may move in different directions. These \ntypes of market movements have at times limited the \neffectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to \nincur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. \nThese changes in correlation have been and may in the future \nbe exacerbated where other market participants are using risk \nor trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are \nsimilar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to \nreduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market \nparticipants or widespread market dislocations, including \ncircumstances where asset values are declining significantly \nor no market exists for certain assets. \nIn addition, the use of models in connection with risk \nmanagement and numerous other critical activities presents \nrisks that the models may be ineffective, either because of \npoor design, ineffective testing, or improper or flawed inputs, \nas well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in \nunapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs.\nTo the extent that we have positions through our market-\nmaking or origination activities or we make investments \ndirectly through our investing activities, including private \nequity or private credit, that do not have an established liquid \ntrading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale \nor hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and \ntherefore reduce our risk associated with those positions. In \naddition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and \nregulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, \ncredit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and \nlimitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our \ninvestments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or \nother reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control \nthe risk exposures relating to these investments. \nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, \nmay cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, \ngeographic areas or markets, which may limit our business \nopportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging \nactivities.\nOur consumer offerings present us with different risks, and \nwe have needed and continue to need to expand and adapt \nour risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for \nthese business activities. A failure to adequately assess and \ncontrol such risk exposures has in the past resulted and could \nin the future result in losses to us.\nFor further information about our risk management policies \nand procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis \nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk \nManagement” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In \nmany cases, our activities have been and may continue to be \nsubject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different \njurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of law \nenforcement authorities, regulators or private parties \nchallenging our compliance with existing laws and \nregulations, we or our employees have been, and could be, \nfined, criminally charged or sanctioned; prohibited from \nengaging in some of our business activities; subjected to \nlimitations or conditions on our business activities, including \nhigher capital requirements; or subjected to new or \nsubstantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in \nconnection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect \nto our employees. These limitations or conditions may limit \nour \nbusiness \nactivities \nand \nnegatively \nimpact \nour \nprofitability. \nIn addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our \nbusiness activities, day-to-day compliance with existing laws \nand regulations has involved and will continue to involve \nsignificant amounts of time, including that of our senior \nleaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance \nand other reporting and operational personnel, in connection \nwith which we expect to continue to add personnel, all of \nwhich may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our competitors \nhave been and will continue to be impacted by requirements \nrelating to capital, leverage, liquidity and long-term funding \nlevels, requirements related to resolution and recovery \nplanning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of \nregulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if \npermitted, how certain business activities may be carried out \nby financial institutions. The laws, regulations and \naccounting standards, that apply to our businesses are often \ncomplex and, in many cases, we must make interpretive \ndecisions regarding the application of those laws, regulations \nand accounting standards to our business activities. Changes \nin interpretations, whether in response to regulatory \nguidance, industry conventions, our own reassessments or \notherwise, could adversely affect our businesses, results of \noperations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory \nrequirements, such as capital or liquidity requirements.\nIf there are new laws or regulations or changes in the \ninterpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations \napplicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including \ncapital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-\nabsorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on \nleveraged lending or other business practices, reporting \nrequirements, \nrequirements \nrelating \nto \nrecovery \nand \nresolution \nplanning, \ntax \nburdens \nand \ncompensation \nrestrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial \ninstitutions (whether based on size, method of funding, \nactivities, geography or other criteria), compliance with these \nnew laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of \nexisting laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability \nto compete effectively with other institutions that are not \naffected in the same way. In addition, regulation imposed on \nfinancial institutions or market participants generally, such \nas taxes on stock transfers, share repurchases and other \nfinancial transactions, could adversely impact levels of \nmarket activity more broadly, and thus impact our \nbusinesses. Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, \ncould also have a disproportionate impact on us, based on \nthe way those laws or regulations are applied to financial \nservices and financial firms or due to our corporate structure \nor where or how we provide these services. Recent political \ndevelopments have added additional uncertainty with respect \nto new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretations \nor enforcement of existing laws and regulations.\nThese developments could impact our profitability in the \naffected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us to \ncontinue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those \njurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs \nassociated with changing our business practices, restructuring \nour businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and \nour employees to other locations or complying with \napplicable capital requirements, including reducing dividends \nor share repurchases, liquidating assets or raising capital in a \nmanner that adversely increases our funding costs or \notherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n46\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulatory developments, in particular the \nDodd-Frank Act and Basel III, have significantly altered the \nregulatory framework within which we operate and have \nadversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our \nprofitability. Among the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that \nhave affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: \nincreased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; \nlimitations on activities in which we may engage; increased \nregulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets \nand transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; \nlimitations on affiliate transactions; requirements to \nreorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and \nresolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; \nand increased standards of care for broker-dealers and \ninvestment \nadvisers \nin \ndealing \nwith \nclients. \nThe \nimplementation of higher capital requirements, more \nstringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt \nand total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on \nproprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, \ncovered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely \naffect our profitability and competitive position, particularly \nwhere these requirements do not apply equally to our \ncompetitors. We may become subject to higher and more \nstringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result \nof the implementation of the Basel Committee’s finalization \nof the post-crisis regulatory capital reforms as well as future \nBasel Committee standards. Substantial parts of the E.U. \nrules implementing the Basel III Revisions became effective \non January 1, 2025; the E.U. has delayed implementation of \nthe FRTB rules to January 1, 2026; the U.K. issued near final \nrules implementing the Basel III revisions with a proposed \neffective date of January 1, 2027; and the FRB has indicated \nthat it expects to work with the other U.S. federal bank \nregulatory agencies in 2025 on a revised proposal. See \n“Business — Regulation — Banking Supervision and \nRegulation — Risk-Based Capital Ratios” in Part I, Item 1 of \nthis Form 10-K for further information about proposed and \nadopted regulatory requirements.\nAs described in “Business — Regulation — Banking \nSupervision and Regulation — Risk-Based Capital Ratios” in \nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the SCB has replaced the \ncapital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital \nRules and resulted in higher and more volatile Standardized \ncapital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these \nrequirements could limit our ability to, among other things, \nrepurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain \ndiscretionary compensation payments. In addition, if we are \nrequired to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not \nmake capital distributions, such as share repurchases or \ndividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends \nand repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, \nwhich can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to \nmake capital distributions could, among other things, prevent \nus from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our \nreturn on equity. Additionally, as a G-SIB, we are subject to \nthe G-SIB surcharge. Our G-SIB surcharge is updated \nannually based on financial data from the prior year. \nExpansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and \nincreased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have \nresulted in increases and in the future may result in further \nincreases in our G-SIB surcharge and a corresponding \nincrease in our capital requirements. Effective on January 1, \n2026, our G-SIB surcharge is expected to increase from 3.0% \nto 3.5%. The July 2023 proposal from the FRB would \nintroduce additional granularity in the surcharge buckets and \nincrease the amount of financial data used in the calculation \nof the G-SIB surcharge based on averages over the year, as \nopposed to period-end values, which could increase our G-\nSIB surcharge.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the \nGDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to \nthe privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, \nand any failure to comply with these laws and regulations \ncould expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As \nnew privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, \nthe time and resources needed for us to comply with such \nlaws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for \nnon-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data \nbreaches, may significantly increase. \nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws \nand regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data \non-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. \nCompliance with these laws and regulations may require us \nto change our policies, procedures and technology for \ninformation security, which could, among other things, make \nus more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, \ncorruption or loss of information or technology.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n47\nOur consumer-oriented deposit-taking and credit card \nbusinesses subject us to numerous additional regulations in \nthe jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only \nare these regulations extensive, but they involve types of \nregulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance \nrisks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of \nregulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting \nfinancial interactions with consumers is often much greater \nthan that associated with doing business with institutions and \nhigh-net-worth individuals. Complying with these regulations \nis time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased \nrisks.\nGS Bank USA is assessed pursuant to a strategic plan for \nCRA compliance purposes. Any failure to comply with CRA \nrequirements could negatively impact GS Bank USA’s CRA \nratings, cause reputational harm and result in limits on our \nability to make future acquisitions or engage in certain new \nactivities.\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold \nfinancial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients \nwhere they have determined that the financial institution \nshould have detected that the client was engaged in \nwrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no \ndirect knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. \nRegulators and courts have also increasingly found liability \nas a “control person” for activities of entities in which \nfinancial institutions or funds controlled by financial \ninstitutions have an investment, but which they do not \nactively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue \nto seek to establish “fiduciary” obligations to counterparties \nto which no such duty had been thought to exist. To the \nextent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and \nliabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, \nmarket-making, prime financing, investing and other similar \nactivities could increase significantly. To the extent that we \nhave fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a \nfinancial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for \nindividual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, \nany breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations \ncould have materially negative legal, regulatory and \nreputational consequences.\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which our \nbusinesses are subject, see “Business — Regulation” in Part I, \nItem 1 of this Form 10-K.\nA failure to appropriately identify and address \npotential conflicts of interest has in the past and may \nin the future adversely affect our businesses.\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, \nwe regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including \nsituations where our services to a particular client or our own \ninvestments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to \nconflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as \nwell as situations where one or more of our businesses have \naccess to material non-public information that may not be \nshared with our other businesses and situations where we \nmay be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an \nadvisory or other relationship.\nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened \nregulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with \nrespect to transactions between GS Bank USA and its \nsubsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as \naffiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions \nbetween us and covered funds.\nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are designed \nto identify and address conflicts of interest, including those \ndesigned to prevent the improper sharing of information \namong our businesses. However, appropriately identifying \nand dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, \nand our reputation, which is one of our most important \nassets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to \nenter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if \nwe fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal \nappropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential \nor perceived conflicts have in the past and may in the future \ngive rise to litigation, government investigations or \nenforcement actions. Additionally, our One Goldman Sachs \ninitiative, as well as the alignment of our businesses, aim to \nincrease collaboration among our businesses, which may \nincrease the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of \ninterest and improper information sharing.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n48\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe \nmay \nbe \nadversely \naffected \nby \nincreased \ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative \npublicity.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies \nand law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating \nto compensation, our business practices, our past actions and \nother matters remains at high levels. Political and public \nsentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past \nresulted and may in the future result in a significant amount \nof adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or \ncharges by regulators or other government officials. Press \ncoverage and other public statements that assert some form \nof wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and \npublic statements that do not directly involve us) often result \nin some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and \nlaw enforcement officials or in lawsuits. \nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of \nthe ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming \nand expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior \nmanagement from our business. Penalties and fines sought by \nregulatory authorities have increased substantially and \ncertain regulators have been more likely in recent years to \ncommence enforcement actions or to support legislation \ntargeted at the financial services industry. Governmental \nauthorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or \nother actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or \nguilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry \nor investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having \npreviously engaged in criminal, regulatory or other \nmisconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and \nlegal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative \nimpact on our reputation and on the morale and performance \nof our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses \nand results of operations. Further, we are subject to \nregulatory settlements, orders and feedback that require \nsignificant remediation activities and enhancements to \nexisting controls, systems and procedures, which has required \nand will require us to commit significant resources, including \nhiring, as well as testing the operation and effectiveness of \nnew controls, policies and procedures. The failure to \ncomplete these remediation activities in a timely manner \ncould lead to higher operating expenses, reputational damage \nand other negative consequences.\nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses \nin particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our \nreputation and businesses may be adversely affected by \nnegative publicity or information regarding our businesses, \npersonnel, corporate engagement programs and other \ninitiatives, whether or not accurate or true, that may be \nposted on social media or other internet forums or published \nby news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may \nalso adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other \nparties that owe us money, securities or other assets and \nincrease the chance that they will not perform their \nobligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their \nuse of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which \ninformation can be disseminated through these channels, in \nparticular social media, may magnify risks relating to \nnegative publicity.\nIn 2023, the rapid dissemination of negative information \nthrough social media, in part, is believed to have led to the \ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). SVB suffered a level of \ndeposit withdrawals within a time period not previously \nexperienced by a financial institution. We could also be \nsubject to rapid deposit withdrawals or other outflows as a \nresult of negative social media posts or other negative \npublicity. \nSubstantial civil or criminal liability or significant \nregulatory action against us has in the past had and \nmay in the future have material adverse financial \neffects and significant reputational consequences, \nwhich in turn could seriously harm our business \nprospects.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the \nvolume of claims and amount of damages and penalties \nclaimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against \nfinancial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this \nForm 10-K for information about certain of our legal and \nregulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal \nclaims by consumers and clients increase in a market \ndownturn and employment-related claims increase following \nperiods in which we have reduced our headcount. \nAdditionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and \nare parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may \nface future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or \nother governmental entities, as well as follow-on civil \nlitigation that is often commenced after regulatory \nsettlements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n49\nSignificant settlements by large financial institutions, \nincluding, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have \nbecome common. The trend of large settlements with \ngovernmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for \nother financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, in \nsimilar actions, especially where governmental officials have \nannounced that the large settlements will be used as the basis \nor a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory \nenforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate \nprobable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities \nbetween legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or \npenalties. \nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become \nmore common. Financial institutions (including us) have been \nsubject to civil cases and investigatory demands relating to \nalleged bid-rigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive \npractices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and \nseveral liability and treble damages. These claims have \nresulted in significant settlements and fines for us in the past \nand may do so in the future.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including \nthe FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and \nillegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, \ngovernment officials and others. Violation of these or similar \nlaws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in \nthe future result in significant monetary penalties. Such \nviolations could also result in severe restrictions on our \nactivities and damage to our reputation.\nCertain law enforcement authorities have recently required \nadmissions of wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal \npleas, as part of the resolutions of matters brought against \nfinancial institutions or their employees. See for example, \n“1MDB-Related Matters” in Note 27 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any \nsuch resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our \nemployees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, \ncould adversely affect our reputation, could result in \npenalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our \nactivities generally or in certain circumstances and could have \nother negative effects. Further, as a result of this type of \nsettlement, we are no longer a “well-known seasoned issuer,” \nwhich places limitations on the manner in which we can \nmarket our securities.\nIn conducting our businesses around the world, we \nare subject to political, legal, regulatory, tax and other \nrisks that are inherent in operating in many countries.\nIn conducting our businesses and supporting our global \noperations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, \nexpropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange \ncontrols, communications and other content restrictions, and \nother restrictive governmental actions. For example, \nsanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on \ncertain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. \nIn many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the \nsecurities and financial services industries and many of the \ntransactions in which we are involved are uncertain and \nevolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact \nrequirements of local laws in every market. We have been, in \nsome cases, subject to divergent and conflicting laws and \nregulations across markets, and we are increasingly subject to \nthe risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate have \nimplemented or may implement laws and regulations that \ndirectly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any \ndetermination by local regulators that we have not acted in \ncompliance with the application of local laws in a particular \nmarket or our failure to develop effective working \nrelationships with local regulators could have a significant \nand negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, \nbut also on our reputation generally. Further, in some \njurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws \nand regulations has subjected and may in the future subject \nus and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also \ncriminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to \nthe enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be \nlegally enforceable in all cases. \nWhile business and other practices throughout the world \ndiffer, our principal entities are subject in their operations \nworldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and \nillegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as \nwell as laws relating to doing business with certain \nindividuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the BSA \nand the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and \ncontinue to invest significant resources in training and in \ncompliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our \noperations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the \nvendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly \nincreases the risk that we may be found in violation of such \nrules or regulations and such violations have in the past and \ncould in the future subject us to significant penalties or \nadversely affect our reputation. See for example, “1MDB-\nRelated Matters” in Note 27 to the consolidated financial \nstatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n50\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn addition, there have been a number of highly publicized \ncases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or \nother misconduct by employees in the financial services \nindustry, and we have had and may in the future have \nemployee misconduct. This misconduct has included and \nmay also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or \ncircumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or \nmisappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary \ninformation, including proprietary software. It is not always \npossible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the \nprecautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have \nnot been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by \nthe settlements relating to 1MDB.\nThe \napplication \nof \nregulatory \nstrategies \nand \nrequirements in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions \nto facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial \ninstitutions could create greater risk of loss for Group \nInc.’s security holders.\nAs described in “Business — Regulation — Banking \nSupervision and Regulation — Insolvency of an IDI or a \nBHC,” if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the \nrights of Group Inc.’s creditors would be determined under \nOLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of \ncreditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, \nincluding the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the \nstrict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which \ncould have a material adverse effect on our debtholders.\nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy \nmay be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large \nfinancial institution in a manner that would, among other \nthings, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other \ncreditors of the top-tier BHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while \nthe BHC’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible \nthat the application of the single point of entry strategy under \nOLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter \nresolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank \nand other operating entities would not enter resolution \nproceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.’s \nsecurity holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating \nrate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would \nresult from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a \ndifferent resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry \nresolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material \nsubsidiaries.\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and \nsupport from Group Inc. or other resources available to its \nsubsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to \nremain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be \ntransferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group \nInc.’s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s \nsubsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and \nGroup Inc.’s security holders (including our shareholders, \ndebtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face \nsignificant and possibly complete losses. In that case, Group \nInc.’s security holders would face losses while the third-party \ncreditors of Group Inc.’s subsidiaries would incur no losses \nbecause the subsidiaries would continue to operate and \nwould not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In \naddition, holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and \nholders of Group Inc.’s other debt securities could face losses \nahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution \nunder OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, \nto disregard the priority of creditor claims.\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause \ncreditors and shareholders of the financial company in \nreceivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to \nsuch losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would \ngenerally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims \nof private creditors, including senior creditors.\nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including \ndebtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity \nor other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc.’s \nassets are transferred. If such a securities-for-claims exchange \nwere implemented, there can be no assurance that the value \nof the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to \nrepay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for \nwhich the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has \nissued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how \nthe FDIC might exercise this authority are known and \nadditional rulemaking is possible.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n51\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the \nE.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provide \nresolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing \nentity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its \nunsecured debt into equity. Such “bail-in” powers are \nintended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution \nby allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured \ndebtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a \ncertain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to \nour material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger \nto expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such \n“bail-in” \npowers \nin \ncertain \ncircumstances. \nIf \nthe \nintercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is \n“bailed in,” Group Inc.’s claims on its subsidiaries would be \nsubordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries’ third-party \ncreditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering \nand non-U.S. authorities have adopted requirements that \ncertain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain \nminimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that \nwould pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top-tier \nBHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC \nin the event of failure.\nThe application of Group Inc.’s proposed resolution \nstrategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.’s \nsecurity holders.\nIn our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under \nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our \nresolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry \nstrategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC \n(Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group \nInc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major \nsubsidiaries, \nincluding \nthrough \nthe \nforgiveness \nof \nintercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of \nintercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional \nintercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors \nof some or all of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries would \nreceive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.’s \nsecurity holders could face significant and possibly complete \nlosses. \nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed \nFunding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated \nfunding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred \ncertain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its \nGCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional \nGCLA above prescribed thresholds.\nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support \nAgreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our \nmajor subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has \nprovided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that \nallows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash \nneeds during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if \nour financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution \nmay be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will \nautomatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated \nfunding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all \nintercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to \nGroup Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their \nmaturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will \nbe obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining \nintercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount \nto fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, \nand (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and \nliquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.’s and \nFunding IHC’s obligations under the CLSA are secured \npursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would \nmaterially and adversely affect Group Inc.’s liquidity. As a \nresult, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it \notherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement \nhad not been implemented.\nIf Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy were successful, \nGroup Inc.’s security holders could face losses while the \nthird-party creditors of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries \nwould incur no losses because those subsidiaries would \ncontinue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy \nproceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also \nseek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations \nrelating to its major subsidiaries’ derivative contracts or \ntransfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early \ntermination rights would be stayed under the ISDA \nProtocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of \nGroup Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group \nInc.’s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the \nbeneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible \nthat holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and other \ndebt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly \nsituated creditors of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries. \nIf Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy were not \nsuccessful, Group Inc.’s financial condition would be \nadversely impacted and Group Inc.’s security holders, \nincluding debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse \nposition than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all \ncases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our \nability to make such payments and are therefore subject to \nour credit risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Additionally, rising climate change \nconcerns have led to additional laws and regulations, \nregulatory scrutiny and disclosure obligations that have \nincreased and could further increase the operating costs and \ncould adversely affect the profitability of certain of our \ninvestments and activities.\nThere may be substantial costs in complying with current or \nfuture laws and regulations relating to our commodities-\nrelated activities and investments. Compliance with these \nlaws and regulations requires significant commitments of \ncapital toward environmental and operational monitoring, \ndevelopment of appropriate operational and supervisory \nprocedures and processes, payment of emission fees and \ncarbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, \npermits and licenses. \nCommodities involved in our intermediation activities and \ninvestments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or \ncatastrophic events, which are likely to be outside of our \ncontrol, including those arising from the breakdown or \nfailure of third-party or service providers' transport vessels, \nstorage facilities or other equipment or processes or other \nmechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of \nhazardous substances, performance below expected levels of \noutput or efficiency, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events \nor other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic \nevents. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service \nproviders to perform their contractual obligations and any \nfailure on their part, including the failure to supply or to \nsafely transport or store commodities, could expose us to \ncosts or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential \nrisks, we do not have insurance to cover some of these risks \nand the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover \nour losses.\nThe occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from \nperforming under our agreements with clients, may impair \nour operations or financial results and may result in \nlitigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other \nreputational harm.\nWe have made changes to and may also be required to divest \nor discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or \nlegal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbon-\ndependent economy in response to climate change. \nCompetition\nOur results have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by the composition of our client \nbase.\nOur client base is not the same as that of our major \ncompetitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower \npercentage of clients in certain industries or markets than \nsome or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable \nindustry developments or market conditions affecting certain \nindustries or markets have resulted in the past and may result \nin the future in our businesses underperforming relative to \nsimilar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a \nhigher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. \nFor example, our market-making businesses have a higher \npercentage of clients with actively managed assets than some \nof our competitors and these clients have in the past been and \nmay in the future be disproportionately affected by low \nvolatility. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n53\nCorrespondingly, \nfavorable \nor \nsimply \nless \nadverse \ndevelopments or market conditions involving industries or \nmarkets in a business where we have a lower concentration \nof clients in that industry or market have also resulted in the \npast and may result in the future in our underperforming \nrelative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher \nconcentration of clients in that industry or market. For \nexample, we have a smaller corporate client base in our \nmarket-making businesses than some of our peers and \ntherefore those competitors may benefit more from increased \nactivity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not \nhistorically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the \nsame extent as other financial institutions, which has in the \npast affected and could in the future adversely affect our \nmarket share in equities execution.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive.\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are \nintensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We \ncompete on the basis of a number of factors, including \ntransaction execution, our products and services, innovation, \nreputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been \nsubstantial consolidation and convergence among companies \nin the financial services industry. This has hastened the \nglobalization of the securities and other financial services \nmarkets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to \nsupport our international operations and to execute large \nglobal transactions. As we have expanded into new business \nareas and new geographic regions, we have faced competitors \nwith more experience and more established relationships \nwith clients, regulators and industry participants in the \nrelevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to \nexpand our businesses.\nGovernments and regulators have adopted regulations, \nimposed taxes, adopted compensation restrictions or \notherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted \nor may impact our ability to conduct certain of our \nbusinesses in a cost-effective manner or at all in certain or all \njurisdictions, including proposals relating to restrictions on \nthe type of activities in which financial institutions are \npermitted to engage. These or other similar rules, many of \nwhich do not apply to all our U.S. or non-U.S. competitors, \ncould impact our ability to compete effectively. \nPricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses \nhave continued to increase, particularly in situations where \nsome of our competitors may seek to increase market share \nby reducing prices. For example, in connection with \ninvestment banking and other assignments, in response to \ncompetitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended \nand priced credit at levels that, in some cases, have not fully \ncompensated us for the risks we undertook. \nThe financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a \nsignificant volume of transactions occur among a limited \nnumber of members of that industry. Many transactions are \nsyndicated to other financial institutions, and financial \ninstitutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has \nled to claims by other market participants and regulators that \nsuch institutions have colluded in order to manipulate \nmarkets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust \nlaws have been violated. While we have extensive procedures \nand controls that are designed to identify and prevent such \nactivities, they may not be effective. Allegations of such \nactivities, particularly by regulators, can have a negative \nreputational impact and can subject us to large fines and \nsettlements, and potentially significant penalties, including \ntreble damages.\nThe growth of electronic trading and the introduction \nof new products and technologies, including trading \nand \ndistributed \nledger \ntechnologies, \nsuch \nas \ncryptocurrencies, and AI technologies, has increased \ncompetition.\nTechnology is fundamental to our business and our industry. \nThe growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new \ntechnologies is changing our businesses and presenting us \nwith new challenges. Securities, futures and options \ntransactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on \nour own systems and through other alternative trading \nsystems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative \ntrading systems will continue. Some of these alternative \ntrading systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-\nbased market-making activities, and we may experience \ncontinued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In \naddition, the increased use by our clients of low-cost \nelectronic trading systems and direct electronic access to \ntrading markets has caused and could continue to cause a \nreduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients \nincreasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, \nwe may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order \nrouting and execution infrastructure. \nWe have invested significant resources into the development \nof electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, \nbut there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these \nsystems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the \ngenerally lower commissions arising from electronic trades.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n54\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new \ntechnologies, including distributed ledgers, such as digital \nassets and blockchain, and AI technologies, have required us \nto invest resources to adapt our existing products and \nservices, and we expect to continue to make such \ninvestments, which could be material. The adoption and \nevolution of such new technologies may also increase our \ncompliance and regulatory costs. Further, technologies, such \nas those based on distributed ledgers, that do not require \nintermediation could also significantly disrupt payments \nprocessing \nand \nother \nfinancial \nservices. \nRegulatory \nlimitations on our involvement in products and platforms \ninvolving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies \nmay not apply equally or, in some cases, at all to certain of \nour competitors. We may not be as timely or successful in \ndeveloping or integrating, or even able to develop or \nintegrate, new products and technologies, such as those built \non distributed ledgers or AI technologies, into our existing \nproducts and services, adapting to changes in client \npreferences or achieving market acceptance of our products \nand services., For example, our competitors may be more \ntimely or successful in developing or integrating AI \ntechnologies to increase their productivity and reduce their \ncosts or to provide better transaction execution or improved \nproducts and services to clients. Any of the foregoing could \naffect our ability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose \nmarket share or result in service disruptions and in turn \nreduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us.\nOur businesses would be adversely affected if we are \nunable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and \nefforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued \nability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage \nour businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses \nand geographic areas depends on our ability to attract and \nretain a talented workforce. Factors that affect our ability to \nattract and retain such employees include the level and \ncomposition of our compensation and benefits, our \nreputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly \nhiring, training and promoting qualified employees and \ngovernment policies, including immigration policy. As a \nsignificant portion of the compensation that we pay to our \nemployees is in the form of year-end discretionary \ncompensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of \ndeferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, \nor in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as \nregulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can \nnegatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly \nqualified employees.\nCompetition from within the financial services industry and \nfrom businesses outside the financial services industry, \nincluding the technology industry, for qualified employees \nhas often been intense. We have experienced increased \ncompetition in hiring and retaining employees to address the \ndemands of our consumer-oriented businesses and our \ntechnology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and \ngrowth markets, where we are often competing for qualified \nemployees with entities that have a significantly greater \npresence or more extensive experience in the region. \nLaws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations \nare located that affect taxes on our employees’ income or the \namount or composition of compensation, or that require us \nto disclose our or our competitors’ compensation practices, \nmay also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain \nqualified employees in those jurisdictions.\nAs described further in “Business — Regulation —\nCompensation Practices” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, \nour compensation practices are subject to review by, and the \nstandards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and \nbanking institution, we are subject to limitations on \ncompensation practices (which may or may not affect the \ncompanies with which we compete for talent) by the FRB, the \nPRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. \nThese limitations have shaped our compensation practices, \nwhich has, in some cases, adversely affected our ability to \nattract and retain talented employees, in particular in relation \nto companies not subject to these limitations, and future \nlegislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects.\nOur operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, \non our overall headcount and the proportion of our \nemployees located in strategic locations. Our future human \ncapital resource requirements and the benefits provided by \nstrategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the \nbenefits we anticipate.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n55\nMarket Developments and General Business \nEnvironment\nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity and \nresults of operations have been and may in the future \nbe adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic \nevents, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, wars, \nextreme weather events or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, \nincluding pandemics or other widespread health emergencies \n(or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), \nterrorist attacks, wars, extreme weather events, solar events \nor other natural disasters, could adversely affect our business, \nfinancial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These \nevents could have such effects through economic or financial \nmarket disruptions or challenging economic or market \nconditions more generally, the deterioration of our \ncreditworthiness or that of our counterparties, changes in \nconsumer sentiment and consumer borrowing, spending and \nsavings patterns, liquidity stress, or operational difficulties \n(such as travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in \nour offices) that impair our ability to manage our businesses.\nClimate change could disrupt our businesses and \nadversely \naffect \nclient \nactivity \nlevels \nand \nthe \ncreditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, \nand our actual or perceived action or inaction relating \nto climate change could result in damage to our \nreputation.\nClimate change may cause or be a contributing factor to \nextreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or \nmore of our primary locations, which may negatively affect \nour ability to service and interact with our clients, adversely \naffect the value of our investments, including our real estate \ninvestments, and reduce the availability or increase the cost \nof insurance. Climate change and the transition to a less \ncarbon-dependent economy may also have a negative impact \non the operations or financial condition of our clients and \ncounterparties, which may decrease revenues from those \nclients and counterparties and increase the credit risk \nassociated with loans and other credit exposures to those \nclients and counterparties. In addition, climate change may \nimpact the broader economy. \nWe are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public \npolicy, laws and regulations, or market and public \nperceptions and preferences in connection with the transition \nto a less carbon-dependent economy. These changes could \nadversely affect our business, results of operations and \nreputation. In addition, due to divergent stakeholder views \nregarding climate change, we are at increased risk that any \nactual or perceived action, or lack thereof, by us in \nconnection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent \neconomy will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders \nand adversely affect our business and reputation. If our \nresponse to climate change is subject to criticism, our \nbusiness, reputation and efforts to recruit and retain \nemployees may suffer. \nNew laws, regulations or guidance relating to climate change, \nas well as the perspectives of government officials, regulators, \nshareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding \nclimate change, may affect whether and on what terms and \nconditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain \nproducts. Federal and state, and non-U.S. banking regulators \nand \nsupervisory \nauthorities, \nshareholders \nand \nother \nstakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions \nas playing an important role in helping to address risks \nrelated to climate change, both directly and with respect to \ntheir clients, which may result in financial institutions coming \nunder increased requirements and expectations regarding the \ndisclosure and management of their climate risks and related \nlending, investment and advisory activities. For example, in \n2023 we participated in a pilot climate scenario analysis \nexercise conducted by the FRB, the results of which were \nreleased in 2024. We are also subject to interagency guidance \njointly issued by the FRB, FDIC, and OCC in 2023 regarding \nprinciples for climate-related financial risk management for \nlarge financial institutions. In addition, in 2023, the NYDFS \nissued guidance on the management of material financial \nrisks from climate change, which applies to New York State-\nregulated banking and mortgage institutions, including GS \nBank USA. Additionally, certain states in which we operate \nhave enacted or proposed laws or regulations regarding ESG \nmatters, including laws or regulations that require climate-\nrelated disclosures, that address the consideration of ESG \nfactors in state investments or contracting, and that require \nfinancial institutions to broadly provide customers with \naccess to financial services, many of which may have broad, \nextraterritorial application.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n56\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nIn the E.U., certain of our entities are expected to be subject \nin varying degrees to sustainability-related laws being \nimplemented, including directives, such as the CSRD and the \nCSDDD, which would significantly expand the scope of ESG \ndisclosure requirements applicable to us and impose stringent \ndue diligence requirements with respect to adverse human \nrights and environmental impacts in our upstream business \npartners’ operations, as well as require us to put into effect a \nclimate transition plan.\nThese, as well as any additional or heightened laws, \nregulations, guidance and expectations, have in the past \nsubjected and may in the future, subject us to different and \npotentially conflicting requirements and expectations in the \nvarious jurisdictions in which we operate, and have in the \npast resulted in and could in the future result in increased \nregulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital \nrequirements. The risks associated with, and the perspective \nof government officials, regulators, shareholders, employees \nand other stakeholders regarding, climate change are \ncontinuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to \nassess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related \nrisks and uncertainties, but we expect that climate change-\nrelated risks will increase over time. \nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results \nof operations have been adversely affected by \ndisruptions in the global economy caused by conflicts, \nand related sanctions and other developments.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has negatively \naffected the global economy. Governments around the world \nhave responded to Russia’s invasion by imposing economic \nsanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors, \nincluding price caps on Russian oil, and on Russian \nbusinesses and persons. Compliance with economic sanctions \nand restrictions imposed by governments has increased our \ncosts and otherwise adversely affected our business and may \ncontinue to do so. Russia has responded with its own \nrestrictions against investors and countries outside Russia \nand has proposed additional measures aimed at non-Russian \nowned businesses. Businesses in the U.S. and globally have \nexperienced shortages in materials and increased costs for \ntransportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the \nnegative effects of the conflict on the global economy. \nThe conflicts in the Middle East could also affect and harm \nour business and increase market uncertainty. The impact of \nthese conflicts on our business and operations is uncertain \nand therefore cannot be predicted.\nThe escalation or continuation of these conflicts or other \nhostilities could result in, among other things, an increased \nrisk of cyber attacks, an increased frequency and volume of \nfailures to settle securities transactions, supply chain \ndisruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and \nincreased volatility in commodity, currency and other \nfinancial markets. The extent and duration of the conflicts, \nsanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to \npredict, and the consequences for our business could be \nsignificant. \nIf \ninternational \npolitical \ninstability \nand \ngeopolitical tensions continue or increase in any region in \nwhich we do business, our business and results of operations \ncould be harmed. See “Management’s Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — \nRisk Management — Credit Risk Management — Selected \nExposures — Country Exposures” for further information \nabout our credit exposure to Russia and Ukraine. \nCertain \nof \nour \nbusinesses \nand \nour \nfunding \ninstruments may be adversely affected by changes in \nreference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs \nto which products we offer or funding that we raise are \nlinked.\nMany of the products that we own or that we offer, such as \nstructured notes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, \npay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at \nmaturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by \nreference to an index, currency, basket, ETF or other \nfinancial metric (the underlier). In the event that the \ncomposition of the underlier is significantly changed, by \nreference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the \nunderlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a \ncountry withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or \ndelinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an \nindex or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an \nindex or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become \nimpermissible to be included in the index or ETF), the \nunderlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market \nbenchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on \nlinking a financial instrument to the underlier, we may \nexperience adverse effects. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n57\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results \nof \noperations \nmay \nbe \nadversely \naffected \nby \ndisruptions in the global economy caused by \nescalating tensions between the U.S. and China.\nContinued or escalating tensions between the U.S. and China \nhave resulted in and may result in additional changes to U.S. \ninternational trade and investment policies, which could \ndisrupt international trade and investment, adversely affect \nfinancial markets, including market activity levels, and \nadversely impact our revenues. Continued or escalating \ntensions may also lead to the U.S., China or other countries \ntaking other actions, which could include the implementation \nof sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the large-\nscale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or restrictions on cross-\nborder trade, investment or transfer of information or \ntechnology. Any such developments could adversely affect \nour or our clients’ businesses, as well as our financial \ncondition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly \nmaterially.\nA conflict, or concerns about a potential conflict, involving \nChina and Taiwan, the U.S. or other countries could \nnegatively impact financial markets and our or our clients’ \nbusinesses. Trade restrictions by the U.S. or other countries \nin response to a conflict or potential conflict involving China, \nincluding financial and economic sanctions and export \ncontrols against certain organizations or individuals, or \nactions taken by China in response to trade restrictions, \ncould negatively impact our or our clients’ ability to conduct \nbusiness in certain countries or with certain counterparties \nand could negatively impact regional and global financial \nmarkets and economic conditions. Any of the foregoing could \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity \nand results of operations, possibly materially. \nWe face enhanced risks as we operate in new \nlocations and transact with a broader array of clients \nand counterparties.\nOur businesses, have in the past, and may in the future, bring \nus into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and \nentities that are not within our traditional client and \ncounterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new \nmarkets, and present us with integration challenges. For \nexample, we continue to transact business and invest in new \nregions, including a wide range of emerging and growth \nmarkets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various \nemerging and growth market countries have experienced \nsevere economic and financial disruptions, including \nsignificant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or \nthreatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency \nexchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their \neconomies. The possible effects of any of these conditions \ninclude an adverse impact on our businesses and increased \nvolatility in financial markets generally. \nIn our consumer-oriented activities, we have faced and \ncontinue to face compliance, legal and regulatory risk, \nincreased reputational risk and increased operational risk due \nto, among other things, higher transaction volumes and \nsignificantly increased retention and transmission of \nconsumer and client information. We are also subject to \nadditional legal requirements, including with respect to \nsuitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation \nBest Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy \nlaws and regulations). Further, identity fraud may increase \nand credit reporting practices may change in a manner that \nmakes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, \nto evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.\nIn connection with our transaction banking activities, we face \ncompliance, legal and regulatory risk, including with respect \nto \nknow-your-customer, \nanti-money \nlaundering \nand \nreporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of \nproperty belonging to countries, entities and individuals \nsubject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental \nauthorities. We are making significant enhancements to \nexisting controls, systems and procedures to manage these \nrisks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n58\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nNew business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced \nrisks, \nincluding \nrisks \nassociated \nwith \ndealing \nwith \ngovernmental entities, reputational concerns arising from \ndealing with different types of clients, business partners, \ncounterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of \nthese activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereign \nand operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of \nterrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in \nwhich certain assets are being operated or held or in which \nwe \ninteract \nwith \nthese \nclients, \nbusiness \npartners, \ncounterparties \nand \ninvestors. \nLegal, \nregulatory \nand \nreputational risks may also exist in connection with activities \nand transactions involving new products or markets where \nthere is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or \nconflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the \njurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such \nproducts may involve multiple jurisdictions.\nWe have developed and pursued new business and strategic \ninitiatives, including acquisitions, and may continue to do so. \nIf and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute \nthose initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, \nand face other adverse consequences, such as negative \nreputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing \nthose initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the \nbenefits that we expect to realize from them, such as \ngenerating additional revenues, achieving expense savings, \nreducing operational risk exposures or using capital and \nfunding more efficiently. Engaging in new activities exposes \nus to a variety of risks, including that we may be unable to \nsuccessfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective \nsystems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary \npersonnel. Due to our lack of historical experience with \nunsecured consumer lending, our loan loss assumptions may \nprove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly \nabove those which we originally anticipated in entering the \nbusiness. \nIn recent years, we have invested, and may continue to invest, \nmore in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level \nof more consistent revenues. Such investments and \nacquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to \nour other businesses. \nWe may not be able to fully realize the expected \nbenefits or synergies from acquisitions or other \nbusiness initiatives in the time frames we expect, or at \nall.\nWe have engaged in selective acquisitions and may continue \nto do so in the future and these acquisitions may, individually \nor in the aggregate, be material to us. Any future acquisitions \ncould involve the issuance of common stock and/or the \npayment of cash as consideration. The success of our \nacquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate \nthe acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies, cost \nsavings and growth opportunities. For example, in 2024, we \nsold GreenSky Holdings, LLC, which we had previously \nacquired, and in connection with the disposition we incurred \na write-down of intangible assets and goodwill. Also in 2024, \nwe entered into an agreement to transition the GM credit \ncard program to another issuer and have incurred a write-\ndown of intangible assets in connection with that transaction. \nIn any future acquisitions, we may face numerous risks and \nuncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant \nbusinesses and systems, including the need to combine or \nseparate accounting and data processing systems and \nmanagement controls and to integrate relationships with \nclients, counterparties, regulators and others in connection \nwith acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses is time-\nconsuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses, \nproduce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties, cause \nus to incur incremental expenses or require incremental \nfinancial, management and other resources. It is also possible \nthat an acquisition, once announced, may not close due to the \nfailure to satisfy applicable closing conditions, such as the \nreceipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals.\nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be \nsuccessfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefits \nand synergies in the time frames that we expect, or at all. If \nwe are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully, our \nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows \ncould be adversely affected.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Properties\nIn the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas, we have offices \nconsisting of approximately 6.3 million square feet of leased \nand owned space. Our principal executive offices are located \nat 200 West Street, New York, New York and consist of \napproximately 2.1 million square feet. The building is located \non a parcel leased from Battery Park City Authority pursuant \nto a ground lease. Under the lease, Battery Park City \nAuthority holds title to all improvements, including the office \nbuilding, subject to our right of exclusive possession and use \nuntil June 2069, the expiration date of the lease. Under the \nterms of the ground lease, we made a lump sum ground rent \npayment in June 2007 of $161 million for rent through the \nterm of the lease. \nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we have offices \nconsisting of approximately 1.8 million square feet of leased \nand owned space. Our European headquarters is located in \nLondon at Plumtree Court, consisting of approximately \n826,000 square feet under a lease which can be terminated in \n2039.\nIn Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we have offices \nconsisting of approximately 2.9 million square feet, including \nour offices in India, and regional headquarters in Tokyo and \nHong Kong. In India, we have offices with approximately 1.9 \nmillion square feet, the majority of which have leases that \nwill expire starting in 2028.\nIn the preceding paragraphs, square footage figures are \nprovided only for properties that are used in the operation of \nour businesses. We regularly evaluate our space capacity in \nrelation to current and projected headcount. We may incur \nexit costs in the future if we (i) reduce our space capacity or \n(ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in locations in \nwhich we operate and dispose of existing space that had been \nheld for potential growth. These costs may be material to our \noperating results in a given period. \nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and \narbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in \nconnection with the conduct of our businesses.

Diluted earnings per \ncommon share (EPS) was $40.54 for 2024, compared with \n$22.87 for 2023. ROE was 12.7% for 2024, compared with \n7.5% for 2023. Book value per common share was $336.77 as \nof December 2024, 7.4% higher compared with December \n2023. \nNet revenues were $53.51 billion for 2024, 16% higher than \n2023, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in Global \nBanking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. The \nincrease in net revenues in Global Banking & Markets \nprimarily reflected higher net revenues in Equities, \nsignificantly higher Investment banking fees and higher net \nrevenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities \n(FICC). The increase in net revenues in Asset & Wealth \nManagement primarily reflected significantly higher net \nrevenues in Equity investments and higher Management and \nother fees. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were slightly \nhigher. \nProvision for credit losses was $1.35  billion for 2024, \ncompared with $1.03  billion for 2023. Provisions for 2024 \nreflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio \n(primarily driven by net charge-offs). Provisions for 2023 \nreflected net provisions related to both the credit card \nportfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale \nloans (primarily driven by impairments), partially offset by \nreserve reductions related to the transfer of the GreenSky \nloan portfolio to held for sale and the sale of substantially all \nof the Marcus by Goldman Sachs (Marcus) loan portfolio. \nOperating expenses were $33.77 billion for 2024, 2% lower \nthan 2023, reflecting decreases driven by significantly lower \nexpenses, including impairments, related to commercial real \nestate in consolidated investment entities (CIEs) and other \nsignificant expenses recognized in the prior year, including \nthe write-down of identifiable intangible assets related to \nGreenSky Holdings, LLC (GreenSky), an impairment of \ngoodwill related to Consumer platforms and the FDIC \nspecial assessment fee. These decreases were partially offset \nby higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting \nimproved operating performance) and higher transaction \nbased expenses. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses \ndivided by total net revenues) was 63.1% for 2024, compared \nwith 74.6% for 2023. \nDuring 2024, we returned a total of $11.80 billion of capital \nto common shareholders, including $8.00 billion of common \nshare repurchases and $3.80 billion of common stock \ndividends. As of December 2024, our CET1 capital ratio was \n15.0% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 15.3% \nunder the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the \nconsolidated financial statements for further information \nabout our capital ratios.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n63\nBusiness Environment \nIn 2024, the global economy grew, but was impacted \nthroughout the year by broad macroeconomic and \ngeopolitical concerns. Concerns regarding inflation and \nongoing geopolitical stresses, including tensions with China \nand the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, remained \nelevated. Despite these concerns, the economy in the U.S. has \nremained resilient and equity markets have reacted favorably \nto the outcomes of national elections. Additionally, markets \nwere focused on policy interest rate cuts by several central \nbanks, including the first rate cut by U.S. Federal Reserve \nsince it began increasing the rate in 2022.\nThere remains uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical \nrisks, central bank policy and inflation. See “Results of \nOperations — Segment Assets and Operating Results — \nSegment Operating Results” for further information about \nthe operating environment for each of our business segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies \nFair Value \nFair Value Hierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities, certain \ninvestments and loans, and certain other financial assets and \nliabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at \nfair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or \nlosses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of \nearnings. The use of fair value to measure financial \ninstruments is fundamental to our risk management practices \nand is our most critical accounting policy. \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that \nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \nliability \nin \nan \norderly \ntransaction \nbetween \nmarket \nparticipants at the measurement date. We measure certain \nfinancial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its \nnet exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining \nfair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted \naccounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest \npriority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for \nidentical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) \nthe next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are \nobservable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and \n(iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in \nmarket activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance \nof a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a \nportfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and \nliabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest \nlevel of input that is significant to their fair value \nmeasurement. \nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and \nliabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are \nclassified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require \nappropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant \nwould require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as \ncounterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer \nrestrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. \nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are \nthose which require one or more significant inputs that are \nnot observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.2% as \nof December 2024 and 1.5% as of December 2023 of our total \nassets. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for further information about level 3 financial \nassets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related \nfair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, \ninstruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are \ninitially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be \nthe best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the \ntransaction date, we use other methodologies to determine \nfair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. \nEstimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments \nrequires judgments to be made. These judgments include: \n• Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/\nor model for each type of level 3 financial instrument; \n• Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all \nrelevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced \nby market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, \nvolatilities and correlations; and \n• Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including \nthose related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality. \nRegardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and \nassumptions are only changed when corroborated by \nsubstantive evidence. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n64\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nControls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. \nMarket makers and investment professionals in our revenue-\nproducing units are responsible for pricing our financial \ninstruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the \nrevenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that \nall of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at \nmarket-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference \nof opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of \nfinancial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to \nmarket comparables or trade comparison, as described \nbelow), the final valuation decision is made by senior \nmanagers in our independent price verification function \nwithin Controllers. This independent price verification is \ncritical to ensuring that our financial instruments are \nproperly valued. \nPrice Verification. All financial instruments at fair value \nclassified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are \nsubject to our independent price verification process. The \nobjective of price verification is to have an informed and \nindependent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial \ninstruments under review. Instruments that have one or more \nsignificant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external \nmarket data are classified in level 3 of the fair value \nhierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our \nindependent price verification function within Controllers \ninclude: \n• Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal \nand external, where available) is used to determine the \nmost relevant pricing inputs and valuations. \n• External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are \ncompared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., \nbrokers or dealers, S&P Global Services, Bloomberg, ICE \nData Services, Pricing Direct, TRACE). Data obtained \nfrom various sources is compared to ensure consistency \nand validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-\nparty pricing vendors are used for valuation or price \nverification, greater priority is generally given to executable \nquotations. \n• Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based \ntransactions are used to corroborate the valuation of \npositions \nwith \nsimilar \ncharacteristics, \nrisks \nand \ncomponents. \n• Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are \nanalyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of \nrisk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to \nanother or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative \nto another. \n• Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are \nanalyzed to determine implied values, which are used to \ncorroborate our valuations. \n• Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, market-making \ndesks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide \nevidence of market-clearing levels. \n• Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison \nto values realized upon sales. \nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for \nfurther information about fair value measurements. \nReview of Net Revenues. We seek to ensure adherence to \nour pricing policy through a combination of daily \nprocedures, including the explanation and attribution of net \nrevenues based on the underlying factors. Through this \nprocess, we independently validate net revenues, identify and \nresolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a \ntimely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly \ncategorized and quantified. \nReview of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk \nmanagement group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative \nprofessionals who are separate from model developers, \nperforms an independent model review and validation \nprocess of our valuation models. New or changed models are \nreviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are \nreviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the \nproduct or market and any market developments in pricing \ntheories. \nSee \n“Risk \nManagement \n— \nModel \nRisk \nManagement” for further information about the review and \nvalidation of our valuation models.  \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related \nto our loans held for investment that are accounted for at \namortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, \nwe classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into \nwholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios \nrepresent the level at which we have developed and \ndocumented our methodology to determine the allowance for \ncredit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk \ncharacteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-\nspecific basis for loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n65\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the \nweighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic \nconditions over the expected life of the loans and lending \ncommitments. The expected life of each loan or lending \ncommitment is determined based on the contractual term \nadjusted for extension options or demand features, or is \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The \nforecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic \nscenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss \ninformation based on a non-linear modeled approach. We \napply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each \nquarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally \nderived economic outlook, market consensus, recent \nmacroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The \nforecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. \nRisk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit \nratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, \nmacroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and \nGDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial \nobligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan \nseniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by \nreal estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt \nservice ratio and home price index. The allowance for loan \nlosses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using \nthe present value of expected future cash flows discounted at \nthe loan’s effective rate, the observable market price of the \nloan, or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, the fair \nvalue of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if \napplicable. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans \ninclude Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic \nindicators. \nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative \ncomponents which allow management to reflect the uncertain \nnature \nof \neconomic \nforecasting, \ncapture \nuncertainty \nregarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision \nand concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by \nmanagement include, among others, changes and trends in \nloan \nportfolios, \nuncertainties \nassociated \nwith \nthe \nmacroeconomic \nand \ngeopolitical \nenvironments, \ncredit \nconcentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due \nand criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration \nwithin an industry or region. \nOur estimate of credit losses entails judgment about \ncollectability at the reporting dates, and there are \nuncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for \ncredit losses is subject to a governance process that involves \nsenior management within Risk and Controllers. Personnel \nwithin Risk are responsible for forecasting the economic \nvariables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used \nin the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the \nbest information available to determine this estimate, future \nadjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, \namong other things, changes in the economic environment or \nvariances between actual results and the original assumptions \nused. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan \nlosses when deemed to be uncollectible. \nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending \ncommitments which are held for investment that are \naccounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is \ndetermined using the same methodology as the allowance for \nloan losses, while also taking into consideration the \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such \ncommitments are cancellable by us. \nTo \nestimate \nthe \npotential \nimpact \nof \nan \nadverse \nmacroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit \nlosses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit \nlosses under the weighted average forecast used in the \ncalculation of allowance for credit losses as of December \n2024 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse \neconomic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a \n100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse \neconomic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global \nrecession in the first quarter of 2025 through the first quarter \nof 2026, resulting in an economic contraction and rising \nunemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse \neconomic scenario would have resulted in an approximate \n$0.9 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of \nDecember 2024. This hypothetical increase does not take into \nconsideration any potential adjustments to qualitative \nreserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are \ninherently uncertain and do not take into account any other \noffsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an \nadverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly \nfrom this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for further information about the allowance for \ncredit losses.\nUse of Estimates \nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and \nassumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in \nconnection with fair value measurements and the allowance \nfor credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for \ninvestment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of \nestimates and assumptions is also important in determining \nthe accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, \nprovisions for losses that may arise from litigation and \nregulatory \nproceedings \n(including \ngovernmental \ninvestigations), and accounting for income taxes. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n66\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth \nquarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances \nchange that indicate an impairment may exist. When \nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative \nassessment can be made to determine whether it is more \nlikely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting \nunit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the \nqualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative \ngoodwill test can be performed without performing a \nqualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our \nreporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair \nvalue estimates include projected earnings, allocated equity, \nprice-to-earnings multiples and price-to-book multiples. \nThere is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The \ncarrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of \ntotal shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated \namount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the \nactivities of the reporting unit under currently applicable \nregulatory capital requirements. During the third quarter of \n2024, in connection with the planned sale of our seller \nfinancing loan portfolio, we performed a quantitative \ngoodwill test and determined that the goodwill associated \nwith Transaction banking and other was impaired, and \naccordingly, recorded a $14 million impairment. In the fourth \nquarter of 2024, we performed our annual assessment of \ngoodwill for impairment, for each of our reporting units with \ngoodwill, by performing a qualitative assessment. As a result \nof the annual assessment, we determined that it was more \nlikely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting \nunit with goodwill exceeded its respective carrying value. \nTherefore, we determined that goodwill for each reporting \nunit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test \nwas not required. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for further information about our annual \nassessment of goodwill for impairment. If we experience a \nprolonged or severe period of weakness in the business \nenvironment, financial markets, the performance of one or \nmore of our reporting units or our common stock price, or \nadditional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill \ncould be impaired in the future. \nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when \nevents or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or \nasset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether indications of \npotential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable \nintangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment \nis recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows \nrelating to the asset or asset group is less than the \ncorresponding carrying value. During 2024, in connection \nwith the planned transition of the GM credit card program to \nanother issuer, we classified the GM credit card program to \nheld for sale and recognized a $72 million write-down of \nidentifiable intangible assets. See Note 12 to the consolidated \nfinancial \nstatements \nfor \nfurther \ninformation \nabout \nidentifiable intangible assets.\nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may \narise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the \nextent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably \nestimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the \nrange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the \nrelated reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings \nwhere we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See \nNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for \ninformation about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these \nestimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be \nmaterially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-\nby-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses \nafter considering, among other factors, the progress of each \ncase, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the \nexperience of others in similar cases, proceedings or \ninvestigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. \nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in \nthe financial statements only when it is more likely than not \nthat the position will be sustained on examination by the \nrelevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the \nposition. As of December 2024, our liability for unrecognized \ntax benefits was $2.16 billion. We use estimates to recognize \ncurrent and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state \nand local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. \nThe income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and \ncan be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers \nand taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these \ninterpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative \nappeals or judicial proceedings. We do not expect that the \nresolution of any such dispute will have a material impact on \nour financial condition, but it may be material to the \noperating results for a particular period, depending, in part, \non the operating results for that period. Our interpretations \nare reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently \navailable, tax examination experience and the opinions of \nlegal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred \ntaxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be \nrealized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As of \nDecember 2024, we had $11.01 billion of deferred tax assets \nwith a related valuation allowance of $2.06 billion.

The composition of net revenues can also vary over \nthe shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global \neconomic and market conditions. See “Risk Factors” in Part \nI, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about \nthe impact of economic and market conditions on our results \nof operations.

We believe that tangible \ncommon shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a \nmeasure that we and investors use to assess capital \nadequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it \nmeasures the performance of businesses consistently, \nwhether they were acquired or developed internally. \nTangible common shareholders’ equity and ROTE are \nnon-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar \nnon-GAAP measures used by other companies. \nThe table below presents our average equity and the \nreconciliation of average common shareholders’ equity to \naverage tangible common shareholders’ equity."

During 2024, the operating \nenvironment was generally characterized by continued broad \nmacroeconomic concerns, including concerns and uncertainty \nabout inflation, ongoing geopolitical tensions, central bank \npolicy and the potential outcome of national elections. In \ninvestment banking, industry-wide underwriting volumes \nincreased compared with 2023, driven by strong levels of debt \nofferings and improved levels of equity offerings, while \nindustry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes \nremained below historical averages. In market making, \nactivity levels were mixed, as activity levels in fixed income-\nrelated products decreased compared with the prior year, \nwhile activity levels in equity-related products increased. \nGlobal equity prices were generally higher compared with the \nend of 2023, and concerns about the commercial real estate \nmarket persisted. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment \nremained low and the pace of growth in consumer spending \nincreased slightly compared with 2023. \nIf uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical tensions and \nthe economic outlook remain elevated or grow, including \nthose about central bank policy, inflation and the commercial \nreal estate sector, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, a \ndecline in market-making activity levels, a decline in \nindustry-wide investment banking volumes, and net revenues \nand provision for credit losses would likely be negatively \nimpacted. See “Segment Assets and Operating Results — \nSegment Operating Results” for information about the \noperating environment and material trends and uncertainties \nthat may impact our results of operations. \n2024 versus 2023\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were \n$53.51 billion for 2024, 16% higher than 2023, primarily \nreflecting significantly higher other principal transactions \nrevenues, net interest income and investment banking \nrevenues and higher investment management revenues. \nNon-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in \nthe consolidated statements of earnings were $7.74 billion for \n2024, 24% higher than 2023, primarily reflecting significantly \nhigher revenues in debt underwriting, primarily driven by \nleveraged finance activity, and in equity underwriting, \nprimarily driven by secondary and initial public offerings. In \naddition, revenues in advisory were higher, reflecting an \nincrease in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions. \nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated \nstatements of earnings were $10.60 billion for 2024, 11% \nhigher than 2023, primarily due to higher management and \nother fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average \nassets under supervision (AUS). \nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of \nearnings were $4.09 billion for 2024, 8% higher than 2023, \ndue to higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting \ngenerally higher market volumes and increased transaction \nfees, partially offset by a loss related to the planned transition \nof the GM credit card program to another issuer.  \nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of \nearnings were $18.39 billion for 2024, essentially unchanged \ncompared with 2023. Market making revenues from \nintermediation activities were slightly higher, primarily \nreflecting significantly higher revenues in equity cash \nproducts, currencies and mortgages, offset by significantly \nlower revenues in commodities and equity derivatives. \nMarket making revenues from financing activities were \nessentially unchanged, reflecting significantly lower revenues \nin FICC financing, offset by significantly higher revenues \nfrom Equities financing. \nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated \nstatements of earnings were $4.65 billion for 2024, 119% \nhigher than 2023, primarily reflecting significantly higher net \ngains from investments in private equities, significantly \nhigher net gains from derivatives related to our funding \nactivities, the impact of the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio \nin 2023 (including net revenues of approximately $(370) \nmillion related to the sale of substantially all of the portfolio) \nand significantly lower net losses on hedges related to our \nrelationship lending portfolio. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n69\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in the \nconsolidated statements of earnings was $8.06 billion for \n2024, 27% higher than 2023, reflecting an increase in interest \nincome, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. \nThe increase in interest income primarily related to trading \nassets and investments (each reflecting the impact of higher \naverage balances and higher average interest rates), \ncollateralized agreements and other interest-earning assets \n(each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates), \npartially offset by a decrease in interest income related to \ndeposits with banks (reflecting the impact of lower average \nbalances). The increase in interest expense primarily related \nto collateralized financings and deposits (each reflecting the \nimpact of higher average balances and higher average interest \nrates) and other interest-bearing liabilities (reflecting the \nimpact of higher average interest rates). See “Supplemental \nFinancial \nInformation \n— \nStatistical \nDisclosures \n— \nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity” \nfor further information about our sources of net interest \nincome.\nProvision for Credit Losses \nProvision for credit losses consists of provision for credit \nlosses on financial assets and commitments accounted for at \namortized cost, including loans and lending commitments \nheld for investment.

Provision for credit losses in the \nconsolidated statements of earnings was $1.35 billion for \n2024, compared with $1.03 billion for 2023. Provisions for \n2024 reflected net provisions related to the credit card \nportfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs). Provisions for \n2023 reflected net provisions related to both the credit card \nportfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale \nloans (primarily driven by impairments), partially offset by \nreserve reductions of $637 million related to the transfer of \nthe GreenSky loan portfolio to held for sale and $442 million \nrelated to the sale of substantially all of the Marcus loan \nportfolio. \nOperating Expenses \nOur operating expenses are primarily influenced by \ncompensation, headcount and levels of business activity. \nCompensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end \ndiscretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards \nand other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation \nis significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of \nnet revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall \nfinancial performance, prevailing labor markets, business \nmix, the structure of our share-based awards and the external \nenvironment. \nThe table below presents our operating expenses by line item \nand headcount. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCompensation and benefits\n$ 16,706 $ 15,499 \n$ 15,148 \nTransaction based"

Our efficiency ratio was 63.1% for 2024, \ncompared with 74.6% for 2023. \nOperating expenses, compared with 2023, reflected decreases \ndriven by significantly lower expenses, including impairments \n($1.46 billion recognized in 2023), related to commercial real \nestate in CIEs (largely in depreciation and amortization) and \nother significant expenses recognized in the prior year, \nincluding the write-down of identifiable intangible assets \nrelated to GreenSky of $506 million and an impairment of \ngoodwill related to Consumer platforms of $504 million \n(both in depreciation and amortization), and the FDIC \nspecial assessment fee of $529 million (in other expenses). \nThese decreases were partially offset by higher compensation \nand benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating \nperformance) and higher transaction based expenses. An \nincremental expense for the FDIC special assessment fee of \n$71 million was recognized in 2024, as the FDIC notified \nbanks subject to the special assessment fee of the updated \nestimated cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from \nthe closures in 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature \nBank. \nNet \nprovisions \nfor \nlitigation \nand \nregulatory \nproceedings were $166 million for 2024 compared with $115 \nmillion for 2023.\nAs of December 2024, headcount increased 3% compared \nwith December 2023, primarily due to increases in Asset & \nWealth Management, Risk and Compliance, partially offset \nby the impact of the sale of GreenSky. \nProvision for Taxes \nThe effective income tax rate for 2024 was 22.4%, up from \nthe full year income tax rate of 20.7% for 2023, primarily due \nto a decrease in the impact of permanent tax benefits for 2024 \ncompared with 2023, partially offset by changes in the \ngeographic mix of earnings. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The U.K. and other \njurisdictions in which we operate have adopted certain \nportions of the OECD directive (Pillar II legislation) effective \nbeginning in calendar year 2024. The Pillar II legislation did \nnot have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2024. \nWe expect additional guidance or legislation to be issued by \nthe OECD and various jurisdictions during 2025 which could \nimpact any minimum tax we owe in future periods, possibly \nmaterially, and our effective tax rate could increase in 2025 \nand thereafter. This minimum tax, if any, will be recognized \nin the period in which it is incurred. \nOn August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in \nVarian Medical Systems, Inc. v.

We are monitoring the Varian \ndecision and evaluating its impact, which could be a material \nincome tax benefit, on the deemed repatriation tax we \nincurred for the 2018 tax year.

We provide advisory and \nunderwriting services and help companies raise capital to \nstrengthen and grow their businesses. Investment banking \nfees includes the following:\n• Advisory. Includes strategic advisory assignments with \nrespect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate \ndefense activities, restructurings and spin-offs. \n• Underwriting. Includes public offerings and private \nplacements in both local and cross-border transactions of a \nwide range of securities and other financial instruments, \nincluding acquisition financing. \nFICC. FICC generates revenues from intermediation and \nfinancing activities. \n• FICC intermediation.

Government bonds (including \ninflation-linked \nsecurities) \nacross \nmaturities, \nother \ngovernment-backed securities, and interest rate swaps, \noptions and other derivatives. \nCredit \nProducts. \nInvestment-grade \nand \nhigh-yield \ncorporate securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded \nfunds (ETFs), bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, \ndistressed debt and trade claims. \nMortgages. Commercial mortgage-related securities, \nloans \nand \nderivatives, \nresidential \nmortgage-related \nsecurities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government \nagency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and \nother securities and loans), and other asset-backed \nsecurities, loans and derivatives. \nCurrencies. Currency options, spot/forwards and other \nderivatives on G-10 currencies and emerging-market \nproducts. \nCommodities. Commodity derivatives and, to a lesser \nextent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and \npetroleum products, natural gas, agricultural, base, \nprecious and other metals, electricity, including renewable \npower, environmental products and other commodity \nproducts. \n• FICC financing.

Equities generates revenues from intermediation \nand financing activities. \n• Equities intermediation. We make markets in equity \nsecurities and equity-related products, including ETFs, \nconvertible securities, options, futures and OTC derivative \ninstruments. We also structure and make markets in \nderivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures \nand individual company stocks. Our exchange-based \nmarket-making activities include making markets in stocks \nand ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges \nworldwide. In addition, we generate commissions and fees \nfrom executing and clearing institutional client transactions \non major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, \nas well as OTC transactions.\n• Equities financing. Includes prime financing, which \nprovides financing to our clients for their securities trading \nactivities through margin loans that are generally \ncollateralized by securities or cash. Prime financing also \nincludes services which involve lending securities to cover \ninstitutional clients’ short sales and borrowing securities to \ncover our short sales and to make deliveries into the \nmarket.

In addition, we execute swap transactions to \nprovide our clients with exposure to securities and indices. \nFinancing activities also include portfolio financing, which \nclients can utilize to manage their investment portfolios, \nand other equity financing activities, including securities-\nbased loans to individuals.\nMarket-Making Activities\nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid \nand less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, \nsuch as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds \nand governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment \nobjectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to \nearn the difference between the price at which a market \nparticipant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price \nat which another market participant is willing to buy it from \nus, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we \nmaintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short \nperiod of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client \ndemand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk \nexposures that arise from these market-making activities \n(collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading \nassets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) \nin our consolidated balance sheets. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Due to the integrated nature of our \nmarket-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into \nclient activity and market-making inventory changes is \njudgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. \nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over \ntime as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated \nfactors affecting economic and market conditions, including \nvolatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest \nrates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices \nand commodity prices, investor confidence, and other \nmacroeconomic concerns and uncertainties. \nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions \nremain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer \nspreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and \ndecreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes \nin market-making conditions can materially impact client \nactivity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value \nof our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the \nmarket could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer \nspread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby \ndecreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit \nspreads on our inventory positions. \nOther.

Due to the nature of activities within FICC \nand Equities and the composition of their associated \nbalance sheet, we assess the performance of these \nbusinesses based on total net revenues, as offsets can occur \nacross revenue line items. For example, cash instruments \nthat generate interest income are, in some cases, hedged or \nfunded by derivatives for which changes in fair value are \nreflected in market making revenues.

In \naddition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary \nfrom amounts previously reported due to the subsequent \nwithdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction. \n• Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and \npublic common stock offerings, convertible offerings and \nrights offerings. \n• Debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, \nmortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and \ntaxable municipal debt.

This group includes the current capabilities of our \nfinancing group and expands its coverage to financial \nsponsors and alternative asset management firms. It also \nincludes an alternatives origination group focused on \nsourcing, to provide seamless coverage to our private credit \nand private equity clients. We believe that a more integrated \nset of these capabilities will allow us to better serve our \nclients as these private markets continue to grow.\nOperating Environment. During 2024, Global Banking & \nMarkets operated in an environment generally characterized \nby continued broad macroeconomic concerns, including \nconcerns and uncertainty about inflation, prolonged \ngeopolitical stresses and central bank policy, and the \npotential outcomes of the national elections.\nIn investment banking, industry-wide debt underwriting \nvolumes for the year increased significantly compared with \nthe prior year, driven by strong levels of leveraged finance \nand investment-grade offerings. However, industry-wide \nequity underwriting volumes, despite improving year-over-\nyear, and industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions \nvolumes remained below historical averages.\nIn interest rates, the yields on 10-year U.S. and U.K. \ngovernment bonds increased during the year. In equities, the \nS&P 500 Index increased by 23% and the MSCI World Index \nincreased by 16% compared with the end of 2023. \nIn the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate, \nand market-making activity levels decline, industry-wide \ninvestment banking volumes decline, or credit spreads related \nto hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net \nrevenues in Global Banking & Markets would likely be \nnegatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions \ndeteriorate or if the creditworthiness of borrowers \ndeteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be \nnegatively impacted. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n74\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n2024 versus 2023. Net revenues in Global Banking & \nMarkets were $34.94 billion for 2024, 16% higher than 2023. \nInvestment banking fees were $7.73 billion, 24% higher than \n2023, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in \nDebt underwriting, primarily driven by leveraged finance \nactivity, and in Equity underwriting, primarily driven by \nsecondary and initial public offerings. In addition, net \nrevenues in Advisory were higher, reflecting an increase in \ncompleted mergers and acquisitions transactions.  \nAs of December 2024, our Investment banking fees backlog \nincreased compared with the end of 2023, primarily reflecting \nhigher estimated net revenues from potential advisory \ntransactions. \nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from \nfuture transactions where we believe that future revenue \nrealization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our \nbacklog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels \nwhich, over the long term, impact our net revenues. \nHowever, the time frame for completion and corresponding \nrevenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies \nbased on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions \nmay remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In \naddition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as \nassumptions about the likelihood that individual client \ntransactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be \ncancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the \nestimate may also occur. \nNet revenues in FICC were $13.20 billion, 9% higher than \n2023, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in \nFICC financing, primarily driven by mortgages and \nstructured lending. Net revenues in FICC intermediation \nwere slightly higher, driven by significantly higher net \nrevenues in currencies, mortgages and credit products, largely \noffset by lower net revenues in interest rate products and \nsignificantly lower net revenues in commodities.\nThe increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected \nthe impact of improved market-making conditions on our \ninventory, partially offset by lower client activity.

Provisions for 2023 \nprimarily reflected net provisions related to the commercial \nreal estate portfolio.\nOperating expenses were $19.98 billion for 2024, 11% higher \nthan 2023, primarily due to significantly higher transaction \nbased expenses and higher compensation and benefits \nexpenses (reflecting improved operating performance).

We receive fees related to \nmanaging assets for institutional and individual clients, \nproviding investing and wealth advisory solutions, \nproviding financial planning and counseling services, and \nexecuting brokerage transactions for wealth management \nclients. The vast majority of revenues in management and \nother fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that \nwe manage.

The \nfees that we charge vary by asset class, client channel and \nthe types of services provided, and are affected by \ninvestment performance, as well as asset inflows and \nredemptions. \n• Incentive fees. In certain circumstances, we also receive \nincentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a \nseparately managed account’s return, or when the return \nexceeds a specified benchmark or other performance \ntargets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the \nincreased share of the income and gains derived primarily \nfrom our private equity and credit funds when the return \non a fund’s investments over the life of the fund exceeds \ncertain threshold returns. \n• Private banking and lending. Our private banking and \nlending activities include issuing loans to our wealth \nmanagement clients. Such loans are generally secured by \ncommercial and residential real estate, securities or other \nassets. We also raise deposits from wealth management \nclients, including through Marcus. Private banking and \nlending revenues include net interest income allocated to \ndeposits and net interest income earned on loans to \nindividual clients. \n• Equity investments.

The operating environment for \nPlatform Solutions is mainly impacted by the economic \nenvironment in the U.S., which, during 2024, was generally \ncharacterized by concerns about inflation (although some \nmeasures had begun to improve), a continued low rate of \nunemployment and a slight increase in the pace of growth in \nconsumer spending compared with 2023.\nIn the future, if economic conditions deteriorate, it may lead \nto a decrease in consumer spending or a deterioration in \nconsumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit \nlosses in Platform Solutions would likely be negatively \nimpacted.\n2024 versus 2023. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were \n$2.43 billion for 2024, 2% higher than 2023.\nNotwithstanding our strategic decision to narrow the focus \non consumer-related activities, Consumer platforms net \nrevenues were slightly higher compared with 2023, reflecting \nhigher average credit card balances and higher average \ndeposit balances, largely offset by the impact of the planned \ntransition of the GM credit card program to another issuer. \nTransaction banking and other net revenues were lower, \nprimarily reflecting lower net revenues related to the seller \nfinancing loan portfolio that was sold during 2024. See \n“Regulatory and Other Matters — Other Matters — \nNarrowing our Focus on Consumer-Related Activities” for \nfurther information. \nProvision for credit losses was $1.54 billion for 2024, \ncompared with $1.14 billion for 2023. Provisions for 2024 \nreflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio \n(primarily driven by net charge-offs). The net provision for \n2023 reflected net provisions related to the credit card \nportfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs), partially \noffset by a net release related to the GreenSky loan portfolio \n(including a reserve reduction related to the transfer of the \nportfolio to held for sale).\nOperating expenses were $1.96 billion for 2024, 43% lower \nthan 2023, primarily due to the write-down of identifiable \nintangible assets related to GreenSky and an impairment of \ngoodwill related to Consumer platforms in the prior year \nperiod. Pre-tax loss was $1.08 billion for 2024, compared \nwith a pre-tax loss of $2.18 billion for 2023.\nGeographic Data \nSee Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a \nsummary of our total net revenues, pre-tax earnings and net \nearnings by geographic region.\nBalance Sheet and Funding Sources \nBalance Sheet Management \nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability to \nmanage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While \nour asset base changes due to client activity, market \nfluctuations and business opportunities, the size and \ncomposition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, \nincluding (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of \ncapital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other \nfactors. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — \nCapital Management” for information about our capital \nmanagement process. \nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, \nour total assets at quarter-end are generally not materially \ndifferent from those occurring within our reporting periods.\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to \nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have \nprocesses in place to dynamically manage our assets and \nliabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) \nsetting balance sheet targets, (iii) monitoring of key metrics \nand (iv) scenario analyses. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n83\nBalance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan \nthat combines our projected total assets and composition of \nassets with our expected funding sources over a three-year \ntime horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be \nadjusted in response to changing business needs or market \nconditions. The objectives of this planning process are: \n• To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into \naccount the general state of the financial markets and \nexpected business activity levels, as well as regulatory \nrequirements; \n• To allow Corporate Treasury to evaluate balance sheet \ntargets of our revenue-producing units and requests to \nchange such targets in the context of our overall balance \nsheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital \nlevels, and key metrics; and \n• To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to \nraise, based on our projected assets and contractual \nmaturities. \nCorporate Treasury and Risk, along with our revenue-\nproducing units, review current and prior period information \nand expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet \nplan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and \nliability size and composition, target utilization, risk and \nperformance measures, and capital usage. \nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance \nsheets by business, funding projections and projected key \nmetrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset \nLiability Committee. See “Risk Management — Overview \nand Structure of Risk Management” for an overview of our \nrisk management structure. \nSetting Balance Sheet Targets. We set balance sheet \ntargets with the aim of ensuring that our consolidated \nbalance sheet, as well as the balance sheets for our businesses \nremain within our risk appetite. The Firmwide Asset Liability \nCommittee has the responsibility to review and approve \nbalance sheet targets at least quarterly. Our balance sheet \ntargets are set at levels which are close to actual operating \nlevels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk \nappetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion \namong our revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and \nRisk. Requests for changes in targets are evaluated after \ngiving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. \nCompliance with targets is monitored by our revenue-\nproducing units, Corporate Treasury and Risk. \nMonitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet \nmetrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, \nincluding asset and liability size and composition, target \nutilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to \nbusinesses and review and analyze movements resulting from \nnew business activity, as well as market fluctuations. \nScenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, \nincluding as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \nReview (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well \nas our resolution and recovery planning. See “Capital \nManagement \nand \nRegulatory \nCapital \n— \nCapital \nManagement” for further information about these scenario \nanalyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time \nhorizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific \nassumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use \nthese analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term \nbalance sheet management strategy, including the level and \ncomposition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, \nthese analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining \nappropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of \nsituations, including a severely stressed environment. \nBalance Sheet Analysis and Metrics \nAs of December 2024, total assets in our consolidated balance \nsheets were $1.68 trillion, an increase of $34.38 billion from \nDecember 2023, reflecting increases in trading assets of \n$93.05 billion (primarily due to an increase in government \nobligations, reflecting the impact of our and our clients’ \nactivities), investments of $37.68 billion (primarily due to an \nincrease in U.S. government obligations accounted for as \navailable-for-sale) and loans of $12.84 billion (primarily \nreflecting our clients’ activities), partially offset by decreases \nin cash and cash equivalents of $59.49 billion (primarily \nreflecting our activity) and collateralized agreements of \n$48.52 billion (primarily reflecting our activity).

See Note 11 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements for further information about our \ncollateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We \nmay also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral \nfor securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. \nWe also use our own inventory and investments to cover \ntransactions in which we or our clients have sold securities \nthat have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less \nsensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured \nfunding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. \nNonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured \nfunding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity \nprofiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility \nand counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate \nour refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered \nmaturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured \nfunding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA. \nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for \nthe liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek \nlonger maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset \nclasses that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, \nespecially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, \nexcluding funding collateralized by liquid government and \nagency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one \nmonth or greater and is primarily executed through term \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during \ntimes of market stress include certain financial instruments in \nthe following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed \nloans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt \nsecurities, equity securities and emerging market securities. \nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized \nfinancings, such as secured loans and notes.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n87\nCapital Management and Regulatory Capital \nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in \nplace a comprehensive capital management policy that \nprovides a framework, defines objectives and establishes \nguidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level \nand composition of capital in both business-as-usual and \nstressed conditions. \nCapital Management \nWe determine the appropriate amount and composition of \nour capital by considering multiple factors, including our \ncurrent and future regulatory capital requirements, the results \nof our capital planning and stress testing process, the results \nof resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating \nagency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the \nbusiness environment and conditions in the financial \nmarkets. \nWe manage our capital requirements and the levels of our \ncapital usage principally by setting targets on our balance \nsheet and risk-weighted assets (RWAs), in each case at both \nthe firmwide and business levels. \nWe principally manage the level and composition of our \ncapital through issuances and repurchases of our common \nstock. \nWe may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and \nsubordinated debt or other forms of capital as business \nconditions \nwarrant. \nPrior \nto \nsuch \nredemptions \nor \nrepurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See \nNotes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for \nfurther information about our subordinated debt and \npreferred stock. \nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of \ncapital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given \na range of business environments, including stressed \nconditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify \nand measure material risks associated with our business \nactivities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk \nand liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. \nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital \nadequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we \nare appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our \nbusinesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital \nplanning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to \nensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a \nsevere stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is \nviewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy \nand is integrated into our overall risk management structure, \ngovernance and policy framework. \nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress \nscenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse \nscenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to \ncapture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide \nfurther information about our stress test processes and a \nsummary of the results on our website as described in \n“Business — Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this \nForm 10-K.    \nAs required by the FRB’s CCAR rules, we submit an annual \ncapital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB’s \nreview is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking \ncapital planning process that accounts for our unique risks \nand that permits continued operation during times of \neconomic and financial stress. \nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the \ncapital necessary to continue operating under the baseline \nand severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those \ndeveloped internally. This evaluation also takes into account \nour process for identifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital \nplanning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to \nmake capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and \nrepurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or \nother capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The \nFRB determines the SCB applicable to us based on its own \nannual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach \nis calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and \nminimum \nprojected \nCET1 \ncapital \nratios \nunder \nthe \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned \ncommon stock dividends for each of the fourth through \nseventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a \npercentage of RWAs. \nBased on our 2024 CCAR submission, the FRB increased our \nSCB from 5.5% to 6.2%, resulting in a Standardized CET1 \ncapital ratio requirement of 13.7% for the period from \nOctober 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. See “Share \nRepurchase Program” for further information about common \nstock \nrepurchases \nand \ndividends \nand \n“Consolidated \nRegulatory Capital” for further information about the G-SIB \nsurcharge.

As part of our comprehensive \ncapital management policy, we maintain a contingency \ncapital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a \nframework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or \nactual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, \nidentification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as \nmitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate \ncommunication procedures to follow during a crisis period, \nincluding internal dissemination of information, as well as \ntimely communication with external stakeholders. \nCapital Attribution. We assess the capital usage of each of \nour businesses based on our attributed equity framework. \nThis framework considers many factors, including our \ninternal assessment of risks as well as the regulatory capital \nrequirements related to our business activities.\nWe review and make any necessary adjustments to our \nattributed equity in January each year, to reflect, among \nother things, our most recent stress test results and changes to \nour regulatory capital requirements. On January 1, 2024, our \nallocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the \nallocation as of December 2023) as follows: attributed equity \nincreased by approximately $1.6 billion for Platform \nSolutions, \nwhile \nattributed \nequity \ndecreased \nby \napproximately $1.2 billion for Asset & Wealth Management \nand approximately $0.4 billion for Global Banking & \nMarkets. On January 1, 2025, our allocation of attributed \nequity changed (relative to the allocation as of December \n2024) \nas \nfollows: \nattributed \nequity \nincreased \nby \napproximately $0.4 billion for Global Banking & Markets, \nwhile attributed equity decreased by approximately $0.3 \nbillion for Asset & Wealth Management and approximately \n$0.1 billion for Platform Solutions. See “Results of \nOperations — Segment Assets and Operating Results — \nSegment Operating Results” for information about our \naverage quarterly attributed equity by segment.\nShare Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase \nprogram to help maintain the appropriate level of common \nequity. On an annual basis, we submit a Board of Directors \nof Group Inc. (Board) approved capital plan to the Federal \nReserve, which includes planned share repurchases for each \nquarter. The share repurchases are effected primarily through \nregular \nopen-market \npurchases \n(which \nmay \ninclude \nrepurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and \naccelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of \nwhich are determined primarily by our current and projected \ncapital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but \nwhich may also be influenced by general market conditions \nand the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common \nstock. \nIn 2023, the Board approved a share repurchase program \nauthorizing repurchases of up to $30 billion of our common \nstock. The program has no set expiration or termination \ndate. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related \nStockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity \nSecurities” in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K and Note 19 to \nthe consolidated financial statements for further information \nabout our share repurchase program, and see above for \ninformation about our capital planning and stress testing \nprocess.\nDuring 2024, we returned a total of $11.80 billion of capital \nto common shareholders, including $8.00 billion of common \nshare repurchases and $3.80  billion of common stock \ndividends. \nConsistent \nwith \nour \ncapital \nmanagement \nphilosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of \ncapital for our clients where returns are attractive and \ndistribute any excess capital to shareholders through \ndividends and share repurchases, while targeting a 50 to 100 \nbasis point buffer above our capital requirement. \nWe are subject to a one percent non-deductible federal excise \ntax (buyback tax) that is applicable to the fair market value \nof certain corporate share repurchases. The fair market value \nof share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair \nmarket value of any applicable stock issued during the \ncalendar year, including stock issued to employees. The \nbuyback tax did not have a material impact on our financial \ncondition, results of operations or cash flows for 2024. \nResolution Capital Models. In connection with our \nresolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution \nCapital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is \ndesigned to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank \nUSA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, \nGSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman \nSachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset \nManagement International) have access to sufficient loss-\nabsorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt \nand unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind \ndown following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance \nwith our preferred resolution strategy. \nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts \nframework, which is designed to provide the Board with \ninformation needed to make an informed decision on \nwhether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for \nGroup Inc. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n89\nRating Agency Guidelines \nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the \nobligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees \nsubstantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. \nGS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term \nissuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, \nGSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term \nissuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term \nbank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have \nassigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other \nsubsidiaries of Group Inc. \nThe level and composition of our capital are among the many \nfactors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each \nagency has its own definition of eligible capital and \nmethodology \nfor \nevaluating \ncapital \nadequacy, \nand \nassessments are generally based on a combination of factors \nrather than a single calculation. See “Risk Management — \nLiquidity Risk Management — Credit Ratings” for further \ninformation about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank \nUSA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI. \nConsolidated Regulatory Capital \nWe \nare \nsubject \nto \nconsolidated \nregulatory \ncapital \nrequirements which are calculated in accordance with the \nregulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the \nCapital Framework, we are an “Advanced approaches” \nbanking organization and have been designated as a G-SIB. In \nmanaging our capital, we consider a number of different \ncapital requirements, the most binding of which can vary \nover time. \nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital \nFramework \ninclude \nthe \ncapital \nconservation \nbuffer \nrequirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under \nthe Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the \nStandardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer \n(under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge (under \nboth Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge is 3.0% for both \n2024 and 2025 and is expected to be 3.5% beginning in 2026. \nThe G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the \nfuture may differ due to additional guidance from our \nregulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB can \nchange significantly from year to year based on the results of \nthe annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain \ncapital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a \nbuffer of 50 to 100 basis points. \nSee Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for \nfurther information about our risk-based capital ratios and \nleverage ratios, and the Capital Framework. \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) \nWe are also subject to the FRB’s TLAC and related \nrequirements.

For \nfurther information about our risk management processes, \nsee “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” and for \ninformation about our areas of risk, see “Liquidity Risk \nManagement,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk \nManagement,” \n“Operational \nRisk \nManagement,” \n“Cybersecurity \nRisk \nManagement,” \n“Model \nRisk \nManagement” and “Other Risk Management,” as well as \n“Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nOverview and Structure of Risk Management \nOverview \nEffective risk management is critical to our success. \nAccordingly, we have established an enterprise risk \nmanagement framework that employs a comprehensive, \nintegrated approach to risk management and is designed to \nenable comprehensive risk management processes through \nwhich we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we \nassume in conducting our activities. Our risk management \nstructure is built around three core components: governance, \nprocesses and people. \nGovernance. Risk management governance starts with the \nBoard, which both directly and through its committees, \nincluding its Risk Committee, oversees our approach to \nmanaging our risks through the enterprise risk management \nframework. The Board is also responsible for the annual \nreview and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk \nappetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we \nare willing to accept or to avoid in order to achieve our \nobjectives included in our strategy and business plan, while \nremaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The \nBoard reviews our strategy and business plan and is \nultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction \nabout our strategy and risk appetite. \nThe Board, including through its committees, receives regular \nbriefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market \nrisk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and climate risk, \nfrom our chief risk officer, on cybersecurity threats and risks \nfrom our chief information security officer (CISO), on \ncompliance risk and conduct risk from our chief compliance \nofficer, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from our \nchief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our \nreputation from the chair and/or vice-chairs of our Firmwide \nReputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports \nto our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of \nthe Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk \nportfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk \nCommittee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material \nexposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in \nour risk appetite statement. \nEnterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, is \nresponsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management \nframework provides the Board, our risk committees and \nsenior management with a consistent and integrated \napproach to managing our various risks in a manner \nconsistent with our risk appetite. \nOur first line of defense consists of our revenue-producing \nunits, \nConflicts \nResolution, \nControllers, \nEngineering, \nCorporate Treasury and certain other corporate functions. \nThe first line of defense is responsible for its risk-generating \nactivities, as well as for the design and execution of controls \nto mitigate such risks. \nOur Risk and Compliance functions are considered our \nsecond line of defense and provide independent assessment, \noversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of \ndefense, as well as lead and participate in firmwide risk \ncommittees.  \nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our \ndirector of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of \nthe Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. \nInternal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of \naudit and industry experience, including risk management \nexpertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently \nassessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, \nincluding those within the risk management framework, and \nproviding timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the \nBoard, senior management and regulators. \nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the \naccountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework \nfor effective challenge by the second line and empowers \nindependent review from the third line. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n95\nProcesses. We maintain various processes that are critical \ncomponents of our risk management framework, including \n(i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limits, \nthresholds and alerts, (iii) control monitoring and testing, \nand (iv) risk reporting. \n• Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe the \nidentification and assessment of our risks is a critical step \nin \nproviding \nour \nBoard \nand \nsenior \nmanagement \ntransparency and insight into the range and materiality of \nour risks. We have a comprehensive data collection \nprocess, including firmwide policies and procedures that \nrequire all employees to report and escalate risk events. \nOur approach for risk identification and assessment is \ncomprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and \nforward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk \nprofile and business environment, leverages subject matter \nexpertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical \nrisks. We perform risk assessments periodically with the \naim of ensuring that our material financial and \nnonfinancial risks are mitigated through controls to an \nacceptable tolerance level in accordance with our risk \nappetite. Our risk assessments include, among other things, \nthe use of stress testing as well as an assessment of our \ninternal control processes designed to mitigate such risks.\nFirmwide stress testing is an important part of our risk \nmanagement process. It allows us to quantify our exposure \nto tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, \nundertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our \nrisk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a \nregular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive \nanalysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks \ncombining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but \nnot limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, \noperational and compliance, strategic, systemic and \nemerging risks into our stress scenarios. We also perform \nad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or \nconditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital \nadequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing \nprocess. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital \n— Capital Management” for further information. \nWe maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all \nof our inventory to current market levels. We carry our \ninventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected \nimmediately in our risk management systems and in net \nrevenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one \nof the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk \nand that it provides transparent and realistic insight into \nour inventory exposures. \n• Risk Appetite, Limits, Thresholds and Alerts. We \napply risk limits, thresholds and alerts to control and \nmonitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and \nmarkets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk \nCommittee, approves limits, thresholds and alerts included \nin our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and \nproduct levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Appetite \nCommittee, \nthrough \ndelegated \nauthority \nfrom \nthe \nFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for \napproving our risk limits, thresholds and alerts policy, \nsubject to the overall limits directly or indirectly approved \nby the Board, and monitoring these limits. \nThe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for \napproving and monitoring limits at firmwide, business and \nproduct levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will \nrequire periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that \nreflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing \ndialogue about risk among our first and second lines of \ndefense, committees and senior management, as well as \nrapid escalation of risk-related matters. The Firmwide Risk \nAppetite Committee also authorizes Risk to set limits and \nthresholds to support monitoring and oversight at a more \ngranular level. For example, Market Risk sets limits at \ncertain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits \nfor individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, \nindustries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and \namended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect \nchanges to our strategic business plan, as well as changing \nmarket conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. \nRisks limits are monitored by the respective Risk functions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n96\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n• Control Monitoring and Testing. We perform control \nmonitoring and testing to measure the effectiveness of our \nkey controls and to ensure that we are in compliance with \npolicies, codes of conduct, control standards and \nregulatory requirements. Monitoring and testing is \nperformed by dedicated teams within the first and second \nlines of defense. These teams establish procedures, develop \nrisk-based annual plans, perform control testing and \nescalate identified issues.\nIssues identified by the dedicated teams, as well as self-\nidentified issues by our employees, are assessed for \nappropriate escalation and resolution. Where material or \nthematic issues exist, we develop a plan to remediate them, \nas appropriate, and monitor the remediation activities.  \n• Risk Reporting. Effective risk reporting depends on our \nability to get the right information to the right people at the \nright time. Risk reporting is designed to be both forward- \nand backward-looking and consider detailed information \non existing and emerging risk exposures. Risk reporting \nmay \ninclude \nstress \ntesting \nand \nscenario \nanalysis, \ninformation about the risk profiles for financial and \nnonfinancial risks, utilization of risk limits and thresholds, \ndetails of new and emerging risks identified through our \nrisk identification processes, details of issues, significant \ninternal and external events, and information related to the \neffectiveness of our controls and remediation plans. As \nsuch, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk \nsystems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk \nmanagement technology systems provide us with complete, \naccurate and timely information. Our risk reporting \nprocess is designed to take into account information about \nboth existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk \ncommittees and senior management to perform their \nresponsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into \nrisk exposures.\nWe make extensive use of risk committees and councils \nthat meet regularly and serve as an important means to \nfacilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and \nmitigate risks. \nWe maintain strong and proactive communication about \nrisk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-\nmaking among our first and second lines of defense, \ncommittees and senior management. While our first line of \ndefense is accountable and responsible for management of \ntheir risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second \nline of defense in order to reinforce the importance of \nhaving effective oversight and challenge, and a strong \nculture of escalation and accountability across all \nfunctions. \nPeople. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for \nhelping to make informed decisions in real time about the \nrisks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management \nrequires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing \nand timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The \nexperience of our professionals, and their understanding of \nthe nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in \nassessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent \nlevels.\nWe reinforce a culture of effective risk management, \nconsistent with our risk appetite, in our training and \ndevelopment programs, as well as in the way we evaluate \nperformance, and recognize and reward our people. Our \ntraining and development programs, including certain \nsessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the \nimportance of risk management, client relationships and \nreputational excellence. As part of our performance review \nprocess, we assess reputational excellence, including how an \nemployee exercises good risk management and reputational \njudgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and \ncompliance policies. Our review and reward processes are \ndesigned to communicate and reinforce to our professionals \nthe link between behavior and how people are recognized, \nthe need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the \nneed to always act in accordance with our highest standards. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n97\nStructure \nUltimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. \nThe Board oversees risk both directly and through its \ncommittees, including its Risk Committee. We also have a \nseries of committees that generally consist of senior \nmanagers, including from both our first and second lines of \ndefense, with specific risk management mandates that have \noversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk \nmanagement activities. We have an established policy for \nthese committees so that appropriate information barriers are \nin place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also \nhave additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, \nare described below. In addition to these committees, we \nhave other risk committees that provide oversight for \ndifferent businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. \nAll of our committees have responsibility for considering the \nimpact on our reputation of the transactions and activities \nthat they oversee. \nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and \nupdated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the \ncommittee members. Accordingly, the length of time that \nmembers serve on the respective committees varies as \ndetermined by the committee chairs and based on the \nresponsibilities of the members. \nThe chart below presents an overview of our risk \nmanagement governance structure. \nManagement Committee. The Management Committee \noversees our global activities. It provides this oversight \ndirectly and through delegated authority. This committee \nconsists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our \nchief executive officer. Most members of the Management \nCommittee are also members of other committees. The \nfollowing are the committees that are principally involved in \nfirmwide risk management. \nFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The Firmwide \nEnterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of \nour financial and nonfinancial risks. As part of such \noversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing \nreview, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk \nmanagement framework, as well as our risk limits, and \nthresholds and alerts policy, through delegated authority to \nthe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. The Firmwide \nEnterprise Risk Committee also reviews new significant \nstrategic business initiatives to determine whether they are \nconsistent with our risk appetite and risk management \ncapabilities. Additionally, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk \nCommittee performs enhanced reviews of significant risk \nevents, the top residual and emerging risks, and the overall \nrisk and control environment in each of our business units in \norder to propose uplifts, identify elements that are common \nto all business units and analyze the consolidated residual \nrisks that we face.

This committee has \noversight responsibility for asset liability management, \nincluding interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer \npricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. \nThis committee makes recommendations as to any \nadjustments to asset liability management and financial \nresource allocation in light of current events, risks, \nexposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related \npolicies. This committee is co-chaired by our chief financial \nofficer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs \nby our chief executive officer, and reports to the \nManagement Committee. \nLiquidity Risk Management \nOverview \nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund \nourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-\nspecific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. \nWe have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of \nliquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be \nable to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to \ncontinue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under \nadverse circumstances. \nCorporate Treasury is responsible for our liquidity, including \ndeveloping and executing our liquidity and funding strategy. \nLiquidity Risk, which is part of our second line of defense \nand reports to our chief risk officer, has primary \nresponsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our \nliquidity risk by providing independent firmwide oversight \nand challenge across our global businesses. Liquidity Risk is \nalso responsible for the establishment of stress testing and \nlimits frameworks. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n99\nLiquidity Risk Management Principles \nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) \nhold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover \noutflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate \nAsset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable \nContingency Funding Plan. \nGCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad \nrange of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a \nstressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-\nfund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during \na liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of \nunencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe \nthat the securities held in our GCLA would be readily \nconvertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, \nby entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of \nresale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet \nimmediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or \ndepend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets. \nOur GCLA reflects the following principles: \n• The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most \ncritical to a company’s survival; \n• Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and \ncollateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. \nOur businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are \ndetermined by many factors, including market movements, \ncollateral requirements and client commitments, all of \nwhich can change dramatically in a difficult funding \nenvironment; \n• During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including \nunsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured \nfinancing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms \n(e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or \navailability of other types of secured financing may change \nand certain deposits may be withdrawn; and \n• As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we \nestimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more \nunencumbered securities and have larger funding balances \nthan our businesses would otherwise require. We believe \nthat our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly \nliquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases \nour total assets and our funding costs. \nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs \nFunding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.’s major broker-\ndealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents \nwith the goal of providing us with sufficient operating \nliquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, \neven in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the \nGCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of \nour other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, \nentities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate \naccess to parent company liquidity. \nAsset-Liability \nManagement. \nOur \nliquidity \nrisk \nmanagement policies are designed to ensure we have a \nsufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets \nexperience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and \ndiversity of our funding across markets, products and \ncounterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding \nprofile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration \nthe characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. \nOur approach to asset-liability management includes: \n• Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our \nfunding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, \ndiversified sources of funding in excess of our current \nrequirements. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources — \nFunding Sources” for further information; \n• Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with \nparticular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability \nto fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding \nrequirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed \nenvironment while appropriately managing risk. This \nenables us to determine the most appropriate funding \nproducts and tenors. See “Balance Sheet and Funding \nSources — Balance Sheet Management” for further \ninformation about our balance sheet management process \nand “— Funding Sources — Secured Funding” for further \ninformation about asset classes that may be harder to fund \non a secured basis; and \n• Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long \ntenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This \nreduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in \nadvance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of \nour assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance \nsheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be \nmaterially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. \nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to \nfund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent \nobligations in normal times, as well as during periods of \nmarket stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet \nmanagement process, we use actual and projected asset \nbalances to determine secured and unsecured funding \nrequirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by \nthe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, Risk \nand the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee review our total \nunsecured long-term borrowings and total shareholders’ \nequity to help ensure that we maintain a level of long-term \nfunding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing \nrequirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would begin by \nliquidating and monetizing our GCLA before selling other \nassets. However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be \nprudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.  \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n100\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nSubsidiary Funding Policies \nThe majority of our unsecured borrowings is raised by Group \nInc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and \nother subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their \nasset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In \naddition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with \nthe necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. \nThe benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are \nenhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding \nrequirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the \nsubsidiary level through a variety of products, including \ndeposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. \nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary’s \nfunds or securities are not freely available to its parent, \nFunding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided \nfor and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other \nrestrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are \nsubject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or \nreduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group \nInc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could \nimpede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make \npayments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the \ncapital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available \nto Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing \nprovided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to \nGroup Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such \nfinancing. \nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and \nsubordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its \nregulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2024, \nGroup Inc. had $38.69  billion of equity and subordinated \nindebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. \nregistered broker-dealer; $47.21  billion invested in GSI, a \nregulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.08  billion invested in \nGSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $62.81  billion \ninvested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-\nchartered bank; and $5.30  billion invested in GSIB, a \nregulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, \ndirectly or indirectly, in the form of: $131.82  billion of \nunsubordinated \nloans \n(including \nsecured \nloans \nof \n$59.97  billion) and $32.92  billion of collateral and cash \ndeposits to these entities as of December 2024. In addition, as \nof December 2024, Group Inc. had significant amounts of \ncapital invested in and loans to its other regulated \nsubsidiaries. \nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency \nfunding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and \nresponding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market \nstress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of \npotential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are \nreviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the \nseverity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or \nmarket dislocation. The contingency funding plan also \ndescribes in detail our potential responses if our assessments \nindicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include \npre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash \nand collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of \nliquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks \nwhich may arise are also described and assigned to \nindividuals responsible for execution. \nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of \nindividuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering \neffective \ncoordination, \ncontrol \nand \ndistribution \nof \ninformation, implementing liquidity maintenance activities \nand managing internal and external communication, all of \nwhich are critical in the management of a crisis or period of \nmarket stress. \nStress Tests \nIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we \nmodel liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time \nhorizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, \nreferred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our \nliquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider \nother factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of \nour potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional \ninternal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday \nLiquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing \nmodels, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable \nregulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our \ncondition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the \nModeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, \nthe long-term stress testing models and the resolution \nliquidity models are reported to senior management on a \nregular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See \n“Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for \ninformation about firmwide stress tests. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n101\nModeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity \nOutflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that \ninclude combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. \nThese scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative \nelements: \n• Severely challenged market environments, which include \nlow consumer and corporate confidence, financial and \npolitical instability, and adverse changes in market values, \nincluding potential declines in equity markets and widening \nof credit spreads; and \n• A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material \nlosses, reputational damage (including, as a result of, the \ndissemination of negative information through social \nmedia), litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. \nThe following are key modeling elements of our Modeled \nLiquidity Outflow: \n• Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario; \n• A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured \ncredit ratings; \n• Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our \naccess to unsecured and secured funding; \n• No support from additional government funding facilities. \nAlthough we have access to various central bank funding \nprograms, we do not assume reliance on additional sources \nof funding in a liquidity crisis; and \n• A combination of contractual outflows and contingent \noutflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet \narrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other \nthings, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term \ndeposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, \namong other things, the withdrawal of customer credit \nbalances in our prime brokerage business, increase in \nvariation margin requirements due to adverse changes in \nthe value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared \nderivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and \nwithdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. \nSee notes to the consolidated financial statements for \nfurther information about contractual outflows, including \nNote 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, \nNote 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 \nfor operating lease payments, and “Off-Balance Sheet \nArrangements” for further information about our various \ntypes of off-balance sheet arrangements. \nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model \nmeasures our intraday liquidity needs in a scenario where \naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may become \nconstrained. The intraday liquidity model considers a variety \nof factors, including historical settlement activity. \nLong-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress \ntests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through \nprolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe \nliquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues \nto be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative \nasset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period \nof potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding \nprofile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration \nthe characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our \nresolution planning efforts, we have established our \nResolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, \nwhich estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a \nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using \nour Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include \ncertain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need \nframework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major \nsubsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a Group \nInc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred \nresolution strategy. \nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts \nframework, which is designed to provide the Board with \ninformation needed to make an informed decision on \nwhether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for \nGroup Inc. \nLimits \nWe use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across \nliquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity \nexposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels \nof risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See “Overview and \nStructure of Risk Management” for information about the \nlimit approval process. \nLimits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Liquidity \nRisk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and \nescalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk \ncommittee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have \nbeen exceeded. \nGCLA and Unencumbered Metrics \nGCLA. Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk \nmodels, described above, as well as our consideration of \nother factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative \nassessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, \nwe believe our liquidity position as of both December 2024 \nand December 2023 was appropriate. We strictly limit our \nGCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash \nbecause they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding \nenvironment. We do not include other potential sources of \nexcess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid \nunencumbered securities or committed credit facilities. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our Modeled Liquidity \nOutflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a \nrequirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone \nrequirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank \nsubsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the \nnecessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course \nof business, and is also obligated to provide capital and \nliquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our \nmaterial financial distress or failure.

The LCR rule requires organizations to \nmaintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid \nassets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, \nshort-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes \nHQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum \nrequirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are \nrequired to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n104\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the \ncredit rating agencies’ assessment of: \n• Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk \nmanagement practices;\n• Our level and variability of earnings;\n• Our capital base; \n• Our franchise, reputation and management; \n• Our corporate governance; and \n• The external operating and economic environment, \nincluding, in some cases, the assumed level of government \nsupport or other systemic considerations, such as potential \nresolution. \nCertain of our derivatives have been transacted under \nbilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us \nto post collateral or terminate the transactions based on \nchanges in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to \nensure we would, among other potential requirements, be \nable to make the additional collateral or termination \npayments that may be required in the event of a two-notch \nreduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral \nthat has not been called by counterparties, but is available to \nthem. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for \nfurther information about derivatives with credit-related \ncontingent features and the additional collateral or \ntermination payments related to our net derivative liabilities \nunder bilateral agreements that could have been called by \ncounterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade \nin our credit ratings. \nCash Flows \nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex \nand bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. \nConsequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis \nis less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the \nliquidity and asset-liability management policies described \nabove. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in \nhighlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in \nour businesses. \nYear Ended December 2024. Our cash and cash \nequivalents decreased by $59.49 billion to $182.09 billion at \nthe end of 2024, primarily due to net cash used for investing \nactivities and operating activities, partially offset by financing \nactivities. The net cash used for investing activities primarily \nreflected net purchases of U.S. government obligations \naccounted for as available-for-sale securities and an increase \nin net lending activities (reflecting increases in other \ncollateralized loans). The net cash used for operating \nactivities primarily reflected cash outflows from trading \nassets, partially offset by cash inflows from collateralized \ntransactions (reflecting both an increase in collateralized \nfinancings and a decrease in collateralized agreements). The \nnet cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected \ncash inflows from other secured financings and deposits \n(reflecting increases in consumer deposits, partially offset by \ndecreases in transaction banking deposits and other deposits), \npartially offset by common stock repurchases and net \nrepayments of unsecured long-term borrowings. \nYear Ended December 2023.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n105\nMarket Risk Management \nOverview \nMarket risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings \ndue to changes in market conditions. Our assets and \nliabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include \npositions held for market making for our clients and for our \ninvesting and financing activities, and these positions change \nbased on client demands and our investment opportunities. \nWe employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the \nrespective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories \nof market risk include the following: \n• Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the \nlevel, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of \ninterest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;\n• Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in \nprices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of \nequities and equity indices; \n• Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in \nspot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency \nrates; and \n• Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in \nspot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, \nsuch as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, \nelectricity, and precious and base metals. \nMarket Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and \nreports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for \nassessing, monitoring and managing our market risk by \nproviding independent firmwide oversight and challenge \nacross our global businesses. \nManagers in revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury \nand Market Risk discuss market information, positions and \nestimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in \nrevenue-producing units and Corporate Treasury are \naccountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. \nThese managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, \nmarkets and the instruments available to hedge their \nexposures. \nMarket Risk Management Process \nOur process for managing market risk includes the critical \ncomponents of our risk management framework described in \nthe “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well \nas the following: \n• Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits \nand reporting our exposures; \n• Diversifying exposures; \n• Controlling position sizes; and \n• Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related \nsecurities or derivatives. \nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform \nan independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR), Earnings-\nat-Risk (EaR) and other stress measures, capture risk \nmeasures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures \nto individual risk factors of each position, report many \ndifferent views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, \nproduct type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a \ntimely manner. \nRisk Measures \nWe produce risk measures and monitor them against \nestablished market risk limits. These measures reflect an \nextensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at \nproduct, business and firmwide levels. \nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of \npotential losses for small, moderate and more extreme \nmarket moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. \nOur primary risk measures are VaR, EaR and other stress \ntests. \nOur risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each \ndesk and business, and are distributed daily to senior \nmanagement of both our revenue-producing units and Risk. \nValue-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to \nadverse market movements over a defined time horizon with \na specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included \nin VaR, see “Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk \nMeasures.” We typically employ a one-day time horizon with \na 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which \ncaptures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity \nprices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR \nfacilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk \ncharacteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of \naggregated risk at the firmwide level. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n106\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and \ntherefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk \nmanagement process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: \n• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time \nhorizons where moves may be extreme; \n• VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of \ndifferent risk positions; and \n• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce \naccurate predictions of all future market moves. \nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks \nin our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with \nfull valuation of market factors at the position level by \nsimultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that \nposition. These market factors include spot prices, credit \nspreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and \ncorrelation, and are updated periodically based on changes in \nthe composition of positions, as well as variations in market \nconditions. We sample from five years of historical data to \ngenerate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical \ndata is weighted so that the relative importance of the data \nreduces over time. This gives greater importance to more \nrecent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, \nwhich improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential \nloss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were \nunchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market \nvolatility and vice versa. \nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in \nestimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no \nsudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. \nOur VaR measure does not include: \n• Positions that are not accounted for at fair value, such as \nheld-to-maturity securities and loans, deposits and \nunsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized \ncost;\n• Available-for-sale \nsecurities \nfor \nwhich \nthe \nrelated \nunrealized fair value gains and losses are included in \naccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss);\n• Positions that are best measured and monitored using \nsensitivity measures; and \n• The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit \nspreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit \nspreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value \noption was elected. \nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., \ncomparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR \nto the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at \nthe firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major \nregulated subsidiaries. \nEarnings-at-Risk. We manage our interest rate risk using \nthe EaR metric. EaR measures the estimated impact of \nchanges in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred \nstock dividends over a defined time horizon. EaR \ncomplements the VaR metric, which measures the impact of \ninterest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the \nfair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market \nchanges). Our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a \nvariety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n• Differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, \nliabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet \ninstruments.\n• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred \nstock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the \nsame maturity or repricing dates. \n• Certain interest rate sensitive fees.\nCorporate Treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk \nfrom all businesses using both cash and derivatives \ninstruments, \nincluding \navailable-for-sale \nand \nheld-to-\nmaturity securities and interest rate derivatives. We measure \nEaR over a one-year time horizon following a 100- and 200-\nbasis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and \nlong-term interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated relative \nto a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, \namong other things, the market’s expectation of forward \nrates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. \nThese scenarios include contractual elements of assets, \nliabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet \ninstruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment \nschedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate \nceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our \nbalance sheet size and composition, prepayment behavior \nand deposit repricing. Deposit repricing is captured by \nevaluating the change in deposit rate paid relative to the \nchange in market rates (deposit beta) and we calibrate the \ndeposit betas used in our models by using a number of \nfactors, including observed historical behavior, future \nexpectations, funding needs and the competitive landscape. \nWe continuously monitor the performance of our key \nassumptions against observed behavior and regularly review \ntheir sensitivity on our risk metrics. \nWe manage EaR with a goal to reduce potential volatility \nresulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within \nour EaR risk appetite. Our EaR scenario is regularly \nevaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our \nbusiness plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic \nfactors. While management uses the best information \navailable to estimate EaR, actual results may differ materially \nas a result of, among other things, changes in the economic \nenvironment or assumptions used in the process. We also \nmeasure the sensitivity of the economic value of our equity \n(EVE) to changes in interest rates. Compared to EaR, EVE \nprovides a longer-term measurement of the interest rate risk \nexposure, primarily on non-trading assets and liabilities, by \ncapturing the net impact of changes in interest rates to the \npresent value of their cash flows. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n107\nCorporate Treasury is responsible for our aggregated interest \nrate risk, including assessing and monitoring EaR and EVE \nsensitivity, and interest rate risk stress tests and assumptions. \nRisk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports \nto our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for \nassessing, monitoring and managing our interest rate risk \n(including \nEaR \nand \nEVE \nsensitivity) \nby \nproviding \nindependent firmwide oversight and challenge across our \nglobal businesses. \nStress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining the \neffect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress \ntests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the \npotential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a \nvariety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential \nloss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, \nincluding firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and \nscenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are \nanalyzed together for risk management purposes. See \n“Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for \ninformation about firmwide stress tests. \nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market \nmove in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity \nprices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market \nshocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a \none-day time horizon up to those that could take many \nmonths to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify \nthe impact of the default of any single entity, which captures \nthe risk of large or concentrated exposures. \nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified \nevent, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors \nsimultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we \ncalculate potential direct exposure associated with our \nsovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity \nand currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign \npositions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. \nWhen conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a \nnumber of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from \nmoderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, \nthese stress tests are constructed using both historical events \nand forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. \nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability \nbecause they are calculated at a specified confidence level, \nthere may not be an implied probability that our stress testing \nscenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model \nboth moderate and more extreme moves in underlying \nmarket factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally \nassume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged \n(although experience demonstrates that we are generally able \nto do so). \nLimits \nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size \nof our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR, \nEaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. \nSee “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nLimits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Risk. Risk \nis responsible for identifying and escalating to senior \nmanagement and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a \ntimely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., \ndue to positional changes or changes in market conditions, \nsuch as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such \ninstances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we \nhold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if \nwarranted. \nMetrics \nWe analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more \ndetailed levels, including by risk category, business and \nregion. Diversification effect in the tables below represents \nthe difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for \nthe four risk categories. This effect arises because the four \nmarket risk categories are not perfectly correlated. \nSubstantially all positions in VaR are included within Global \nBanking & Markets.\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nCategories\nInterest rates\n$ \n81 $ \n96 \nEquity prices"

Our exposure to \ncredit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC \nderivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk \nalso comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing \ntransactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and \nsecurities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and \nother receivables. \nCredit Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and \nreports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for \nassessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk by \nproviding independent firmwide oversight and challenge \nacross our global businesses. In addition, we hold other \npositions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and \nsecondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a \ncomponent of market risk measures, which are monitored \nand managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives \nto manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give \nrise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit \nRisk. \nCredit Risk Management Process \nOur process for managing credit risk includes the critical \ncomponents of our risk management framework described in \nthe “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well \nas the following: \n• Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits \nand \nreporting \nour \ncredit \nexposures \nand \ncredit \nconcentrations; \n• Establishing or approving underwriting standards; \n• Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on \nits payment obligations; \n• Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and \nlosses resulting from a counterparty default; \n• Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and \nhedging; and \n• Maximizing recovery through active workout and \nrestructuring of claims. \nWe also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial \nand ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a \ncounterparty \nto \nmeet \nits \nfinancial \nobligations. \nFor \nsubstantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our \nprocess is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more \nfrequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or \nchanges in circumstances. We determine an internal credit \nrating for the counterparty by considering the results of the \ncredit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature \nof and outlook for the counterparty’s industry and the \neconomic environment. For collateralized loans, we also take \ninto consideration collateral received or other credit support \narrangements when determining an internal credit rating. \nSenior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect \nand approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. \nOur risk assessment process may also include, where \napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not \nlimited to, delinquency status, collateral value, FICO credit \nscores and other risk factors. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n111\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure \nto individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to \ncounterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also \nprovide management with comprehensive information about \nour aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, \nindustry, country and region. \nRisk Measures \nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the \nevent of non-payment by a counterparty using current and \npotential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing \ntransactions, current exposure represents the amount \npresently owed to us after taking into account applicable \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure \nrepresents our estimate of the future exposure that could \narise over the life of a transaction based on market \nmovements within a specified confidence level. Potential \nexposure also takes into account netting and collateral \narrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the \nprimary measure is a function of the notional amount of the \nposition. \nStress Tests \nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit \nexposures, including potential concentrations that would \nresult from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or \ncredit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity \nprices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and \nmore extreme market movements, including shocks to \nmultiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a \nsevere market or economic event. In the case of sovereign \ndefault, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our \nsovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures \narising from potential market moves in response to the \ndefault, and the impact of credit market deterioration on \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from \nthe sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is \ncalculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing \ndoes not generally assume a probability of these events \noccurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See \n“Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for \ninformation about firmwide stress tests. \nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, \nwe also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in \nresponse to specific events that we deem significant. We also \nutilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of \ncertain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as \nthe impact of credit market deterioration on corporate \nborrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the \nrisk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks \nvary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We \nreview estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order \nto understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss \nconcentrations, and assess and seek to mitigate our \nexposures, where necessary. \nLimits \nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as \nunderwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our \ncredit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are \nbased on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for \nregular monitoring, review, escalation and management of \ncredit risk concentrations. See “Overview and Structure of \nRisk Management” for information about the limit approval \nprocess. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and \nidentifying and escalating to senior management and/or the \nappropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances \nwhere limits have been exceeded. \nRisk Mitigants \nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities \nfinancing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements \nwith counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and \npayables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit \nrisk with counterparties by entering into agreements that \nenable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or \ncontingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the \ncounterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified level. We \nmonitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our \ncredit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to \nminimize exposures where there is a significant positive \ncorrelation \nbetween \nthe \ncreditworthiness \nof \nour \ncounterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. \nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit \nquality of the borrower and other characteristics of the \ntransaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. \nRisk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, \ncovenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, \nfor certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, \nstructure and other terms as market conditions change. The \ntype and structure of risk mitigants employed can \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a \nloan or lending commitment. \nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a \ncounterparty’s financial strength or when we believe a \ncounterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain \nthird-party guarantees of the counterparty’s obligations. We \nmay also seek to mitigate our credit risk using credit \nderivatives or participation agreements.  \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n112\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nCredit Exposures \nAs of December 2024, our aggregate credit exposure \ndecreased slightly compared with December 2023, primarily \nreflecting a decrease in cash deposits with central banks, \npartially offset by an increase in loans and lending \ncommitments. The percentage of our credit exposures arising \nfrom non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our \ninternally determined public rating agency equivalents) \nincreased compared with December 2023, primarily reflecting \na decrease in investment-grade credit exposure related to cash \ndeposits with central banks. Our credit exposures are \ndescribed further below. \nCash and Cash Equivalents. Our credit exposure on cash \nand cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and \nincludes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing \ndeposits. We seek to mitigate the risk of credit loss, by \nplacing substantially all of our deposits with highly rated \nbanks and central banks. \nThe table below presents our credit exposure from \nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration \nby industry, region and internally determined public rating \nagency equivalents. \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n $167,253  $224,493 \nIndustry\nFinancial Institutions\n 10% \n 9% \nSovereign\n 90% \n 91% \nTotal\n 100% \n 100% \nRegion\nAmericas\n 67% \n 50% \nEMEA\n 24% \n 34% \nAsia\n 9% \n 16% \nTotal\n 100% \n 100% \nCredit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent)\nAAA\n 79% \n 65% \nAA\n 6% \n 15% \nA\n 14% \n 20% \nBBB\n 1%  \n– \nTotal\n 100% \n 100% \nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and \nother purposes of $14.84  billion as of December 2024 and \n$17.08 billion as of December 2023. \nOTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives \narises primarily from our market-making activities. As a \nmarket maker, we enter into derivative transactions to \nprovide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and \nhedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to \nmanage market risk exposures. We manage our credit \nexposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, \nmeasures, limits and risk mitigants described above. \nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under \nbilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily \nexchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential \ncomponent of fair value, we include a credit valuation \nadjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect \ncounterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the \nconsolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the \npresent value of expected exposure, the probability of \ncounterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default. \nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC \nderivatives and the concentration by industry and region. \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nOTC derivative assets"

Credit exposure represents the potential for \nloss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a \ncounterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the \npotential for loss in value of our long and short positions due \nto changes in market prices. \nCountry Exposures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has \nnegatively affected the global economy and increased \nmacroeconomic uncertainty. Our total credit exposure to \nUkrainian counterparties or borrowers was not material as of \nDecember 2024. Our total market exposure to Ukrainian \nissuers as of December 2024 was $126 million, primarily to \nsovereign issuers. Such exposure consisted of $134 million \nrelated to debt and $(8) million related to credit derivatives. \nOur credit exposure to Russian counterparties or borrowers \nand our market exposure to Russian issuers were not \nmaterial as of December 2024. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, \nItem 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about our \nrisks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nIn addition, economic and/or political uncertainties in \nEthiopia, Lebanon and Venezuela have led to concerns about \ntheir financial stability. Our credit exposure to counterparties \nor borrowers and our market exposure to issuers relating to \neach of these countries was not material as of December \n2024. \nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure \nand assess our country exposures and to determine our risk \nappetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of \nthe counterparty, issuer’s assets, where they generate revenue, \nthe country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction \nwhere a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the \ngovernment whose policies affect their ability to repay their \nobligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific \ncountry both at the individual counterparty level, as well as \nat the aggregate country level. See “Stress Tests” for \ninformation about stress tests that are designed to estimate \nthe direct and indirect impact of events involving the above \ncountries. \nOperational Risk Management \nOverview \nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting \nfrom inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems \nor from external events. Our exposure to operational risk \narises \nfrom \nroutine \nprocessing \nerrors, \nas \nwell \nas \nextraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or \nlegal and regulatory matters, that could occur for us or our \nthird-party vendors. \nPotential types of loss events related to internal and external \noperational risk include: \n• Execution, delivery and process management; \n• Business disruption and system failures; \n• Employment practices and workplace safety; \n• Clients, products and business practices; \n• Third-party risk, including vendor risk;\n• Damage to physical assets; \n• Internal fraud; and \n• External fraud. \nOperational Risk, which is part of our second line of defense \nand reports to our chief risk officer, has primary \nresponsibility for developing and implementing a formalized \nframework \nfor \nassessing, \nmonitoring \nand \nmanaging \noperational risk to support firmwide oversight and challenge \nof our global businesses, with the goal of maintaining our \nexposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk \nappetite. \nOperational Risk Management Process \nOur process for managing operational risk includes the \ncritical components of our risk management framework \ndescribed in the “Overview and Structure of Risk \nManagement,” including a comprehensive data collection \nprocess, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for \noperational risk events. \nWe combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage \nand measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, \nour senior management assesses firmwide and business-level \noperational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our \nfirst and second lines of defense are responsible for risk \nidentification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, \nincluding escalating operational risks and risk events to \nsenior management. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n120\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nWe seek to maintain a comprehensive control framework \ndesigned to provide a well-controlled environment to \nminimize operational risks. The Firmwide Compliance and \nOperational Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing \ncompliance and operational risk for our business. \nOur operational risk management framework is designed to \ncomply with the operational risk measurement rules under \nthe Capital Framework and has evolved based on the \nchanging needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. \nWe have established policies that require all employees and \nconsultants to report and escalate operational risk events. \nWhen operational risk events are identified, our policies \nrequire that the events be documented and analyzed to \ndetermine whether changes are required in our systems and/\nor processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. \nWe use operational risk management applications to capture, \nanalyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and \nkey metrics. One of our key risk identification and control \nassessment tools is an operational risk and control self-\nassessment process, which is performed by our managers. \nThis process consists of the identification and rating of \noperational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related \ncontrols. The results from this process are analyzed to \nevaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, \nactivities or products with heightened levels of operational \nrisk. \nRisk Measurement \nWe measure our operational risk exposure using both \nstatistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve \nqualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and \nexternal operational risk event data and internal control \nfactors for each of our businesses. Operational risk \nmeasurement also incorporates an assessment of business \nenvironment factors, including: \n• Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities; \n• The degree of automation in our processes; \n• New activity information; \n• The legal and regulatory environment; and \n• Changes in the markets for our products and services, \nincluding the diversity and sophistication of our customers \nand counterparties. \nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor \nchanges in operational risk and to determine business lines \nthat may have heightened exposure to operational risk. We \nalso perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and \nStructure of Risk Management” for information about \nfirmwide stress tests. \nTypes of Operational Risks \nIncreased \nreliance \non \ntechnology \nand \nthird-party \nrelationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such \nas third-party risk, business resilience risk and cybersecurity \nrisk. See “Cybersecurity Risk Management” for information \nabout our cybersecurity risk management process. We \nmanage third-party and business resilience risks as follows: \nThird-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is \nthe risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties \nperforming services or activities on our behalf. These risks \nmay \ninclude \nlegal, \nregulatory, \ninformation \nsecurity, \ncybersecurity, reputational, operational or other risks \ninherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and \nreport key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across \nmultiple risk domains, including information security and \ncybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain \ndependencies. \nWe \nevaluate \nwhether \nvendors \ndesign, \nimplement, and maintain information security controls \nconsistent with our security policies and standards. Vendors \nthat access and process our information on their \ninfrastructure external to our network are required to \nundergo an initial risk assessment, resulting in the assignment \nof a vendor inherent risk rating that is determined based on a \nnumber of factors, including the type of data stored and \nprocessed by a particular vendor. Subsequently, we conduct \nre-certifications \nat \na \ndepth \nand \nfrequency \nthat \nis \ncommensurate with each vendor’s inherent risk rating as a \ncomponent of our risk-based approach to vendor oversight. \nVendors are required to agree to standard contractual \nprovisions before receiving sensitive information from us. \nThese provisions have specific information security control \nrequirements, which apply to vendors that store, access, \ntransmit or otherwise process sensitive information on our \nbehalf. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and \nreassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See “Risk \nFactors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further \ninformation about third-party risk. \nBusiness Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk \nof disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats \nand assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in \nthe event of a significant operational disruption to the normal \noperations of our critical functions or their dependencies, \nsuch as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or \npersonnel. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental \nprinciples for BCP and crisis management to ensure that \ncritical functions can continue to operate in the event of a \ndisruption. We seek to maintain a business continuity \nprogram that is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide \nbasis, and up-to-date, incorporating new information, \nincluding resilience capabilities. Our resilience assurance \nprogram encompasses testing of response and recovery \nstrategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing \nand preventing significant operational disruptions. See \n“Business — Business Continuity and Information Security” \nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information \nabout business continuity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n121\nCybersecurity Risk Management \nOverview\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of compromising the \nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and \nsystems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, \nour clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to \nminimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, \ndisruption or use of information and/or information systems. \nWe deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and \nprocesses to mitigate emerging and evolving information \nsecurity and cybersecurity threats, including monitoring our \nnetwork for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized \nattempts to access our data and systems. There is increased \ninformation risk through diversification of our data across \nexternal service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-\nprovided or -hosted services and applications. In addition, \nnew AI technologies may increase the frequency and severity \nof cybersecurity attacks. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A \nof this Form 10-K for further information about information \nand cybersecurity risk. \nCybersecurity Risk Management Process\nOur cybersecurity risk management processes are integrated \ninto our overall risk management processes described in the \n“Overview and Structure of Risk Management.” We have \nestablished an Information Security and Cybersecurity \nProgram (the Cybersecurity Program), administered by \nTechnology Risk within Engineering, and overseen by our \nCISO. This program is designed to identify, assess, document \nand mitigate threats, govern, establish and evaluate \ncompliance with information security mandates, adopt and \napply our security control framework, and prevent, detect \nand respond to security incidents. The Cybersecurity \nProgram is periodically reviewed and modified to respond to \nchanging threats and conditions. A dedicated Operational \nRisk team, which reports to the chief risk officer, provides \noversight and challenge of the Cybersecurity Program, \nindependent of Technology Risk, and assesses the operating \neffectiveness of the program against industry standard \nframeworks and Board risk appetite-approved operational \nrisk limits and thresholds. \nOur process for managing cybersecurity risk includes the \ncritical components of our risk management framework \ndescribed in the “Overview and Structure of Risk \nManagement,” as well as the following:\n• Training and education, to enable our people to recognize \ninformation and cybersecurity threats and respond \naccordingly;\n• Identity and access management, including entitlement \nmanagement and production access;\n• Application and software security, including software \nchange management, open source software, and backup \nand restoration;\n• Infrastructure security, including monitoring our network \nfor known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized \nattempts to access our data and systems;\n• Mobile security, including mobile applications;\n• Data security, including cryptography and encryption, \ndatabase security, data erasure and media disposal;\n• Cloud computing, including governance and security of \ncloud \napplications, \nand \nsoftware-as-a-service \ndata \nonboarding;\n• Technology operations, including change management, \nincident management, capacity and resilience; and\n• Third-party \nrisk \nmanagement, \nincluding \nvendor \nmanagement and governance, and cybersecurity and \nbusiness resiliency on vendor assessments.\nIn conjunction with third-party vendors and consultants, we \nperform risk assessments to gauge the performance of the \nCybersecurity Program, to estimate our risk profile and to \nassess compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. We \nperform periodic assessments of control efficacy through our \ninternal risk and control self-assessment process, as well as a \nvariety of external technical assessments, including external \npenetration tests and “red team” engagements where third \nparties test our defenses. The results of these risk \nassessments, together with control performance findings, are \nused to establish priorities, allocate resources, and identify \nand improve controls. We use third parties, such as outside \nforensics firms, to augment our cyber incident response \ncapabilities. We have a vendor management program that \ndocuments a risk-based framework for managing third-party \nvendor relationships. Information security risk management \nis built into our vendor management process, which covers \nvendor selection, onboarding, performance monitoring and \nrisk management. See “Third-Party Risk” for further \ninformation about vendor risk. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n122\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nDuring 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats \nthat have materially affected or are reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect our business strategy, results of operations \nor \nfinancial \ncondition. \nTechnology \nRisk \nmonitors \ncybersecurity threats and risks from information security and \ncybersecurity matters on an ongoing basis, and allocates \nresources and directs operations in a manner designed to \nmitigate those risks. For example, in response to the \nproliferation of AI-enabled fraud and ransomware attacks \nthat continue to be reported globally, we have emphasized \nphishing and cybersecurity training for our employees and \nallocated additional resources for business continuity. \nHowever, despite these efforts, we cannot eliminate all \ncybersecurity risks or provide assurances that we have not \nhad occurrences of undetected cybersecurity incidents. \nGovernance\nThe Board, both directly and through its committees, \nincluding its Risk Committee and Technology Risk \nSubcommittee, oversees our risk management policies and \npractices, including cybersecurity risks, and information \nsecurity and cybersecurity matters. Our chief risk officer, \nchief information officer and chief technology officer, among \nothers, periodically brief the Board on operational and \ntechnology risks, including cybersecurity risks, relevant to us. \nThe Board also receives regular briefings from our CISO on a \nrange of cybersecurity-related topics, including the status of \nour Cybersecurity Program, emerging cybersecurity threats, \nmitigation strategies and related regulatory engagements. In \naddition, these are topics on which various directors \nmaintain an ongoing dialogue with our CISO, chief \ninformation officer and chief technology officer. \nOur CISO is responsible for managing and implementing the \nCybersecurity Program and reports directly to our chief \ninformation officer. Our CISO oversees our Technology Risk \nteam, which assesses and manages material risks from \ncybersecurity threats, sets firmwide control requirements, \nassesses adherence to controls, and oversees incident \ndetection and response.\nIn addition, we have a series of committees and steering \ngroups that oversee the implementation of our cybersecurity \nrisk management strategy and framework. These committees \nand steering groups are informed about cybersecurity \nincidents and risks by designated members of Technology \nRisk, who periodically report to these committees and \nsteering groups about the Cybersecurity Program, including \nthe efforts of the Technology Risk teams to prevent, detect, \nmitigate and remediate incidents and threats. These \ncommittees and steering groups enable formal escalation and \nreporting of risks, and our CISO and other members of \nTechnology Risk provide regular briefings to senior \nmanagement.\nThe Firmwide Technology Risk Committee is responsible for \nreviewing matters related to the design, development, \ndeployment and use of technology. This committee oversees \ncybersecurity matters, as well as technology risk management \nframeworks \nand \nmethodologies, \nand \nmonitors \ntheir \neffectiveness. This committee is co-chaired by our CISO and \nour chief technology officer, and reports to the Firmwide \nEnterprise Risk Committee. To assist the Firmwide \nTechnology Risk Committee in carrying out its mandate, the \nFirmwide \nArtificial \nIntelligence \nRisk \nand \nControls \nCommittee, which oversees risks associated with the use of \nAI, reports to the Firmwide Technology Risk Committee. See \n“Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for further \ninformation about this committee. \nThe Digital Risk Office Steering Group oversees Engineering \nrisk decisions, monitors control performance and reviews \napproaches to comply with current and emerging regulation \napplicable to Engineering. This steering group is co-chaired \nby our CISO, chief technology officer and chief digital risk \nofficer, and reports to the Firmwide Technology Risk \nCommittee. \nOur CISO, senior management within Technology Risk and \nOperational Risk, as well as management personnel \noverseeing the Cybersecurity Program, all have substantial \nrelevant expertise in the areas of information security and \ncybersecurity risk management. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We rely on quantitative models \nacross our business activities primarily to value certain \nfinancial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our \nrisk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. \nModel Risk, which is part of our second line of defense, is \nindependent of our model developers, model owners and \nmodel users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary \nresponsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our \nmodel risk by providing firmwide oversight and challenge \nacross our global businesses. \nOur model risk management framework is managed through \na governance structure and risk management controls, which \nencompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a \ncomprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment \nand classification, sound model development practices, \nindependent review and model-specific usage controls. The \nFirmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our \nmodel risk management framework. \nModel Review and Validation Process \nModel Risk consists of quantitative professionals who \nperform an independent review, validation and approval of \nour models. This review includes an analysis of the model \ndocumentation, independent testing, an assessment of the \nappropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of \ncompliance with model development and implementation \nstandards. \nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect \nchanges in market or economic conditions and our business \nmix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new \nmodels or significant changes to existing models and their \nassumptions are approved prior to implementation. \nThe model validation process incorporates a review of \nmodels and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of \nscenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically \nevaluate and verify: \n• The \nmodel’s \nconceptual \nsoundness, \nincluding \nthe \nreasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for \nintended use; \n• The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to \nensure that the models function as intended; \n• The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated \nin the model; \n• The model’s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the \nrelated product and its significant risks; \n• The model’s consistency with models for similar products; \nand \n• The \nmodel’s \nsensitivity \nto \ninput \nparameters \nand \nassumptions. \nSee “Critical Accounting Policies — Fair Value — Review of \nValuation Models,” “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market \nRisk Management,” “Credit Risk Management” and \n“Operational Risk Management” for further information \nabout our use of models within these areas. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n124\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nOther Risk Management \nIn addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also \nmanage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance, \nconflicts and reputational. These areas of risks are discussed \nbelow. \nCapital Risk Management \nCapital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to \nsupport our business activities under normal and stressed \nmarket conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA \nincreases, including from new or revised rules or changes in \ninterpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to \nmeet our internal capital targets or external regulatory \ncapital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical \nimportance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a \ncomprehensive capital management policy that provides a \nframework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to \nmaintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in \nboth business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital \nmanagement framework is designed to provide us with the \ninformation needed to identify and comprehensively manage \nrisk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that \ncapture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding \nsufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after \nexperiencing a severe stress event. See “Capital Management \nand Regulatory Capital” for further information about our \ncapital management process. \nWe have established a comprehensive governance structure to \nmanage and oversee our day-to-day capital management \nactivities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and \nrelated policies. Our capital management activities are \noverseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is \nresponsible for approving our annual capital plan and the \nRisk Committee of the Board approves our capital \nmanagement policy, which details the risk committees and \nmembers of senior management who are responsible for the \nongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation \nof current and future regulatory capital requirements, the \nreview of the results of our capital planning and stress tests \nprocesses, and the results of our capital models. In addition, \nour risk committees and senior management are responsible \nfor the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital \nadequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and \ncapital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as \nmonitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital \nrequirements. \nOur process for managing capital risk also includes \nindependent oversight by Risk that assesses our capital \nmanagement framework, regulatory capital policies and \nrelated interpretations and escalates certain interpretations to \nsenior management and/or the appropriate risk committee. \nThis oversight includes, among other things, independent \nreview and challenge of our capital ratio targets, planned \ncapital actions and regulatory capital calculations; analysis of \nthe related documentation; independent testing; and an \nassessment of the appropriateness of the calculations and \ntheir alignment with the relevant regulatory capital rules. \nClimate-Related and Environmental Risk Management \nWe categorize climate-related and environmental risks into \nphysical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the risk that \nasset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a \nresult of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the \nrisk that asset values may decline because of changes in \nclimate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to \ndecarbonization. \nClimate-related and environmental risks manifest in different \nways across our businesses. We have continued to make \nsignificant enhancements to our climate risk management \nframework, including steps to further integrate climate risk \ninto our broader risk management processes. We have \nintegrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk \nmanagement governance structure, from senior management \nto our Board and its committees, including the Risk and \nPublic Responsibilities committees. The Risk Committee of \nthe Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, \nwhich include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, \nreceives updates on our risk management approach to climate \nrisk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and \nintegration into existing risk management processes. The \nPublic Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the \nBoard in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy \nand sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect \nto climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public \nResponsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our \nsustainability strategy and disclosures, and also periodically \nreviews our governance and related policies and processes for \nclimate and other sustainability-related matters. Senior \nmanagement within Risk, in coordination with senior \nmanagement in our revenue-producing units, is responsible \nfor the development of the climate-related and environmental \nrisk program. The objective of this program is to integrate \nclimate-related and environmental risks into existing risk \ndisciplines and business considerations, such as the \nintegration of climate risk into our credit evaluation and \nunderwriting processes for select industries.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n125\nSee “Business — Sustainability” in Part I, Item 1 and “Risk \nFactors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information \nabout our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to \nclimate transition. \nCompliance Risk Management \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, \nmaterial financial loss or damage to our reputation arising \nfrom our failure to comply with the requirements of \napplicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal \npolicies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all \nactivities through which we conduct our businesses. Our \nCompliance Risk Management Program, administered by \nCompliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and \nreputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or \namended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements \ncontrols, policies, procedures and training; conducts \nindependent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for \ncompliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to \nregulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor \nand review business practices to assess whether they meet or \nexceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all \nmarkets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. \nConflicts Management \nConflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them \nare fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation \nand our long-term success. The term “conflict of interest” \ndoes not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts \ncan arise in many forms within a business or between \nbusinesses. The responsibility for identifying potential \nconflicts, as well as complying with our policies and \nprocedures, is shared by all of our employees. \nWe have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and \naddressing reputational risk. Our senior management \noversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in \nconjunction \nwith \nConflicts \nResolution, \nLegal \nand \nCompliance, and internal committees, formulates policies, \nstandards and principles, and assists in making judgments \nregarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. \nResolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts \nand circumstances of a particular situation and the \napplication of experienced and informed judgment. \nAs a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing \nand advisory assignments in Global Banking & Markets and \ncertain of our investing, lending and other activities. In \naddition, we have various transaction oversight committees \nthat also review new underwritings, loans, investments and \nstructured products. These groups and committees work with \ninternal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate \nand address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of \nConflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who \nreports to our chief executive officer. \nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address \nconflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in \naccordance with the highest ethical standards and in \ncompliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. \nReputational Risk Management\nReputational risk is the potential risk that negative publicity \nregarding our business practices, whether true or not, will \ncause a decline in our customer base, costly litigation or \nrevenue reductions. Our reputation is critical to effectively \nserving our clients and fostering and maintaining long-term \nclient relationships, and it is integral to how we are viewed \nby our key stakeholders.\nIn evaluating business opportunities, reputational risk is one \nof the most significant components we consider. We evaluate \nthe ethics, suitability and transparency of transactions \nundertaken by us. Our employees are responsible for \nconsidering the reputational impacts that our business \nactivities may have. \nWe have implemented a comprehensive program designed to \nmonitor reputational risk. The Firmwide Reputational Risk \nCommittee, which reports into the Firmwide Enterprise Risk \nCommittee, is responsible for assessing reputational risks \narising from business opportunities that have been identified \nas having potential heightened reputational risk. This \ncommittee is also responsible for overseeing client-related \nbusiness standards and addressing client-related reputational \nrisk and considers, among other things, the potential effects \nany business opportunities, products, transactions, new \nactivities, acquisitions, dispositions or investments could \nhave on our reputation. \nFor further information about our risk management \nprocesses, \nsee \n“Overview \nand \nStructure \nof \nRisk \nManagement” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this \nForm 10-K.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Financial Statements and \nSupplementary Data\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control \nover Financial Reporting\nManagement of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together \nwith its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for \nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting. The firm’s internal control over financial \nreporting is a process designed under the supervision of the \nfirm’s principal executive and principal financial officers to \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of the firm’s financial \nstatements for external reporting purposes in accordance \nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of December 31, 2024, management conducted an \nassessment of the firm’s internal control over financial \nreporting based on the framework established in Internal \nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the \nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management \nhas determined that the firm’s internal control over financial \nreporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies \nand procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records \nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect \ntransactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable \nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with \nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that \nreceipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance \nwith authorizations of management and the directors of the \nfirm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention \nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or \ndisposition of the firm’s assets that could have a material \neffect on our financial statements.\nThe firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of \nDecember \n31, \n2024 \nhas \nbeen \naudited \nby \nPricewaterhouseCoopers \nLLP \n(PCAOB \nID \n238), \nan \nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its \nreport appearing below, which expresses an unqualified \nopinion on the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n127\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goldman \nSachs Group, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control \nover Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance \nsheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries \n(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the \nrelated \nconsolidated \nstatements \nof \nearnings, \nof \ncomprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity \nand of cash flows for each of the three years in the period \nended December 31, 2024, including the related notes \n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial \nstatements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, \nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated \nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred \nto above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of \nthe three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in \nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States of America. Also in our opinion, the \nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective \ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, \n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – \nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company’s management is responsible for these \nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective \ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over \nfinancial \nreporting, \nincluded \nin \nthe \naccompanying \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial \nReporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the \nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on \nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with \nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with \nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and \nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting \nwas maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included \nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures \nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts \nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our \naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \nand significant estimates made by management, as well as \nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over \nfinancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of \ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk \nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating \nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control \nbased on the assessed risk. Our audits also included \nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary \nin the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a \nreasonable basis for our opinions. \nReport  of  Independent  Registered  Public \nAccounting Firm\n128\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial \nReporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a \nprocess designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of \nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those \npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect \nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the \ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions \nare recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company \nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide \nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of \nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the \ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters \narising from the current period audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to \nbe communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated \nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially \nchallenging, \nsubjective, \nor \ncomplex \njudgments. \nThe \ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any \nway our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, \ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the \ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on \nthe critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to \nwhich they relate. \nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments \nAs described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial \nstatements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company carries \nfinancial instruments at fair value, which includes $20.4 \nbillion of financial assets and $25.7 billion of financial \nliabilities classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (a \nportion of which relates to certain equity securities and \nhybrid financial instruments), as one or more inputs to the \nfinancial instrument’s valuation technique are significant and \nunobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by \nmanagement to value certain of the level 3 financial \ninstruments included market multiples, discount rates, and \ncapitalization rates for equity securities; and correlation and \nvolatility for hybrid financial instruments.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that \nperforming procedures relating to the valuation of certain \nlevel 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) \nthe significant judgment by management when developing \nthe fair value estimate of certain level 3 financial instruments, \n(ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort \nin performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence \nrelated to the significant unobservable inputs related to \nmarket multiples, discount rates, and capitalization rates for \nequity securities; and correlation for hybrid financial \ninstruments, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. \nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of \ncontrols relating to the valuation of financial instruments, \nincluding controls over the methods and aforementioned \nsignificant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of \ncertain level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also \nincluded, among others, testing the completeness and \naccuracy of data used by management, as well as (i) testing \nmanagement’s process for developing the fair value estimate \nof certain level 3 financial instruments, (ii) evaluating the \nappropriateness of the techniques used by management, (iii) \nevaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned \nsignificant unobservable inputs, and either (iv) the use of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in \nevaluating (a) the appropriateness of the techniques used by \nmanagement \nand \n(b) \nthe \nreasonableness \nof \nthe \naforementioned significant unobservable inputs, or (v) the \nuse of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to \nassist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s \nestimate by (a) evaluating the appropriateness of the \ntechniques used by management and (b) developing an \nindependent estimate of fair value for a sample of certain \nlevel \n3 \nsecurities \nusing \nindependently \ndetermined \nassumptions, and comparing the independent range of prices \nto management’s estimate.\nReport  of  Independent  Registered  Public \nAccounting Firm\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n129\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Wholesale Loan Portfolio\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial \nstatements, the allowance for credit losses was $4.7 billion as \nof December 31, 2024, of which $2.1 billion relates to the \nwholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses for \nwholesale loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is \nmeasured using a modeled approach. These models \ndetermine the probability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including internal credit \nratings, industry default and loss data, expected life and \nmacroeconomic indicators (the most significant to the \nforecast model being the forecasted U.S. unemployment and \nU.S. GDP growth rates), the borrower’s capacity to meet its \nfinancial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and \nindustry, loan seniority and collateral type. The allowance \nfor credit losses also includes qualitative components which \nallow management to reflect the uncertain nature of \neconomic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model \ninputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration \nrisk. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that \nperforming procedures relating to the allowance for credit \nlosses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit \nmatter are (i) the significant judgment by management when \ndeveloping the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale \nloan portfolio using a modeled approach, (ii) a high degree of \nauditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence related to management’s internal \ncredit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP \ngrowth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the \nuncertain nature of economic forecasting, and (iii) the audit \neffort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill \nand knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. \nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of \ncontrols relating to the allowance for credit losses for the \nwholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, \nincluding controls over the determination of management’s \ninternal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and \nU.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to \nreflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. These \nprocedures also included, among others, (i) testing \nmanagement’s process for developing the allowance for credit \nlosses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled \napproach (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data \nused in the estimate, and (iii) the involvement of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in \nevaluating (a) the appropriateness of the forecast model and \nmethodology used by management (b) the reasonableness of \nmanagement’s internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. \nunemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and (c) the \nreasonableness of the qualitative component to reflect the \nuncertain nature of economic forecasting. \n/s/  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 26, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1922.\nReport  of  Independent  Registered  Public \nAccounting Firm\n130\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nYear Ended December\nin millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n135\nNote 2. \nBasis of Presentation \nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of \nGroup Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a \ncontrolling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and \nbalances have been eliminated. \nAll references to 2024, 2023 and 2022 refer to the firm’s years \nended, or the dates, as the context requires, December  31, \n2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, \nrespectively. Any reference to a future year refers to a year \nending on December 31 of that year. Certain reclassifications \nhave been made to previously reported amounts to conform \nto the current presentation. \nNote 3. \nSignificant Accounting Policies \nThe firm’s significant accounting policies include when and \nhow to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, \nmeasuring the allowance for credit losses on loans and \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, and \nwhen to consolidate an entity. See Note 4 for policies on fair \nvalue measurements, Note 9 for policies on the allowance for \ncredit losses, and below and Note 17 for policies on \nconsolidation accounting.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n136\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nConsolidation \nThe firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a \ncontrolling financial interest. The firm determines whether it \nhas a controlling financial interest in an entity by first \nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a \nvariable interest entity (VIE). \nVoting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are entities \nin which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to \nenable the entity to finance its activities independently and \n(ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities \nof the entity that most significantly impact its economic \nperformance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity \nand the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The \nusual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If \nthe firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting \ninterest entity, the entity is consolidated. \nVariable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks one \nor more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The \nfirm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the \nfirm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) \nthe power to direct the activities of the VIE that most \nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) \nthe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to \nreceive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be \nsignificant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information \nabout VIEs. \nEquity-Method Investments. When the firm does not have \na controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert \nsignificant influence over the entity’s operating and financial \npolicies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option available under U.S. \nGAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm \nowns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. \nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of \naccounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or \nclosely related to the firm’s principal business activities, \nwhen the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the \ncash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit \nconsiderations are less significant. See Note 8 for further \ninformation about equity-method investments."

    "text": "Investment Funds. The firm has formed investment funds \nwith third-party investors. These funds are typically \norganized as limited partnerships or limited liability \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general partner or \nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the \neconomic interests in these funds. These funds are usually \nvoting interest entities and generally are not consolidated \nbecause third-party investors typically have rights to \nterminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner \nor manager. Investments in these funds are generally \nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in \ninvestments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information \nabout investments in funds. \nUse of Estimates \nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements \nrequires management to make certain estimates and \nassumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value \nmeasurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, \nprovisions for losses that may arise from litigation and \nregulatory \nproceedings \n(including \ngovernmental \ninvestigations), and accounting for income taxes. These \nestimates and assumptions are based on the best available \ninformation, but actual results could be materially different. \nRevenue Recognition \nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value. Trading \nassets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at \nfair value either under the fair value option or in accordance \nwith other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to \naccount for certain of its loans and other financial assets and \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The \nfair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the \nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices \nand financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value \nmeasurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value \ngains or losses are generally included in market making or \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for further \ninformation about fair value measurements. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n137\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm \nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for \nservices, \nsuch \nas \ninvestment \nbanking, \ninvestment \nmanagement, and execution and clearing (contracts with \nclients), when the performance obligations related to the \nunderlying transaction are completed. \nRevenues \nfrom \ncontracts \nwith \nclients \nrepresent \napproximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for both \n2024 and 2023 (including approximately 85% of investment \nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of investment \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and fees), and \napproximately 50% of total non-interest revenues for 2022 \n(including approximately 85% of investment banking \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment management \nrevenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for \ninformation about net revenues by business segment. \nInvestment Banking \nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory assignments are \nrecognized in revenues when the services related to the \nunderlying transaction are completed under the terms of the \nassignment. \nNon-refundable \ndeposits \nand \nmilestone \npayments in connection with financial advisory assignments \nare recognized in revenues upon completion of the \nunderlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise \nconcluded. \nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments are \nrecognized when incurred and are included in transaction \nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are \nincluded in investment banking revenues. \nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting assignments are \nrecognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying \ntransaction based on the terms of the assignment. \nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or \nthe assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are \nincluded in transaction based expenses for completed \nassignments. \nInvestment Management \nThe firm earns management fees and incentive fees for \ninvestment management services, which are included in \ninvestment management revenues. The firm makes payments \nto brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm’s \ninvestment funds (distribution fees), which are included in \ntransaction based expenses. \nManagement Fees. Management fees for mutual funds are \ncalculated as a percentage of daily NAV and are received \nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds are calculated as \na percentage of month-end NAV and are generally received \nquarterly. Management fees for separately managed accounts \nare calculated as a percentage of either the daily or monthly \nNAV and are received quarterly. Management fees for \nprivate equity funds are calculated as a percentage of \nmonthly invested capital or committed capital and are \ngenerally received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, \ndepending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over \ntime in the period the services are provided. \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on \neither a percentage of the management fee, the investment \nfund’s NAV or the committed capital. Such fees are included \nin transaction based expenses. \nIncentive Fees. Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage \nof a fund’s or separately managed account’s return, or excess \nreturn above a specified benchmark or other performance \ntarget. Incentive fees are generally based on investment \nperformance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-\nmonth period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of \nthe measurement period. For fees that are based on \ninvestment performance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees previously \ndistributed to the firm to be returned to the fund. \nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed \naccount are recognized when it is probable that a significant \nreversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when \nsuch fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market \nvalue of investments held by the fund or separately managed \naccount. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the \nperiod may relate to performance obligations satisfied in \nprevious periods. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n138\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nCommissions and Fees \nThe firm earns substantially all commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on stock, options \nand futures markets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) \ntransactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the \nday the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party \nresearch services to clients in connection with certain soft-\ndollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by \nthe firm in connection with such arrangements are presented \nnet within commissions and fees. \nRemaining Performance Obligations \nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm \nhas committed to perform in the future in connection with its \ncontracts with clients. The firm’s remaining performance \nobligations are generally related to its financial advisory \nassignments and certain investment management activities. \nRevenues associated with remaining performance obligations \nrelating to financial advisory assignments cannot be \ndetermined until the outcome of the transaction. For the \nfirm’s investment management activities, where fees are \ncalculated based on the NAV of the fund or separately \nmanaged account, future revenues associated with such \nremaining performance obligations cannot be determined as \nsuch fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of \ninvestments held by the fund or separately managed account. \nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated \nwith management fees calculated based on committed \ncapital. As of December 2024, substantially all future net \nrevenues associated with such remaining performance \nobligations will be recognized through 2033. Annual \nrevenues associated with such performance obligations \naverage less than $300 million through 2033. \nTransfers of Financial Assets \nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when \nthe firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. \nFor transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any \ngains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or \nliabilities that arise from the firm’s continuing involvement \nwith transferred financial assets are initially recognized at \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not \naccounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in \ntrading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related interest expense \nrecognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for \nfurther information about transfers of financial assets \naccounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for \nfurther information about transfers of financial assets \naccounted for as sales. \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nThe firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight \ndeposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and \ncash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $5.36 \nbillion as of December 2024 and $7.93 billion as of December \n2023. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-\nbearing deposits with banks of $176.73 billion as of \nDecember 2024 and $233.65 billion as of December 2023. \nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes \nrelated to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes were $14.84 \nbillion as of December 2024 and $17.08 billion as of \nDecember 2023. In addition, the firm segregates securities for \nregulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See \nNote 11 for further information about segregated securities. \nCustomer and Other Receivables \nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from \ncustomers and counterparties of $92.88 billion as of \nDecember 2024 and $90.16 billion as of December 2023, and \nreceivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations \nof $40.84 billion as of December 2024 and $42.33 billion as of \nDecember 2023. Such receivables primarily consist of \ncustomer margin loans, collateral posted in connection with \ncertain derivative transactions, and receivables resulting from \nunsettled transactions.\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at \namortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which \ngenerally approximates fair value. As these receivables are \nnot accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the \nfirm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these \nreceivables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, \nsubstantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of \nboth December 2024 and December 2023. See Note 10 for \nfurther information about customer and other receivables \naccounted for at fair value under the fair value option. \nInterest on customer and other receivables is recognized over \nthe life of the transaction and included in interest income. \nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from \ncontracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets \nrepresent the firm’s right to receive consideration for services \nprovided in connection with its contracts with clients for \nwhich collection is conditional and not merely subject to the \npassage of time. The firm’s receivables from contracts with \nclients were $4.08 billion as of December 2024 and $3.59 \nbillion as of December 2023. As of both December 2024 and \nDecember 2023, contract assets were not material. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n139\nCustomer and Other Payables \nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers \nand counterparties of $217.15 billion as of December 2024 \nand $220.71 billion as of December 2023, and payables to \nbrokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $6.11 billion as \nof December 2024 and $10.02 billion as of December 2023. \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer credit balances \nrelated to the firm’s prime brokerage activities. Customer \nand other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued \ninterest, which generally approximates fair value. As these \npayables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not \nincluded in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. \nHad these payables been included in the firm’s fair value \nhierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level \n2 as of both December 2024 and December 2023. Interest on \ncustomer and other payables is recognized over the life of the \ntransaction and included in interest expense. \nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities \nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities \nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting \nagreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset \nreceivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting \nagreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, \nincluding upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-\ndefaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, \nall transactions governed by the netting agreement are \nterminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In \naddition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities \ncollateral with respect to its derivatives and securities \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms of the related \ncredit \nsupport \nagreements \nor \nsimilar \narrangements \n(collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable \ncredit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party \nexercising termination rights the right to liquidate the \ncollateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In \norder to assess enforceability of the firm’s right of setoff \nunder netting and credit support agreements, the firm \nevaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy \nlaws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the \njurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., \nthe net payable or receivable for derivative assets and \nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated \nbalance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an \nenforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and \nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase \nagreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions \nwith the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when \nsuch transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are \nsubject to netting agreements. \nIn the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported \nnet of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable \ncredit support agreements, when transacted under an \nenforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance \nsheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities \nborrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash \nand securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for \nfurther information about collateral received and pledged, \nincluding rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 \nand 11 for further information about offsetting assets and \nliabilities. \nForeign Currency Translation \nAssets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are \ntranslated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the \nconsolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are \ntranslated at average rates of exchange for the period. \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses on \ntransactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in \nearnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial \nstatements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of \nhedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of \ncomprehensive income. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n140\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nRecent Accounting Developments \nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures \n(ASC 326). In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. \n2022-02, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326) \n— Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” \nThis ASU eliminates the recognition and measurement \nguidance for troubled debt restructurings and requires \nenhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers \nexperiencing financial difficulty. This ASU also requires \nenhanced disclosure for loans that have been charged off. \nThis ASU became effective for the firm in January 2023 \nunder a prospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not \nhave a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial \nstatements.\nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject \nto Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASC 820). In June \n2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, “Fair Value \nMeasurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale \nRestrictions.” This ASU clarifies that a contractual \nrestriction on the sale of an equity security should not be \nconsidered in measuring its fair value. In addition, the ASU \nrequires specific disclosures related to equity securities that \nare subject to contractual sale restrictions. This ASU became \neffective for the firm in January 2024 under a prospective \napproach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material \nimpact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements. \nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures \nUsing the Proportional Amortization Method (ASC \n323). In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, \n“Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic \n323) — Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures \nUsing the Proportional Amortization Method.” This ASU \nexpands the proportional amortization method election \ncurrently associated with low-income housing tax credits to \nother qualifying tax credits and requires incremental \ndisclosures for programs in which the proportional \namortization method is elected. This ASU became effective \nfor the firm in January 2024 under a modified retrospective \napproach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material \nimpact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures \n(ASC 280). In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. \n2023-07, \n“Improvements \nto \nReportable \nSegment \nDisclosures.” This ASU requires enhanced disclosures \nprimarily about significant segment expenses that are \nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. \nThis ASU became effective for the firm for annual periods \nbeginning in January 2024, and is effective for interim \nperiods beginning in January 2025 under a retrospective \napproach. \nSince \nthis \nASU \nonly \nrequires \nadditional \ndisclosures, adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on \nthe firm’s financial condition, results of operations or cash \nflows. See Note 25 for further information.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASC 740). \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \n“Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This ASU \nrequires incremental disclosures primarily related to the \nreconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective \nincome tax rate, as well as income taxes paid. This ASU is \neffective for the firm for annual periods beginning in January \n2025 under a prospective approach with the option to apply \nit retrospectively. Since this ASU only requires additional \ndisclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on \nthe firm’s financial condition, results of operations or cash \nflows.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASC \n220). In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \n“Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” This ASU \nrequires additional disaggregation of certain expenses within \nthe footnotes to the financial statements. This ASU is \neffective for the firm for annual periods beginning in January \n2027, and interim periods beginning in January 2028 under a \nprospective approach. Early adoption and retrospective \napplication is permitted. Since this ASU only requires \nadditional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an \nimpact on the firm’s financial condition, results of operations \nor cash flows.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n141\nNote 4. \nFair Value Measurements \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that \nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \nliability \nin \nan \norderly \ntransaction \nbetween \nmarket \nparticipants at the measurement date. Financial assets are \nmarked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to \noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not include \ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets \nand liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). \nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, \nfair value is determined by reference to prices for similar \ninstruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less \nactive markets, or internally developed models that primarily \nuse market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, \nbut not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt \nprices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit \nspreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a \ngiven financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest \nrate). \nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair \nvalue measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the \nvaluation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the \nhighest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to \nlevel 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this hierarchy \nis based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its \nfair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a \nvaluation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a \nportfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value \nhierarchy is as follows: \nLevel 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active \nmarkets to which the firm had access at the measurement \ndate for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. \nLevel 2. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either \ndirectly or indirectly. \nLevel 3. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are \nsignificant and unobservable. \nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm’s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable prices and \ninputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value \nhierarchy.

See Note 5 for further \ninformation about level 3 financial assets (including \ninformation about unrealized gains and losses related to level \n3 financial assets and transfers into and out of level 3). \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n142\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs \nused to determine the fair value of the firm’s financial \ninstruments are described below. See Note 5 for further \ninformation about significant unobservable inputs used to \nvalue level 3 financial instruments. \nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for \nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans \nLevel 1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government \nobligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certain \nagency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, \ncertain money market instruments and actively traded listed \nequities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for \nidentical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm \ndefines active markets for equity instruments based on the \naverage daily trading volume both in absolute terms and \nrelative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The \nfirm defines active markets for debt instruments based on \nboth the average daily trading volume and the number of \ndays with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. \ngovernment obligations, most agency obligations, most \nmortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt \ninstruments, most state and municipal obligations, most \nmoney market instruments, most other debt obligations, \nrestricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted \nprices, recent trading activity for identical or similar \ninstruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative \npricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. \nConsideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., \nindicative or executable) and the relationship of recent \nmarket activity to the prices provided from alternative \npricing sources. \nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer \nrestrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity \ndiscounts that a market participant would require to arrive at \nfair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on \nmarket evidence. \nLevel 3. Level 3 instruments have one or more significant \nvaluation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to \nthe contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at \ntransaction price, which is considered to be the best initial \nestimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other \nmethodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on \nthe type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are \nchanged when corroborated by substantive observable \nevidence, including values realized on sales. \nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by \ninstrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow \ntechniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of \nsignificant inputs used to determine the fair values of each \ntype of level 3 instrument are described below: \nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real \nEstate \nLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate are \ndirectly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a \nportfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying \nlevels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally \ndetermined based on relative value analyses and include: \n• Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related \nassets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, \nsuch as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance \nof commercial mortgage bonds); \n• Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and \ninstruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; \n• A measure of expected future cash flows in a default \nscenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the \nunderlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current \nperformance of the underlying collateral and capitalization \nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of \nnotional or face value of the instrument and reflect the \nbenefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and \n• Timing of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in \ncertain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loan \nforbearances \nand \nother \nunobservable \ninputs \n(e.g., \nprepayment speeds). \nLoans and Securities Backed by Residential Real \nEstate \nLoans and securities backed by residential real estate are \ndirectly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential \nreal estate and may include tranches of varying levels of \nsubordination. Significant inputs are generally determined \nbased on relative value analyses, which incorporate \ncomparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk \nprofiles. Significant inputs include: \n• Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related \nassets; \n• Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and \ninstruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; \nand\n• Duration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds \nand residential property liquidation timelines.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n143\nCorporate Debt Instruments \nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt \nsecurities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for \ncorporate debt instruments are generally determined based \non relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons \nboth to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same \nor similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt \ninstruments for the same or similar issuer for which \nobservable prices or broker quotations are available. \nSignificant inputs include: \n• Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related \nassets and/or current levels and trends of market indices, \nsuch as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance of \ncorporate credit);\n• Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where \nthe firm uses credit default swaps to value the related \ninstrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference \nobligation;\n• Duration; and\n• Market and transaction multiples for corporate debt \ninstruments with convertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities \nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent third-\nparty completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger \nproposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered \nthe best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are \nnot available, the following valuation methodologies are \nused, as appropriate: \n• Industry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue \nmultiples) and public comparables;\n• Transactions in similar instruments;\n• Discounted cash flow techniques; and\n• Third-party appraisals.\nThe firm also considers changes in the outlook for the \nrelevant industry and financial performance of the issuer as \ncompared to projected performance. Significant inputs \ninclude: \n• Market and transaction multiples;\n• Discount rates and capitalization rates; and\n• For equity securities with debt-like features, market yields \nimplied by transactions of similar or related assets, current \nperformance and recovery assumptions, and duration.\nOther Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and \nLoans \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other trading cash \ninstruments, investments and loans are generally determined \nbased on relative value analyses, which incorporate \ncomparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that \nreference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity \nand to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which \nobservable prices or broker quotations are available. \nSignificant inputs include: \n• Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related \nassets and/or current levels and trends of market indices; \n• Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where \nthe firm uses credit default swaps to value the related \ninstrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference \nobligation; and \n• Duration. \nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for \nDerivatives \nThe firm’s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using \nderivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, \ncorrelation models and models that incorporate option \npricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). \nPrice \ntransparency \nof \nderivatives \ncan \ngenerally \nbe \ncharacterized by product type, as described below. \n• Interest Rate. In general, the key inputs used to value \ninterest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most \nlong-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options \ndenominated in the currencies of leading industrialized \nnations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight \nbid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference \nindices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield \ncurve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are \nmore complex, but the key inputs are generally observable. \n• Credit. Price transparency for credit default swaps, \nincluding both single names and baskets of credits, varies \nby market and underlying reference entity or obligation. \nCredit default swaps that reference indices, large \ncorporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most \nprice transparency. For credit default swaps with other \nunderliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, \nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, \nand the availability of the underlying reference obligations \nfor delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default \nswaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and \nemerging market debt instruments tend to have less price \ntransparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In \naddition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those \nsensitive to the correlation between two or more \nunderlying reference obligations, generally have less price \ntransparency.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n144\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n• Currency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the \nexchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including \nthose with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The \nprimary difference between the price transparency of \ndeveloped and emerging market currency derivatives is that \nemerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts \nwith shorter tenors.\n• Commodity. Commodity derivatives include transactions \nreferenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity), \nmetals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., \nagricultural). Price transparency varies based on the \nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and \nproduct quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded \ngasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity \nderivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and \ncontracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or \nbenchmark commodity indices.\n• Equity. Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by \nmarket and underlier. Options on indices and the common \nstock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit \nthe most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally \nhave observable market prices, except for contracts with \nlong tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from \ncurrent market prices. More complex equity derivatives, \nsuch as those sensitive to the correlation between two or \nmore \nindividual \nstocks, \ngenerally \nhave \nless \nprice \ntransparency.\nLiquidity is essential to the observability of all product types. \nIf transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices \nand other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even \nhighly structured products may at times have trading \nvolumes large enough to provide observability of prices and \nother inputs.\nLevel 1. Level 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for \nfuture delivery of securities when the underlying security is a \nlevel 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they \nare actively traded and are valued at their quoted market \nprice.\nLevel 2. Level 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for \nwhich all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by \nmarket evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not \nactively traded and/or that are valued using models that \ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives. \nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative \ndepends on the contractual terms of and specific risks \ninherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of \npricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade \nin liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant \nmanagement judgment because outputs of models can be \ncalibrated to market-clearing levels. \nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as \ncontractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates \n(including those derived from interest rates on collateral \nreceived and posted as specified in credit support agreements \nfor collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of \nvolatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and \ncorrelations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the \nvaluations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market \ntransactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative \npricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. \nConsideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., \nindicative or executable) and the relationship of recent \nmarket activity to the prices provided from alternative \npricing sources. \nLevel 3. Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which \nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as \nunobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable \ninputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivatives are \ndescribed below. \n• For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant \nunobservable inputs include correlations of certain \ncurrencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between \nEuro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest \nrate and currency volatilities. \n• For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable \ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit \npoints, which are unique to specific reference obligations \nand reference entities, and recovery rates. \n• For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable \ninputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that \ndiffer significantly from current market prices and prices or \nspreads for certain products for which the product quality \nor physical location of the commodity is not aligned with \nbenchmark indices. \n• For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable \ninputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options \nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ \nsignificantly from current market prices. In addition, the \nvaluation of certain structured trades requires the use of \nlevel 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the \nprice performance of two or more individual stocks or the \ncorrelation of the price performance for a basket of stocks \nto another asset class, such as commodities. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n145\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the \nfirm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect \nobservable market changes and any resulting gains and losses \nare classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when \ncorroborated \nby \nevidence, \nsuch \nas \nsimilar \nmarket \ntransactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or \ndealer quotations or other empirical market data. In \ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value \nby reference to market transactions, it is possible that a \ndifferent valuation model could produce a materially \ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5 for further \ninformation about significant unobservable inputs used in the \nvaluation of level 3 derivatives. \nValuation \nAdjustments. \nValuation \nadjustments \nare \nintegral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios \nand are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced \nby derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These \nadjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of \nliquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, \nwhich account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the \nuncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm \nalso makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized \nderivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit \nthe firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-\nbased inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation \nadjustments to market-clearing levels. \nIn addition, for derivatives that include significant \nunobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price \nadjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present \nin the transaction.\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other \nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value \nIn addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and \ncertain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain \nof its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under \nthe fair value option. Such instruments include repurchase \nagreements and substantially all resale agreements; certain \nsecurities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain \ncustomer and other receivables, including certain margin \nloans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates \nof deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; \nsubstantially \nall \nother \nsecured \nfinancings, \nincluding \nstructured financing arrangements and transfers of assets \naccounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and \nlong-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid \nfinancial instruments; and certain other assets and liabilities. \nThese instruments are generally valued based on discounted \ncash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with \nreasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally \nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. \nValuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for \ncounterparty and the firm’s credit quality. The significant \ninputs used to value the firm’s other financial assets and \nliabilities are described below. \nResale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities \nBorrowed and Loaned. The significant inputs to the \nvaluation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities \nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and \ntiming of expected future cash flows and interest rates. \nCustomer and Other Receivables. The significant inputs \nto the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount \nand timing of expected future cash flows and funding \nspreads. \nDeposits. The significant inputs to the valuation of time \ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of \nfuture cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded \nderivative component of hybrid financial instruments are \nconsistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other \nderivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for \nfurther information about derivatives and Note 13 for further \ninformation about deposits. \nOther Secured Financings. The significant inputs to the \nvaluation of other secured financings are the amount and \ntiming of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding \nspreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the \nfirm (determined using the amount and timing of expected \nfuture cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery \nassumptions). See Note 11 for further information about \nother secured financings. \nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The \nsignificant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and \nlong-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected \nfuture cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm \nand commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. \nThe inputs used to value the embedded derivative component \nof hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs \nused to value the firm’s other derivative instruments \ndescribed above. See Note 7 for further information about \nderivatives and Note 14 for further information about \nborrowings. \nOther Assets and Liabilities. The significant inputs to the \nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are the amount and \ntiming of expected future cash flows, interest rates, market \nyields, volatility and correlation inputs. The inputs used to \nvalue the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial \ninstruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the \nfirm’s other derivative instruments described above.

An average \ngreater than the median indicates that the majority of \ninputs are below the average. For example, the difference \nbetween the average and the median for credit spreads \nindicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower \nend of the range. \n• The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not \nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to use when \ncalculating the fair value of any one derivative. For \nexample, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives \nis appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative \nbut may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest \nrate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not \nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value \nmeasurements of level 3 derivatives.\n• Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued \nusing option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued \nusing option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow \nmodels, and commodities derivatives are valued using \noption pricing and discounted cash flow models.\n• The fair value of any one instrument may be determined \nusing multiple valuation techniques. For example, option \npricing models and discounted cash flow models are \ntypically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, \nthe level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. \n• Correlation within currencies and equities includes cross-\nproduct type correlation. \n• Natural gas spread represents the spread per million British \nthermal units of natural gas.\n• Oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and \nrefined products. \n• Electricity price represents the price per megawatt hour of \nelectricity.\nRange \nof \nSignificant \nUnobservable \nInputs. The \nfollowing provides information about the ranges of \nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level \n3 derivative instruments: \n• Correlation. Ranges for correlation cover a variety of \nunderliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index \nand equity single stock names) and across product types \n(e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well \nas across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation \ninputs are used to value more complex instruments and are \nlower than correlation inputs on assets within the same \nderivative product type.\n• Volatility. Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers \nacross a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. \nFor example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower \nthan volatility of single stocks.\n• Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery \nrates. The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points \nand recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and \nsingle names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit \nqualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad \nrange of this population gives rise to the width of the \nranges of significant unobservable inputs. \n• Commodity prices and spreads. The ranges for \ncommodity prices and spreads cover variability in \nproducts, maturities and delivery locations. \nSensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in \nSignificant Unobservable Inputs. The following is a \ndescription of the directional sensitivity of the firm’s level 3 \nfair \nvalue \nmeasurements \nto \nchanges \nin \nsignificant \nunobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:\n• Correlation. In general, for contracts where the holder \nbenefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or \nindex prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign \nexchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an \nincrease in correlation results in a higher fair value \nmeasurement. \n• Volatility. In general, for purchased options, an increase in \nvolatility results in a higher fair value measurement. \n• Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery \nrates. In general, the fair value of purchased credit \nprotection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit \npoints increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, \nupfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related \nto distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference \nobligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, \nsuch as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk \nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the \nunderlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic \nconditions. \n• Commodity prices and spreads. In general, for \ncontracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an \nincrease in the spread (price difference from a benchmark \nindex due to differences in quality or delivery location) or \nprice results in a higher fair value measurement. \nDue to the distinctive nature of each of the firm’s level 3 \nderivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily \nuniform within each product type. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Similarly, a significant portion of the firm’s trading \ncash instruments and derivatives across product types has \nexposure to foreign currencies and may be economically \nhedged with foreign currency contracts.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n161\nNote 7. \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities \nDerivative Activities \nDerivatives are instruments that derive their value from \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other \ninputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be \ntraded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to \nas OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm’s OTC derivatives \nare \ncleared \nand \nsettled \nthrough \ncentral \nclearing \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateral \ncontracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC). \nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm enters into \nderivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to \nfacilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, \nthe firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit \ncapital to provide execution, and maintains market-making \npositions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. \nRisk Management. The firm also enters into derivatives to \nactively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-\nmaking and investing and financing activities. The firm’s \nholdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a \nportfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-\nby-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic \nhedging is reflected in the same business segment as the \nrelated revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into \nderivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These \nderivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of \ncertain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits and \ncertain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as \navailable-for-sale, foreign exchange risk of certain available-\nfor-sale securities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. \noperations and the exposure to the variability of the \nforecasted cash flows associated with certain floating-rate \nassets.\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including: \n• Futures \nand \nForwards. \nContracts \nthat \ncommit \ncounterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, \ncommodities or currencies in the future. \n• Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to exchange \ncash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. \nThe amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of \nthe contract with reference to specified rates, financial \ninstruments, commodities, currencies or indices. \n• Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has the \nright, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the \noption writer financial instruments, commodities or \ncurrencies within a defined time period for a specified \nprice. \nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., \nthe net payable or receivable for derivative assets and \nliabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of \nsetoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement \n(counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair \nvalue, net of cash collateral received or posted under \nenforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral \nnetting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and \nderivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. \nRealized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not \ndesignated as hedges are included in market making (for \nderivatives included in Fixed Income, Currency and \nCommodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Banking & \nMarkets), and other principal transactions (for derivatives \nincluded in Investment banking fees and Other within Global \nBanking & Markets, as well as derivatives in Asset & Wealth \nManagement) in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on \nthe firm’s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally \nindividually negotiated contracts and can have various \nsettlement and payment conventions. Credit events include \nfailure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, \nrestructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference \nentity. \nThe firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives: \n• Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps \nprotect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or \nmore bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in \nthe event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a \ncredit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or \nperiodic premium to the seller and receives protection for \nthe period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as \ndefined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no \npayments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of \nprotection is required to make a payment to the buyer, \ncalculated according to the terms of the contract.\n• Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer \nassumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference \nobligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option \npurchaser buys the right, but does not assume the \nobligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it \nfrom, the option writer. The payments on credit options \ndepend either on a particular credit spread or the price of \nthe reference obligation.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n164\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n• Credit \nIndices, \nBaskets \nand \nTranches. \nCredit \nderivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit \ndefault swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event \noccurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the \nprotection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is \ntypically a pro-rata portion of the transaction’s total \nnotional amount based on the underlying defaulted \nreference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk \nof a basket or index is separated into various portions \n(tranches), each having different levels of subordination. \nThe most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once \nlosses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, \nany excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche. \n• Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the \nrisks relating to economic performance of a reference \nobligation from the protection buyer to the protection \nseller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating \nrate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair \nvalue of the reference obligation, and the protection seller \nreceives the cash flows associated with the reference \nobligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the \nreference obligation. \nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit \nderivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased \ncredit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all \nof the firm’s purchased credit derivative transactions are with \nfinancial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral \nthresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified \ntrigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference \nobligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, \nand consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference \nobligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference \nobligations in the event of default. \nThe table below presents information about credit \nderivatives."

An interest rate swap is considered highly \neffective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to \nchanges in the hedged risk when the regression analysis \nresults in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater \nand a slope between 80% and 125%. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For \ncorporate loans and a majority of securities-based, real \nestate, other collateralized and other loans, the firm performs \ncredit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing \nevaluations of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to \nmeet its financial obligations. These credit evaluations are \nperformed on an annual basis or more frequently if deemed \nnecessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. \nThe firm determines an internal credit rating for the \nborrower by considering the results of the credit evaluations \nand assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook \nfor the borrower’s industry and the economic environment. \nFor \ncollateralized \nloans, \nthe \nfirm \nalso \ntakes \ninto \nconsideration collateral received or other credit support \narrangements when determining an internal credit rating.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n177\nAllowance for Credit Losses \nThe firm’s allowance for credit losses consists of the \nallowance for losses on loans and lending commitments \naccounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending \ncommitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at \nthe lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance \nfor credit losses. \nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at \namortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. \nThese portfolios represent the level at which the firm has \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to determine the \nallowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is \nmeasured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar \nrisk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an \nasset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics. \nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the \nweighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic \nconditions over the expected life of the loans and lending \ncommitments. The expected life of each loan or lending \ncommitment is determined based on the contractual term \nadjusted for extension options or demand features, or is \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The \nforecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic \nscenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss \ninformation based on a non-linear modeled approach. The \nforecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios \ndescribed below. The firm applies judgment in weighing \nindividual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of \nfactors, including the firm’s internally derived economic \noutlook, \nmarket \nconsensus, \nrecent \nmacroeconomic \nconditions and industry trends. \nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative \ncomponents which allow management to reflect the uncertain \nnature \nof \neconomic \nforecasting, \ncapture \nuncertainty \nregarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision \nand concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by \nmanagement include, among others, changes and trends in \nloan \nportfolios, \nuncertainties \nassociated \nwith \nthe \nmacroeconomic \nand \ngeopolitical \nenvironments, \ncredit \nconcentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due \nand criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration \nwithin an industry or region. \nManagement’s estimate of credit losses entails judgment \nabout the expected life of the loan and loan collectability at \nthe reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in \nthose judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to \na governance process that involves senior management within \nRisk and Controllers. Personnel within Risk are responsible \nfor forecasting the economic variables that underlie the \neconomic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected \ncredit losses. While management uses the best information \navailable to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the \nallowance may be necessary based on, among other things, \nchanges in the economic environment or variances between \nactual results and the original assumptions used. \nThe table below presents gross loans and lending \ncommitments accounted for at amortized cost by portfolio. \nAs of December\n2024\n2023\n$ in millions\nLoans\nLending\nCommitments\nLoans\nLending\nCommitments\nWholesale\nCorporate\n$ 28,689 $ \n156,562 \n$ 33,866 $ \n141,976 \nCommercial real estate"

These \nmodels determine the probability of default and loss given \ndefault based on various risk factors, including internal credit \nratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, \nmacroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet \nits financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and \nindustry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending \ncommitments, \nthe \nmethodology \nalso \nconsiders \nthe \nprobability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value \nratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most \nsignificant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans \nand lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, \ncredit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, \nshort- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices. \nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not \nshare similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is \ncalculated using the present value of expected future cash \nflows discounted at the loan’s effective rate, the observable \nmarket price of the loan, or, in the case of collateral \ndependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated \ncosts to sell, if applicable. Wholesale loans are charged off \nagainst the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be \nuncollectible.\nConsumer. The allowance for credit losses for consumer \nloans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated \nusing a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans \ninto pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related \ncharacteristics that differentiate a pool’s risk characteristics \nfrom other pools. The factors considered in determining a \npool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used \nfor internal credit risk measurement and management and \ninclude key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency \nstatus, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most \nsignificant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans \ninclude unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The \nexpected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing and amount \nof repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm does \nnot recognize an allowance for credit losses on credit card \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm. \nCredit card loans are charged off when they are 180 days past \ndue. Installment loans were charged off when they were 120 \ndays past due. \nAllowance for Credit Losses Rollforward \nThe table below presents information about the allowance \nfor credit losses. \n$ in millions\nWholesale Consumer \nTotal \nYear Ended December 2024\nAllowance for loan losses\nBeginning balance\n$ \n2,576 $ \n2,474 $ \n5,050 \nCharge-offs"

The primary reasons for \nelecting the fair value option are to: \n• Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis; \n• Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different \nmeasurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets \naccounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, \nwhereas the related secured financing would be recorded \non an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); \nand \n• Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations \n(e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair \nvalue in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded \nderivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts). \nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain \nbifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require \nsettlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., \nphysical commodities). Unless the firm has elected to account \nfor the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value under \nthe fair value option, the embedded derivative is bifurcated \nfrom the associated host contract, the derivative is accounted \nfor at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at \namortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair \nvalue hedges. \nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair \nvalue under the fair value option include: \n• Repurchase agreements and substantially all resale \nagreements; \n• Certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; \n• Certain customer and other receivables and certain other \nassets and liabilities; \n• Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are \nnot eligible for a fair value option election), including \nstructured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid \nfinancial instruments; \n• Substantially all other secured financings, including \nstructured financing arrangements and transfers of assets \naccounted for as financings; and \n• Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, \nsubstantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments. \nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value \nmeasurement policies, valuation techniques and significant \ninputs used to determine the fair value of other financial \nassets and liabilities, and Note 5 for information about other \nfinancial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.\nGains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and \nLiabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair \nValue Option \nThe table below presents the gains and losses recognized in \nearnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value \noption to certain financial assets and liabilities. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnsecured short-term borrowings\n$ (2,749) $ (4,341) $ 4,055 \nUnsecured long-term borrowings"

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n182\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nNote 11. \nCollateralized Agreements and Financings \nCollateralized agreements are resale agreements and \nsecurities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase \nagreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. \nThe firm enters into these transactions in order to, among \nother things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, \nacquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain \nfirm activities. \nCollateralized agreements and financings with the same \nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis \nwhen such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and \nare subject to netting agreements. Interest on collateralized \nagreements, which is included in interest income, and \ncollateralized financings, which is included in interest \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See \nNote 23 for further information about interest income and \ninterest expense. \nResale and Repurchase Agreements \nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm \npurchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in \nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an \nagreement to resell the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus \naccrued interest at a future date. \nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm \nsells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange \nfor cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to \nrepurchase the same or substantially the same financial \ninstruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued \ninterest at a future date. \nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including \n“repos- and reverses-to-maturity”) involve the legal transfer \nof ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for \nas financing arrangements because they require the financial \ninstruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial instruments \npurchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements \ntypically include U.S. government and agency obligations, \nand investment-grade sovereign obligations. \nThe firm receives financial instruments purchased under \nresale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments \nsold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit \nexposure, the firm monitors the market value of these \nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains \nadditional collateral due to changes in the market value of the \nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, \nthe firm typically requires collateral with a fair value \napproximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets. \nRepurchase \nagreements \nand \nsubstantially \nall \nresale \nagreements are recorded at fair value under the fair value \noption. See Note 5 for further information about repurchase \nand resale agreements.\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions \nIn a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows \nsecurities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or \nsecurities. When the firm returns the securities, the \ncounterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. \nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to \na counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the \ncounterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash \nor securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid \nperiodically over the life of the transaction. \nIn a transaction where the firm lends securities and receives \nsecurities that can be delivered or pledged as collateral, the \nfirm recognizes the securities received within securities \nborrowed and the obligation to return those securities within \nsecurities loaned in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of \nsecurities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm \nmonitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, \nand delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in \nthe market value of the securities, as appropriate. For \nsecurities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires \ncollateral with a fair value approximately equal to the \ncarrying value of the securities borrowed transaction. \nSecurities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are \nrecorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 \nfor further information about securities borrowed and loaned \naccounted for at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the securities borrowed and loaned within \nEquities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash \ncollateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The \nfirm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an \nallowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into \nconsideration the fair value of collateral received. As these \nagreements generally can be terminated on demand, they \nexhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. \nTherefore, \nthe \ncarrying \nvalue \nof \nsuch \nagreements \napproximates fair value. As these agreements are not \naccounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s \nfair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these agreements \nbeen included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would \nhave been classified in level 2 as of both December 2024 and \nDecember 2023.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

When \nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative \nassessment can be made to determine whether it is more \nlikely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting \nunit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the \nqualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative \ngoodwill test can be performed without performing a \nqualitative assessment.\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair \nvalue of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting \nunit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, \ngoodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the \nestimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its \ncarrying value and any such impairment is included in \ndepreciation and amortization. \nWhen performing a quantitative goodwill test, the estimated \nfair value of each reporting unit is based on valuation \ntechniques the firm believes market participants would use to \nvalue these reporting units. Estimated fair values are \ngenerally derived from utilizing a relative value technique, \nwhich applies observable price-to-earnings multiples or price-\nto-book multiples of comparable competitors to the reporting \nunits’ net earnings or net book value, or a discounted cash \nflow valuation approach, for reporting units with businesses \nin early stages of development. The carrying value of each \nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ \nequity and represents the estimated amount of total \nshareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the \nreporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital \nrequirements. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, in connection with the \nplanned sale of the firm’s seller financing loan portfolio, the \nfirm performed a quantitative goodwill test and determined \nthat the goodwill associated with Transaction banking and \nother was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a $14 million \nimpairment. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm performed its annual \nassessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of its \nreporting units with goodwill, by performing a qualitative \nassessment. Multiple factors were assessed with respect to \neach of these reporting units to determine whether it was \nmore likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of \nthose reporting units was less than its carrying value. \nThe firm considered the following factors in the qualitative \nannual assessment:\n• Performance Indicators. During 2024, the firm’s net \nrevenues, efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided \nby total net revenues), diluted earnings per common share \n(EPS), return on average common shareholders’ equity and \nbook value per common share all improved from 2023 and \nfrom 2022 (when a quantitative test was last performed). \nWithin the reporting units with goodwill, there continued \nto be solid fundamentals underlying our businesses, where \nthe firm continued to maintain industry leadership \npositions and execute on strategic goals.\n• Macroeconomic \nIndicators. \nDespite \nbroad \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, the global \neconomy continued to grow in 2024.\n• Firm and Industry Events. There were no events, entity-\nspecific or otherwise, that would have had a significant \nnegative impact on the valuation of the firm’s reporting \nunits with goodwill.  \n• Fair Value Indicators. Fair value indicators for both the \nfirm and its peers have generally improved since the annual \nassessment performed in 2023 and from 2022 (when a \nquantitative test was last performed).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For leases longer than \none year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing \nthe right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a \nlease liability representing the liability to make payments. \nThe lease term is generally determined based on the \ncontractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm \nhas the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment \nof the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into \nthe determination of the lease term. Such assessment is \ninitially performed at the inception of the lease and is \nupdated if events occur that impact the original assessment. \nAn operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined \nbased on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial \ndirect costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to \nlease commencement. This amount is then amortized over \nthe lease term. Right-of-use assets and operating lease \nliabilities recognized (in non-cash transactions for leases \nentered into or assumed) by the firm were $167 million for \n2024, $333  million for 2023 and $256  million for 2022. See \nNote 15 for information about operating lease liabilities. \nFor leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit \nfrom leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has \nshortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, \nthe firm will record an impairment or accelerated \namortization of right-of-use assets.

The firm acts as underwriter of the \nbeneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm’s \nresidential \nmortgage \nsecuritizations \nare \nprimarily \nin \nconnection with government agency securitizations. \nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has \nrelinquished control over the transferred financial assets. \nPrior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets \npending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically \nrecognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of \nassets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are \nrecognized in connection with the sales of the underlying \nbeneficial interests to investors.\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the \ntransferred assets but may also have continuing involvement \nwith the transferred financial assets, including ownership of \nbeneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in \nthe form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase \nsenior or subordinated securities issued by securitization \nvehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with \nsecondary market-making activities. \nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other \ninterests from the firm’s continuing involvement with \nsecuritization vehicles are the performance of the underlying \ncollateral, the position of the firm’s investment in the capital \nstructure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for \nthe security.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n194\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nNote 17. \nVariable Interest Entities \nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or \nequity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending \ncommitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE’s expected \nlosses and/or receive portions of the VIE’s expected residual \nreturns. \nThe firm’s variable interests in VIEs include senior and \nsubordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited \nand general partnership interests; preferred and common \nequity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity \nand/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm \nreceives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign \ncurrency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs \nare not variable interests because they create, rather than \nabsorb, risk. \nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt \nand equity securities that are either collateralized by or \nindexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity \nsecurities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying \nlevels of subordination. The firm’s involvement with VIEs \nincludes securitization of financial assets, as described in \nNote 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, \nas described below. See Note 3 for the firm’s consolidation \npolicies, including the definition of a VIE. \nVIE Consolidation Analysis \nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is \nknown as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. \nThe firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a \nVIE by performing an analysis that principally considers: \n• Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the \nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the \nVIE’s economic performance; \n• Which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb \nlosses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that \ncould potentially be significant to the VIE; \n• The VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE \nwas designed to create and pass through to its variable \ninterest holders; \n• The VIE’s capital structure; \n• The terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders \nand other parties involved with the VIE; and \n• Related-party relationships. \nThe firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a \nVIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm \nreassesses its determination of whether it is the primary \nbeneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current \nfacts and circumstances.\nVIE Activities \nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through the \nfollowing business activities: \nMortgage-Backed VIEs. The firm sells residential and \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-\nbacked VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets \nsold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with \nmarket-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into \nderivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate \nswaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm \ngenerally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to \nmitigate its risk. \nTax Credit and Other Investing VIEs. The firm makes \nequity investments in VIEs that invest in qualified affordable \nhousing and renewable energy projects designed to generate a \nreturn through the realization of tax credits and related tax \nbenefits. The firm also purchases equity and debt securities \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, \nperforming and nonperforming debt, distressed loans and \nequity securities. In addition, the firm makes equity \ninvestments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is \nentitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm generally \ndoes not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these \nVIEs. \nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The firm \nstructures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells \nbeneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs in connection with market-making activities, \nand makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. \nCertain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the \nbeneficial interests they issue by entering into credit \nderivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into \nderivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate \ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and \nreceives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-\nbacked loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the \ntotal return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these \nswaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and \nother asset-backed VIEs it structures. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n195\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs. The firm structures VIEs \nthat issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs \nown portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge \nfunds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the \nnotes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio \nrebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The \nfirm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under \nwhich the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-\nprotected note holders and receives the return on the assets \nowned by the VIE.

The firm’s commercial lending \ncommitments were primarily extended to investment-grade \ncorporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily included \n$148.78 billion as of December 2024 and $137.11 billion as of \nDecember 2023, related to relationship lending activities \n(principally used for operating and general corporate \npurposes), and $11.26 billion as of December 2024 and $4.21 \nbillion as of December 2023, related to other investment \nbanking activities (generally extended for contingent \nacquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term \nin nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other \nfunding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments \nin connection with other types of corporate lending, \ncommercial real estate financing and other collateralized \nlending. See Note 9 for further information about funded \nloans. \nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm’s \ncommercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit \nprotection on certain loans and lending commitments \nthrough credit default swaps, both single-name and index-\nbased contracts. \nWarehouse Financing. The firm provides financing to \nclients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements \nare collateralized by the warehoused assets, primarily \nconsisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate \nloans. \nConsumer. The firm’s consumer lending commitments \nincludes: \n• Credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers were \n$78.10 billion as of December 2024 and $70.82 billion as of \nDecember 2023. Such credit card lines included $14.32 \nbillion as of December 2024 and $14.35 billion as of \nDecember 2023 of commitments classified as held for sale \nin connection with the planned sale of the GM co-branded \ncredit card portfolio. These credit card lines are cancellable \nby the firm. \n• Commitments to provide unsecured installment loans to \nconsumers were $2.25  billion as of December 2023 and \nsuch commitments were classified as held for sale in \nconnection with the sale of GreenSky.

The firm enters into various \nderivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. \nGAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and \nswaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with \nderivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and \ntherefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the \nfirm’s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures \nabout derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled \nand the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments at the \ninception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these \nconditions have been met for certain large, internationally \nactive commercial and investment bank counterparties, \ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other \ncounterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such \ncontracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information \nabout credit derivatives that meet the definition of a \nguarantee, which are not included in the table above. \nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best indication of payment/\nperformance risk for individual contracts. However, the \ncarrying values in the table above exclude the effect of \ncounterparty and cash collateral netting. \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees. Securities \nlending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications \nand guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an \nagency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of \nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. \nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its \nsecurities lending customers against losses incurred in the \nevent that borrowers do not return securities and the \ncollateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the \nsecurities borrowed. The maximum payout of such \nindemnifications was $10.62 billion as of December 2024 and \n$14.19 billion as of December 2023. Collateral held by the \nlenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications \nwas $11.02 billion as of December 2024 and $14.63 billion as \nof December 2023. Because the contractual nature of these \narrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to \nthe borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated \nwith these indemnifications. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n200\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government Securities \nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm \nguarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients \nto the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with \ncertain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize \npotential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a \nsecurity interest in the collateral that the sponsored client \nplaced with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. \nTherefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. The \nmaximum payout on this guarantee was $47.44 billion as of \nDecember 2024 and $14.60 billion as of December 2023. The \nrelated collateral held was $46.96 billion as of December 2024 \nand $14.69 billion as of December 2023. \nOther Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary course of \nbusiness, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the \nobligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and \nother guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions \nand fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent \nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the \nguaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a \ncontractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Other \nfinancial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm \nhas provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will \nreceive, by August 2025, at least $1.4  billion in assets and \nproceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities \naround the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, \na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection \nwith this guarantee, the firm agreed to make a one-time \ninterim payment of $250 million towards the $1.4 billion if \nthe Government of Malaysia did not receive at least \n$500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022. The firm \ndoes not believe that any interim payment is required. Any \namounts paid by the firm would, in any event, be subject to \nreimbursement in the event the assets and proceeds received \nby the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 \nexceed $1.4 billion. \nOn October 11, 2023, the firm filed a demand for arbitration \nalleging that the Government of Malaysia had, as of August \n2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in excess of \n$500  million; it had recovered substantial additional assets \nand proceeds that should be credited against the guarantee; \nand it had not used all reasonable efforts to recover other \nassets and proceeds that could be credited against the \nguarantee. On November 8, 2023, the Government of \nMalaysia filed a response to the firm’s demand for arbitration \nand on June 10, 2024, filed an application for a partial award \nto immediately enforce the interim payment (plus interest). \nOn July 24, 2024, the arbitral tribunal rejected that \napplication. Final determinations on all remaining issues, \nincluding any subsequent enforcement of the interim \npayment, are to be made at a final hearing. The arbitral \nprocess is ongoing. See Note 27 for further information about \nmatters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The firm has \nestablished trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, \nGoldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (the \nTrusts), and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing \nsecurities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm \nand entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and \nthird parties related to this purpose. The firm does not \nconsolidate these entities. See Notes 14 and 19 for further \ninformation about the transactions involving the Trusts. \nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional \nguarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely \npayment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under \nthe guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related \ncontractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments \ndue on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of \nGroup Inc. guarantees the securities of the Trusts. \nManagement \nbelieves \nthat \nit \nis \nunlikely \nthat \nany \ncircumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part \nof paying agents or other service providers, that would make \nit necessary for the firm to make payments related to these \nentities other than those required under the terms of the \nguarantee, \nborrowing, \npreferred \nstock \nand \nrelated \ncontractual arrangements and in connection with certain \nexpenses incurred by these entities. \nIndemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers. In \nthe ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and \nguarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and \ncustody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified \npotential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, \nor providing services to, the firm or its affiliates. \nThe firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties \nfor losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or \nomissions of third-party service providers, including sub-\ncustodians and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm \nhas the right to seek indemnification from these third-party \nservice providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the \nfirm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing \nand settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges \naround the world that may require the firm to meet the \nobligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. \nIn connection with the firm’s prime brokerage and clearing \nbusinesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle transactions \nentered into by clients with other brokerage firms. The firm’s \nobligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the \nassets in the client’s account and proceeds received from the \ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the \nclient. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm \nmay issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the \nevent of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities \nand other matters involving the borrower. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n201\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum \npayout under these guarantees and indemnifications as this \ndepends upon the occurrence of future events, including an \nassessment of claims that have not yet occurred. However, \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to \nmake any material payments under these arrangements, and \nno material liabilities related to these guarantees and \nindemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated \nbalance sheets as of both December 2024 and December 2023. \nOther \nRepresentations, \nWarranties \nand \nIndemnifications. The firm provides representations and \nwarranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of \ncommercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them \nagainst potential losses caused by the breach of those \nrepresentations and warranties. The firm may also provide \nindemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse \napplication of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with \nordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, \nborrowings or derivatives. \nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some \ncounterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes \nare owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in \nor an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws. These \nindemnifications, as well as indemnifications provided by the \nfirm on other contractual or other obligations, generally are \nstandard contractual terms and are entered into in the \nordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or \nnotional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the \ncontingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not \nexpected to occur. Future changes in tax laws and how such \nlaws would apply to these indemnifications cannot be \ndetermined. Therefore, the firm is unable to develop an \nestimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and \nindemnifications. However, management believes that it is \nunlikely the firm will have to make any material payments \nunder these arrangements, and no material liabilities related \nto these arrangements have been recognized in the \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both December 2024 and \nDecember 2023. \nGuarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. is the entity that \nfully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by \nGS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the \nfirm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of \nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and \nGoldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain \nexceptions. Group Inc. also guarantees many of the \nobligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a \ntransaction-by-transaction \nbasis, \nas \nnegotiated \nwith \ncounterparties. In addition, Group Inc. has provided \nguarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSBE \nrelated to agreements that each entity has entered into with \ncertain of its counterparties. Given the obligations of the \nconsolidated subsidiaries are recognized in the consolidated \nbalance sheets or reflected as commitments, Group Inc.’s \nliabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed. \nNote 19. \nShareholders’ Equity \nCommon Equity \nAs of both December 2024 and December 2023, the firm had \n4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 \nmillion authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each \nwith a par value of $0.01 per share. \nThe firm’s share repurchase program is intended to help \nmaintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share \nrepurchase program is effected primarily through regular \nopen-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans \ndesigned to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which are \ndetermined primarily by the firm’s current and projected \ncapital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but \nwhich may also be influenced by the evolution of current and \nfuture regulatory capital requirements, general market \nconditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of \nthe firm’s common stock. \nThe table below presents information about common stock \nrepurchases. \nYear Ended December\nin millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommon share repurchases\n17.5\n16.8\n10.1\nAverage cost per share\n$ 457.82 $ 345.87 $ 346.07 \nTotal cost of common share repurchases\n$ 8,000 $ 5,796 $ 3,500 \nPursuant to the terms of certain share-based awards, \nemployees may remit shares to the firm or the firm may \ncancel share-based awards to satisfy statutory employee tax \nwithholding requirements.

The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory \ncapital requirements which are calculated in accordance with \nthe regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). \nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital \nand leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory \ncapital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these \ncapital requirements would result in restrictions being \nimposed by the firm’s regulators and could limit the firm’s \nability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain \ndiscretionary compensation payments. The firm’s capital \nlevels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the \nregulators about components of capital, risk weightings and \nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm’s subsidiaries \nare subject to separate regulations and capital requirements. \nCapital Framework \nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largely \nbased on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s \n(Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening \ninternational capital standards (Basel III) and also implement \ncertain provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Under the Capital \nFramework, the firm is an “Advanced approaches” banking \norganization and has been designated as a global systemically \nimportant bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based \ncapital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The \nbuffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as \nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. \nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total \ncapital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and \nAdvanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios calculated under \nthe Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet its \nrespective capital requirements. \nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to \nleverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 \nleverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio \n(SLR), as well as the SLR buffer. \nConsolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements \nRisk-Based Capital Ratios.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with both the \nStandardized and Advanced Capital Rules. \nCredit Risk \nCredit RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure, \nwhich are then risk weighted under the Standardized and \nAdvanced Capital Rules: \n• The Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed risk-\nweights, which depend largely on the type of counterparty. \nThe exposure measures for derivatives and securities \nfinancing transactions are based on specific formulas which \ntake certain factors into consideration. \n• Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-\nweights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in \naccordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based \napproach. The exposure measures for derivatives and \nsecurities financing transactions are computed utilizing \ninternal models. \n• For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the \nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on \nspecific required formulaic approaches. \nMarket Risk \nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized \nand Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market \nRWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which \ninclude the following: \n• Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading \nassets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, \nand other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at \nfair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined \ntime horizon with a specified confidence level.\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital \ncalculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which \ncaptures risks, including those related to interest rates, \nequity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. \nHowever, VaR used for risk management purposes differs \nfrom VaR used for regulatory capital requirements \n(regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, \nconfidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR \nis calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95% one-\nday VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital \nrequirements, a 99% 10-day VaR is used to determine \nMarket RWAs and a 99% one-day VaR is used to \ndetermine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily \nnet revenues used to determine risk management VaR \nexceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the \nVaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business \nday) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital \nFramework requires that intraday activity be excluded \nfrom daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR \nexceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net \nrevenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by \ntheir nature. As a result, there may be differences in the \nnumber of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net \nrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the \namounts calculated for risk management VaR. \nThe firm’s positional losses observed on a single day \nexceeded its 99% one-day regulatory VaR on two \noccasions during 2024 and on one occasion during 2023. \nThere was no change in the firm’s VaR multiplier used to \ncalculate Market RWAs; \n• Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets \nand liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and \nother financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair \nvalue, during a period of significant market stress; \n• Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-\nsecuritized positions due to the default or credit migration \nof issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time \nhorizon; \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n208\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nGS Bank USA \nGS Bank USA is the firm’s primary U.S. bank subsidiary. GS \nBank USA is a New York State-chartered bank and a member \nof the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by \nthe FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of \nFinancial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau (CFPB), and is subject to regulatory capital \nrequirements that are calculated under the Capital \nFramework. GS Bank USA is an “Advanced approaches” \nbanking organization under the Capital Framework. The \ndeposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the \nextent provided by law. \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based \ncapital and the capital conservation buffer requirements \n(consisting of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital \nbuffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that \nqualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital \nFramework includes the leverage ratio requirement. GS Bank \nUSA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital \nand Total capital ratios in accordance with both the \nStandardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each \nrisk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced \nCapital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA’s \ncompliance with its risk-based capital requirements is \nassessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for \nprompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in \norder to meet the quantitative requirements for a “well-\ncapitalized” depository institution, GS Bank USA must also \nmeet the “well-capitalized” requirements in the table below. \nGS Bank USA’s capital levels and prompt corrective action \nclassification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the \nregulators about components of capital, risk weightings and \nother \nfactors. \nFailure \nto \ncomply \nwith \nthe \ncapital \nrequirements, including a breach of the buffers described \nbelow, would result in restrictions being imposed by the \nregulators. \nThe table below presents GS Bank USA’s risk-based capital, \nleverage and “well-capitalized” requirements. \nAs of December"

Net interest is included in segment \nnet revenues as it is consistent with how management \nassesses segment performance. \n• Expenses not directly associated with specific segments are \nallocated among the business segments based on an \nestimate of support provided to each segment. \n• Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm’s segments \nreflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the \nfirm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. \nConsequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm’s \nbusiness may be significantly affected by the performance \nof the firm’s other business segments.\n• Certain assets (including allocations of global core liquid \nassets and cash, and secured client financing), not directly \nassociated with specific segments are generally allocated \namong the business segments based on the funding and \nliquidity requirements of the segments. \n• Common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock \ndividends are allocated to each segment based on the \nestimated amount of equity required to support the \nactivities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital \nrequirements. \n• Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the \nfirmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax earnings. \n• Management believes that this allocation provides a \nreasonable representation of each segment’s contribution \nto consolidated net earnings to common, return on average \ncommon equity and total assets. Due to the integrated \nnature of these segments, estimates and judgments are \nmade in allocating these assets, revenues and expenses. \nTransactions between segments are based on specific \ncriteria or approximate third-party rates.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These activities expose the firm \nto many different industries and counterparties, and may also \nsubject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a \nparticular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, \nincluding sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearinghouse \nor exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively \nmonitoring \nexposures \nand \nobtaining \ncollateral \nfrom \ncounterparties as deemed appropriate. \nThe firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on \namounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk \nmitigants that the firm considers when determining credit \nrisk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral \narrangements and economic hedges, such as credit \nderivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and \ncollateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and \npayables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to \nobtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis. \nThe table below presents the credit concentrations included \nin trading cash instruments and investments."

Many of these proceedings are in early \nstages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate \namount of damages. \nUnder ASC 450, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the \nchance of the future event or events occurring is more than \nremote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the \nchance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” \nThus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably \npossible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a \nrange of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the \nrange of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of \nloss is more than slight.\nWith respect to matters described below for which \nmanagement has been able to estimate a range of reasonably \npossible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nclaimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, \nor threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering \nand is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes \nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the \npurchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, \nmanagement has estimated the upper end of the range of \nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the case of (i), the \namount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the \ndifference between the initial sales price of the securities that \nthe firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest \nsubsequent price of such securities prior to the action being \ncommenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that \npurchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if \nany, as of December 2024 of the relevant securities, in each of \ncases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors \nbelieved to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of \nthat type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the \nupper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss \nfor such matters and for any other matters described below \nwhere management has been able to estimate a range of \nreasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately \n$1.7  billion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such \nmatters. \nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range of \nreasonably possible loss for matters other than those included \nin the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential \nplaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, \nexcept in those instances where management can otherwise \ndetermine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early \nstages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or \nreviews, except in those instances where management can \notherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is \nuncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or \nthe ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the \noutcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are \nsignificant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are \nnovel legal issues presented. For example, the firm’s potential \nliabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews \ndescribed below in “Regulatory Investigations and Reviews \nand Related Litigation” generally are not included in \nmanagement’s estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, \nmanagement does not believe, based on currently available \ninformation, that the outcomes of such other matters will \nhave a material adverse effect on the firm’s financial \ncondition, though the outcomes could be material to the \nfirm’s operating results for any particular period, depending, \nin part, upon the operating results for such period. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On August 28, 2018, Leissner \nwas adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money \nand to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s \n(FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls \nprovisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder \nmoney and to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery and internal \naccounting controls provisions, and on April 8, 2022, Ng was \nfound guilty on all counts following a trial. \nOn August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a \nsettlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to \nresolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia \ninvolving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the \nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $1.4 billion in \nassets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental \nauthorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 \nfor further information about this guarantee, including \nrelated arbitration proceedings. \nOn October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached \nsettlements of governmental and regulatory investigations \nrelating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the \nNYDFS, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential \nRegulation Authority, the Singapore Attorney General’s \nChambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, \nthe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong \nSecurities and Futures Commission.

The plaintiff filed the second \namended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, \nthe court dismissed the claims against one of the individual \ndefendants but denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with \nrespect to the firm and the remaining individual defendants. \nOn August 4, 2023, the plaintiff filed a third amended \ncomplaint. On September 29, 2023, the plaintiff moved for \nclass certification. On April 5, 2024, the Magistrate Judge \nrecommended \nthat \nthe \nplaintiff’s \nmotion \nfor \nclass \ncertification be granted in part and denied in part. On May 3, \n2024, the defendants filed objections to the Magistrate \nJudge’s report and recommendation with the district court.\nMortgage-Related Matters \nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, \n2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS \nMortgage \nSecurities \nCorp. \nby \nU.S. \nBank \nNational \nAssociation, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed \nsecuritization trusts that issued $1.7 billion of securities. The \ncomplaints generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts \nfailed to conform to applicable representations and \nwarranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, \ncompensatory damages and other relief. On November 23, \n2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the complaint in the first action and denied \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the second \naction. On January 14, 2021, amended complaints were filed \nin both actions. \nCurrencies-Related Litigation \nGS&Co. is among the defendants named in a putative class \naction filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York on August 4, 2021. The amended \ncomplaint, filed on January 6, 2022, generally asserts claims \nunder federal antitrust law and state common law in \nconnection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants \nto manipulate auctions for foreign exchange transactions on \nan electronic trading platform, as well as claims under the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The \ncomplaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as \nunspecified amounts of treble and other damages. On May \n18, 2023, the court dismissed certain state common law \nclaims, but denied dismissal of the remaining claims. On July \n7, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(Oak Finance), a special purpose \nvehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco \nEspirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In \nresponse, GSI and, with respect to the BoP’s December 2015 \ndecision, GSIB commenced actions beginning in February \n2015 against Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the English \nCommercial Court and the BoP in the Portuguese \nAdministrative Court. In July 2018, the English Supreme \nCourt found that the English courts will not have jurisdiction \nover GSI’s action unless and until the Portuguese \nAdministrative Court finds against BoP in GSI’s parallel \naction. In July 2018, the Liquidation Committee for BES \nissued a decision seeking to claw back from GSI $54 million \npaid to GSI and $50 million allegedly paid to Oak Finance in \nconnection with the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in bad \nfaith in extending the Facility, including because GSI \nallegedly knew that BES was at risk of imminent failure. In \nOctober 2018, GSI commenced an action in the Lisbon \nCommercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee’s \ndecision and has since also issued a claim against the \nPortuguese State seeking compensation for losses of \napproximately $222 million related to the failure of BES, \ntogether with a contingent claim for the $104 million sought \nby the Liquidation Committee. On April 11, 2023, GSI \ncommenced administrative proceedings against the BoP, \nseeking the nullification of the BoP’s September 2015 and \nDecember 2015 decisions on new grounds.\nFinancial Advisory Services \nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time \nparties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings \nand other disputes with clients and third parties relating to \nthe firm’s financial advisory activities.

In addition to the underwriters, the defendants include \nViacomCBS and certain of its officers and directors. GS&Co. \nunderwrote 646,154 shares of common stock representing an \naggregate offering price of approximately $55 million and \n323,077 shares of preferred stock representing an aggregate \noffering price of approximately $32 million. The complaint \nasserts claims under the federal securities laws and alleges \nthat \nthe \noffering \ndocuments \ncontained \nmaterial \nmisstatements and omissions, including, among other things, \nthat the offering documents failed to disclose that Archegos \nCapital Management, LP (Archegos) had substantial \nexposure to ViacomCBS, including through total return \nswaps to which certain of the underwriters (the trading \nunderwriters), \nincluding \nGS&Co., \nwere \nallegedly \ncounterparties, and that such underwriters failed to disclose \ntheir exposure to Archegos. On December 21, 2021, the \nplaintiffs filed a corrected amended complaint. The \ncomplaint seeks rescission and compensatory damages in \nunspecified amounts. On February 6, 2023, the trial court \ndismissed the claims against ViacomCBS and the individual \ndefendants, but denied the defendants’ motions to dismiss \nwith respect to GS&Co. and the other underwriter \ndefendants. On January 4, 2024, the trial court granted the \nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and on February 14, \n2024, the underwriter defendants appealed. On April 4, 2024, \nthe Appellate Division for the First Department affirmed the \ntrial court’s dismissal of the claims against ViacomCBS and \nthe individual defendants, reversed the trial court’s failure to \ndismiss the claims against the non-trading underwriter \ndefendants, and affirmed the trial court’s denial of the \nmotion to dismiss claims against the trading underwriter \ndefendants, including GS&Co. \nGroup Inc. is also a defendant in putative securities class \nactions filed beginning in October 2021 and consolidated in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork. The complaints allege that Group Inc., along with \nanother financial institution, sold shares in Baidu Inc. \n(Baidu), Discovery Inc. (Discovery), GSX Techedu Inc. \n(Gaotu), iQIYI Inc.

The complaints generally assert violations of \nSections 10(b), 20A and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seek \nunspecified damages. In May 2023, the plaintiffs in the class \nactions filed second amended complaints, and on March 28, \n2024, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the \nsecond amended complaints with prejudice. On April 26, \n2024, the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The complaints in the \nindividual actions also assert claims under state antitrust law. \nThe complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well \nas treble damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants \nmoved to dismiss the class and the first individual action and \nthe district court dismissed the state common law claims \nasserted by the plaintiffs in the first individual action and \notherwise limited the state common law claim in the putative \nclass action and the antitrust claims in both actions to the \nperiod from 2013 to 2016.

On March 13, 2019, the court denied the \nplaintiffs’ motion in the putative class action to amend their \ncomplaint to add allegations related to conduct from 2008 to \n2012, but granted the motion to add limited allegations from \n2013 to 2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth \nconsolidated amended complaint filed on March 22, 2019. \nOn December 15, 2023, the court denied the plaintiffs’ \nmotion for class certification, and on December 28, 2023, the \nplaintiffs filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit seeking interlocutory review of the district \ncourt’s denial of class certification.

On \nMarch 29, 2020, the court granted the defendants’ motions to \ndismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in the dismissal of \nall claims, and on February 27, 2023, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court’s \ndismissal of certain plaintiffs’ antitrust claims and vacated \nthe district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ Commodity \nExchange Act claim.

On October 25, 2021, the court \ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice. On \nNovember 10, 2022, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ \nmotion for an indicative ruling that the judgment should be \nvacated because the wife of the district judge owned stock in \none of the defendants and the district judge did not recuse \nhimself.

The firm also provides certain benefits to former \nor inactive employees prior to retirement. \nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement \nPlans\nEmployees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries participate in \nvarious defined benefit pension plans. These plans generally \nprovide benefits based on years of credited service and a \npercentage of eligible compensation. The firm maintains a \ndefined benefit pension plan for certain U.K. employees. As \nof April 2008, the U.K. defined benefit plan was closed to \nnew participants and frozen for existing participants as of \nMarch 31, 2016. The non-U.S. plans do not have a material \nimpact on the firm’s consolidated results of operations. \nThe firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for \nsubstantially all U.S. employees hired prior to November 1, \n2003. As of November 2004, this plan was closed to new \nparticipants and frozen for existing participants. In addition, \nthe firm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit plans \nthat provide medical and life insurance for eligible retirees \nand their dependents covered under these programs. These \nplans do not have a material impact on the firm’s \nconsolidated results of operations.\nThe firm recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit \npension and postretirement plans, measured as the difference \nbetween the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit \nobligation, in the consolidated balance sheets. As of \nDecember 2024, other assets included $73 million (related to \noverfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included \n$344  million related to these plans. As of December 2023, \nother assets included $93  million (related to overfunded \npension plans) and other liabilities included $449  million \nrelated to these plans. \nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe firm contributes to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-\nU.S. defined contribution plans.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n230\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nNote 29.  \nEmployee Incentive Plans\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for a \nshare-based award is generally measured based on the grant-\ndate fair value of the award. Share-based awards that do not \nrequire future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards \ngranted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require future service \nare amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are \nrecorded when they occur. \nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future \nservice are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents \noriginally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to \ncompensation expense in the period in which forfeiture \noccurs.\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon \ndelivery of share-based awards. In limited cases, as outlined \nin the applicable award agreements, the firm may cash settle \nshare-based awards accounted for as equity instruments. For \nthese awards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the \nextent of the difference between the value of the award at the \ntime of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the \naward. The tax effect related to the settlement of share-based \nawards and payments of dividend equivalents is recorded in \nincome tax benefit or expense. \nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman \nSachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) \n(2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted \nstock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, \nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and \nother share-based awards, each of which may be subject to \nterms and conditions, including performance or market \nconditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the \n2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor \nstock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted on April \n30, 1999, and each of which was approved by the firm’s \nshareholders.\nAs of December 2024, 55.7 million shares were available to be \ndelivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If \nany shares of common stock underlying awards granted \nunder the 2021 SIP or awards granted under predecessor \nstock incentive plans are not delivered because such awards \nare forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common \nstock underlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to \nsatisfy any obligation of the grantee (including taxes), those \nshares will become available to be delivered pursuant to \nawards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be \ndelivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment \nfor certain events or changes in corporate structure as \nprovided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to \nterminate on the date of the 2025 Annual Meeting of \nShareholders.\nRestricted Stock Units \nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to \nperformance or market conditions) to employees, which are \ngenerally valued based on the closing price of the underlying \nshares on the date of grant, after taking into account a \nliquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery \ntransfer restrictions. The value of equity awards also \nconsiders the impact of material non-public information, if \nany, that the firm expects to make available shortly following \ngrant. RSUs not subject to performance or market conditions \ngenerally vest and underlying shares of common stock are \ndelivered (net of required withholding tax) over a three-year \nperiod as outlined in the applicable award agreements. \nAward agreements generally provide that vesting is \naccelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, \ndeath, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. \nDelivery of the underlying shares of common stock is \nconditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and \nother requirements outlined in the award agreements. \nRSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions \ngenerally are settled after the end of a three- to five-year \nperiod. For awards that are subject to performance or market \nconditions, generally the final award is adjusted from zero up \nto 150% of the original grant based on the extent to which \nthose conditions are satisfied. Dividend equivalents that \naccrue on these awards are paid when the awards settle. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(Fully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.) \n62\nExhibit 4.1\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following is a brief description of the material terms of the Company’s common stock. The following \nsummary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of \nthe Company’s restated certificate of incorporation and the Company’s amended and restated by-laws, which \nare exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all \nreferences to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not \ninclude its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation, the Company’s authorized capital stock \nconsists of 4,350,000,000 shares, each with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which 4,000,000,000 shares are \ndesignated as common stock and 200,000,000 shares are designated as nonvoting common stock. All \noutstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its \nholders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional \nfunds.\nThe Company’s Shareholders’ Agreement governs, among other things, the voting of shares of common stock \nowned by participating managing directors of the Company. Shares of common stock subject to the Company’s \nShareholders’ Agreement are called “voting shares.” Before any of the Company’s shareholders vote, a \nseparate, preliminary vote is held by the persons covered by the Company’s Shareholders’ Agreement. In the \nelection of directors, all voting shares will be voted in favor of the election of the director nominees receiving the \nhighest numbers of votes cast by the covered persons in the preliminary vote. For all other matters, all voting \nshares will be voted in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the covered persons in the preliminary \nvote.\nCommon Stock\nEach holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to \na vote of shareholders. There are no cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, the holders of a plurality of the \nshares of common stock voting in a contested election of directors can elect all the directors if they choose to \ndo so, subject to any voting rights of holders of preferred stock to elect directors. In an uncontested director \nelection, a director must receive a majority of the votes cast for or against the director to be elected.\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of \ncommon stock, together with the holders of the nonvoting common stock, are entitled to such dividends and \ndistributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared from time to time by the Company’s \nboard of directors from legally available funds. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of any outstanding \nseries of preferred stock, upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment of all \nprior claims, the holders of common stock, with the shares of the common stock and the nonvoting common \nstock being considered as a single class for this purpose, will be entitled to receive pro rata all the Company’s \nassets. Holders of common stock have no redemption or conversion rights or preemptive rights to purchase or \nsubscribe for securities of the Company.\nNonvoting Common Stock\nThe nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as, ranks equally and shares proportionately \nwith, and is identical in all respects as to all matters to, the common stock, except that the nonvoting common \nstock has no voting rights other than those voting rights required by law.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, \nSection 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an \n“interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became \n-2-\nan interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business \ncombination” includes a merger, asset sale or a transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested \nstockholder. An “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in \ncertain cases, within the preceding three years, did own) 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting \nstock. Under Section 203, a business combination between the Company and an interested stockholder is \nprohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n•\nprior to the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the \nCompany must have previously approved either the business combination or the transaction \nthat resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n•\non consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested \nstockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the \nCompany outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of \ndetermining the number of shares outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by \nthe interested stockholder), those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also \nofficers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to \ndetermine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or \nexchange offer; or\n•\nat or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors \nand authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by \nthe affirmative vote of at least 66 2⁄3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by \nthe interested stockholder.\nThe Company’s board of directors has adopted a resolution providing that the shareholders’ agreement will not \ncreate an “interested stockholder.”\nCertain Anti-Takeover Matters\nThe Company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of \nprovisions that may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other \nunilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with the Company’s board of directors rather than pursue non-\nnegotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include:\nConstituency Provision\nIn accordance with the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation, a director of the Company may (but is \nnot required to) in taking any action (including an action that may involve or relate to a change or potential \nchange in control of the Company), consider, among other things, the effects that the Company’s actions may \nhave on other interests or persons (including its employees, former partners of The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. \nand the community) in addition to the Company’s shareholders.\nAdvance Notice Requirements\nThe Company’s amended and restated by-laws establish advance notice procedures with regard to \nshareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be \nbrought before meetings of shareholders of the Company. These procedures provide that notice of such \nshareholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the Secretary of the Company prior to the meeting at \nwhich the action is to be taken. The time periods vary depending on the nature of the proposal. The notice must \ncontain certain information specified in the amended and restated by-laws and must otherwise comply with the \namended and restated by-laws.\nLimitation on Ability of Shareholders to Call Special Meetings\nThe Company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide procedures \npursuant to which holders of record of not less than 25% of the voting power of outstanding shares of the \n-3-\nCompany’s common stock may call a special meeting of shareholders. The Company’s amended and restated \nby-laws impose certain procedural requirements on shareholders requesting such a meeting (including the \nprovision of the same information required for shareholder proposals at annual meetings under the Company’s \nadvance notice by-law provisions described above), as well as qualifications designed to prevent duplicative \nand unnecessary meetings.\nNo Written Consent of Shareholders\nThe Company’s restated certificate of incorporation requires all shareholder actions to be taken by a vote of the \nshareholders at an annual or special meeting, and does not permit the Company’s shareholders to act by \nwritten consent without a meeting.\nBlank Check Preferred Stock\nThe Company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides for 150,000,000 authorized shares of preferred \nstock. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable the board of directors to \nrender more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, \ntender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the \nboard of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of the Company, the \nboard of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without shareholder approval in one or \nmore private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquiror \nor insurgent shareholder or shareholder group. In this regard, the restated certificate of incorporation grants the \nCompany’s board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued \nshares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings \nand assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also adversely \naffect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of such holders and may have the effect of delaying, \ndeterring or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nListing\nThe common stock of the Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “GS.”\n-4-\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1/1,000TH INTEREST IN A \nSHARE OF FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES A\nDESCRIPTION OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK\nThe depositary is the sole holder of the Company’s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A \n(the “Series A Preferred Stock”), and all references herein to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall \nmean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to \nexercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, as described below under \n“Description of Depositary Shares.”\nThe following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. The following \nsummary of the terms and provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is \nqualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company’s restated certificate of \nincorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context \notherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, \nInc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\nGeneral\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per \nshare. The Series A Preferred Stock is part of a single series of the Company’s authorized preferred stock. The \nCompany may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, \nissue additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued \nshares.\nShares of the Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company’s common stock, equally with each other \nseries of the Company’s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally to each \nother series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued \nwith the requisite consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of \ndividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will \ngenerally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of \nlawfully available funds for such payment (i.e., after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity \nclaims). The Series A Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid \ntheir purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of \nSeries A Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of \nstock or other securities of the Company, except under certain limited circumstances described below under “— \nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy.” The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is \nnot subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series A \nPreferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and \nis not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a \nbank.\nDividends\nDividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock \nare entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors or a duly authorized \ncommittee of the board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-\ncumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10th day of February, May, \nAugust and November of each year (each, a “dividend payment date”). These dividends accrue, with respect to \neach dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per \ndepositary share) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 0.75% above LIBOR (as described below) on \n-5-\nthe related LIBOR determination date (as described below) or (2) 3.75%. In the event that the Company issues \nadditional shares of Series A Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may \naccrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares \nare issued.\nDividends will be payable to holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company’s \nbooks on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that dividend payment date or \nsuch other record date fixed by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) \nthat is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a “dividend record \ndate”). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a \nbusiness day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for \nthe Series A Preferred Stock.\nA dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend \npayment date. Dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year \nand the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise \nbe payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day \nunless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the \nimmediately preceding day that is a business day.\nFor any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business \nday immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner:\n•\nLIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning \non the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of \n11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first \nday of such dividend period.\n•\nIf the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750, LIBOR will be \ndetermined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second \nLondon business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which \ndeposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by \nfour major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent: three-month deposits in \nU.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative \nAmount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks \nto provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second \nLondon business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the \narithmetic mean of the quotations.\n•\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London \nbusiness day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic \nmean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at \napproximately 11:00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day \nimmediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York \nCity selected by the calculation agent: three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first \nday of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount.\n•\nIf fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, \nLIBOR for the new dividend period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior dividend period.\n•\nUnder the Federal Reserve System’s (“FRB”) final rule and the Adjustable Interest Rate Act (“LIBOR \nAct”), on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR was replaced with three-month term \nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread, with three-month term \nSOFR determined by the calculation agent on the second U.S. government securities business day \nimmediately preceding the first day of the applicable dividend period.\n-6-\nThe calculation agent’s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for \nany dividend period, will be on file at the Company’s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder \nupon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.\nThis subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms \nhave the following meanings:\nThe term “Representative Amount” means an amount that, in the calculation agent’s judgment, is \nrepresentative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.\nThe term “Moneyline Telerate Page” means the display on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, \non the page or pages specified herein or any replacement page or pages on that service.\nThe term “business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a \nday on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive \norder to close.\nThe term “London business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and \nis a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.\nDividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the \nCompany, or a duly authorized committee of the board, does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred \nStock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will \nnot accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend \npayment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are declared for \nany future dividend period.\nSo long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on \nthe Company’s common stock or any other shares of the Company’s junior stock (as defined below) (other than \na dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, \nredeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result \nof a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of \njunior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a \nsubstantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the \nlatest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been declared and \npaid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing \nprovision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company’s other affiliates, to \nengage in any market-making transactions in the Company’s junior stock in the ordinary course of business.\nAs used in this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, “junior stock” means any class or series of stock of \nthe Company that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to the \ndistribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes the \nCompany’s common stock.\nWhen dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity \nstock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to \nthe Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the \nSeries A Preferred Stock) in full upon the Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends \ndeclared upon the Series A Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend \npayment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend \npayment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related \ndividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of \nsuch dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the \nSeries A Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity \n-7-\nstock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A \nPreferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred \nStock) bear to each other.\nAs used in this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, “parity stock” means any other class or series of \nstock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in \nthe distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nSubject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the \nCompany’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the \nCompany’s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock \nfrom time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series A Preferred \nStock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series A \nPreferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, \nafter satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common \nstock or of any of the Company’s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of \nSeries A Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per \ndepositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. \nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they \nhave received their full liquidation preference.\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full \nto all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company’s stock \nranking equally as to such distribution with the Series A Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of \nSeries A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the \nrespective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the “liquidation \npreference” of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, \nincluding any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any \nholder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in \nfull to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Company’s other stock shall be entitled to \nreceive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences.\nFor purposes of this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company \nwith any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock \nreceive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of \nthe assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or \nwinding up of the Company.\nRedemption\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar \nprovisions. The Series A Preferred Stock is currently redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, \nupon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share \n(equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any \nundeclared dividends. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or \nrepurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nIf shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first-\nclass mail to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 \ndays nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if the depositary \n-8-\nshares representing the Series A Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust \nCompany, or “DTC,” the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of \nredemption will include a statement setting forth: (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of the Series \nA Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the \nnumber of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places \nwhere holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock for payment of the \nredemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been given and if the \nfunds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any \nshares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, \ndividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of Series A Preferred \nStock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except \nthe right to receive the redemption price.\nIn case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the \nshares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may \ndetermine to be fair and equitable.\nSee “Description of Depositary Shares” below for information about redemption of the depositary shares \nrelating to the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock.\nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy\nThe SEC had previously approved the application of the Company and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to be \nsupervised by the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity (“CSE”) pursuant to the SEC’s rules at that time \nrelating to CSEs (referred to as the “CSE Rules”). The Company treated the Series A Preferred Stock as \nallowable capital in accordance with the CSE Rules (such capital is referred to below as “Allowable Capital”).\nIf the regulatory capital requirements that apply to the Company change in the future, the Series A Preferred \nStock may be converted, at the Company’s option and without consent of the holders, into a new series of \npreferred stock, subject to the limitations described below. The Company will be entitled to exercise this \nconversion right as follows.\nIf both of the following occur:\n•\nthe Company (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or \nguidance (together, “regulations”) relating to the Company’s capital adequacy, which \nregulation (i) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital, (ii) \nprovides for a type or level of capital characterized as “Tier 1” or its equivalent pursuant to \nregulations of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company (or any of the \nCompany’s subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing capital standards \npublished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the SEC, the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) or any other United States \nnational governmental body, or any other applicable regime based on capital standards \npublished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its successor, or (iii) provides for \na type of capital that in the Company’s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized \nstanding) is substantially equivalent to such “Tier 1” capital (such capital described in either (ii) \nor (iii) is referred to below as “Tier 1 Capital Equivalent”), and\n•\nthe Company affirmatively elects to qualify the Series A Preferred Stock for such Allowable \nCapital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment without any sublimit or other quantitative \nrestriction on the inclusion of the Series A Preferred Stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 \nCapital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation \nrequiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant \nform of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such regulations,\nthen, upon such affirmative election, the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the Company’s option \ninto a new series of preferred stock having terms and provisions substantially identical to those of the Series A \nPreferred Stock, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, \n-9-\nprivileges and voting powers, and such limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary, in the Company’s \njudgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), to comply with the Required Unrestricted \nCapital Provisions (defined below), provided that the Company will not cause any such conversion unless the \nCompany determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of such new series of preferred \nstock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. For example, the Company \ncould agree to restrict its ability to pay dividends on or redeem the new series of preferred stock for a specified \nperiod or indefinitely, to the extent permitted by the terms and provisions of the new series of preferred stock, \nsince such a restriction would be permitted in the Company’s discretion under the terms and provisions of the \nSeries A Preferred Stock.\nThe Company will provide notice to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of any election to qualify the Series \nA Preferred Stock for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to \nconvert the Series A Preferred Stock into a new series of preferred stock, promptly upon the effectiveness of \nany such election or determination. A copy of any such notice and of the relevant regulations will be on file at \nthe Company’s principal offices and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder.\nAs used above, the term “Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions” means the terms that are, in the \nCompany’s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be \ntreated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other \nquantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent \n(other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a \nspecified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) \npursuant to applicable regulations.\nVoting Rights\nExcept as provided below, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for \nthe equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in \nthis section, a “Nonpayment”), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all \nother series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election \nof a total of two additional members of the Company’s board of directors (as used in this section, the “Preferred \nStock Directors”), provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Company to violate the \ncorporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the \nCompany’s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. In \nthat event, the number of directors on the Company’s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, \nand the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at \nleast 20% of the Series A Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request \nis received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in \nwhich event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each \nsubsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series A \nPreferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four dividend periods, whether or not \nconsecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the \npayment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment).\nAs used in this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, “voting preferred stock” means any other class or \nseries of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series A Preferred Stock either as to \ndividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting \nrights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of \nSeries A Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be \ndetermined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted.\n-10-\nIf and when dividends for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment \nhave been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the \nholders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in \nthe event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred \nstock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the \nnumber of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether \ndividends have been paid for four dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Company may take account of \nany dividend the Company elects to pay for such a dividend period after the regular dividend date for that \nperiod has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of \nrecord of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights \ndescribed above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long \nas a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the \ninitial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director \nremaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the \noutstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting \ntogether as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). The Preferred Stock Directors \nshall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the \naffirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series A \nPreferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a \nsingle class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting:\n•\namend or alter the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so as to \nauthorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking \nsenior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution \nof assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company;\n•\namend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so \nas to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting \npowers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; or\n•\nconsummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred \nStock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) \nthe shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger \nor consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are \nconverted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its \nultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as \nthe case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a \nwhole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;\nprovided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or \nauthorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of \nother series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to \nthe payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of \nassets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the \nspecial rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, any \nconversion of the Series A Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events, as discussed \nabove under “—\n Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy,” will not be deemed to adversely affect \nthe special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nIf an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above \nwould adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series A Preferred \nStock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such \nseries of preferred stock.\n-11-\nWithout the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely \naffect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a \nwhole, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series A Preferred Stock:\n•\nto cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the \ncertificate of designation for the Series A Preferred Stock that may be defective or \ninconsistent; or\n•\nto make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series A \nPreferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such \nvote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall \nhave been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside \nby the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.\nDESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES\nPlease note that as used in this section, references to “holders” of depositary shares mean those who own \ndepositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for \nthis purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street \nname or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company.\nGeneral\nThe Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each \nrepresenting a 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock and evidenced by a \ndepositary receipt. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited \nunder a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the \ndepositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each \nholder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share \nof Series A Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the \nSeries A Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\nDividends and Other Distributions\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited \nSeries A Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series A Preferred \nStock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any \nproperty received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, \nunless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not \nfeasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company’s approval, sell the property \nand distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the \nnumber of depositary shares they hold.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same \nas the corresponding record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be \nwithheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\nIf the Company redeems the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary \nshares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the \n-12-\nSeries A Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to \n1/1,000th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (or $25 per \ndepositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary, \nthe depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing \nshares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed.\nIn case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be \nredeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to \nbe equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares \nand any multiple thereof.\nVoting the Series A Preferred Stock\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are \nentitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the \ndepositary shares relating to the Series A Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the \nrecord date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series A Preferred Stock, may instruct the \ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. To \nthe extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by \ndepositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all \nreasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. \nIf the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing \nthe Series A Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with \ninstructions received.\nListing\nThe depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GS PrA.”\nForm of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares\nThe depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series A \nPreferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.\n-13-\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1/1,000TH INTEREST IN A \nSHARE OF FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES C\nDESCRIPTION OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK\nThe depositary is the sole holder of the Company’s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C \n(the “Series C Preferred Stock”), and all references herein to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall \nmean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to \nexercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, as described below under \n“Description of Depositary Shares.”\nThe following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series C Preferred Stock. The following \nsummary of the terms and provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is \nqualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company’s restated certificate of \nincorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context \notherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, \nInc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\nGeneral\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per \nshare. The Series C Preferred Stock is part of a single series of the Company’s authorized preferred stock. The \nCompany may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, \nissue additional shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued \nshares.\nShares of the Series C Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company’s common stock, equally with each other \nseries of the Company’s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each \nother series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued \nwith the requisite consent of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of \ndividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will \ngenerally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of \nlawfully available funds for such payment (i.e., after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity \nclaims). The Series C Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid \ntheir purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of \nSeries C Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of \nstock or other securities of the Company, except under certain limited circumstances described below under “— \nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy.” The Series C Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is \nnot subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series C \nPreferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and \nis not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a \nbank.\nDividends\nDividends on shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock \nare entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors or a duly authorized \ncommittee of the board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-\ncumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10th day of February, May, \nAugust, and November of each year (each, a “dividend payment date”). These dividends accrue, with respect \nto each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per \ndepositary share) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 0.75% above LIBOR (as described below) on \n-14-\nthe related LIBOR determination date (as described below) or (2) 4.00%. In the event that the Company issues \nadditional shares of Series C Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may \naccrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares \nare issued.\nDividends will be payable to holders of record of Series C Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company’s \nbooks on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that dividend payment date or \nsuch other record date fixed by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) \nthat is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a “dividend record \ndate”). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a \nbusiness day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for \nthe Series C Preferred Stock.\nA dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend \npayment date. Dividends payable on the Series C Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year \nand the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise \nbe payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day \nunless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the \nimmediately preceding day that is a business day.\nFor any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business \nday immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner:\n•\nLIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning \non the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of \n11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first \nday of such dividend period.\n•\nIf the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750, LIBOR will be \ndetermined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second \nLondon business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which \ndeposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by \nfour major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent: three-month deposits in \nU.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative \nAmount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks \nto provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second \nLondon business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the \narithmetic mean of the quotations.\n•\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London \nbusiness day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic \nmean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at \napproximately 11:00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day \nimmediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York \nCity selected by the calculation agent: three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first \nday of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount.\n•\nIf fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, \nLIBOR for the new dividend period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior dividend period.\nUnder the FRB’s final rule and the LIBOR Act, on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR \nwas replaced with three-month term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread, with three-month term \nSOFR determined by the calculation agent on the second U.S. government securities business day \nimmediately preceding the first day of the applicable dividend period.\nThe calculation agent’s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for \nany dividend period, will be on file at the Company’s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder \nupon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.\n-15-\nThis subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms \nhave the following meanings:\nThe term “Representative Amount” means an amount that, in the calculation agent’s judgment, is \nrepresentative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.\nThe term “Moneyline Telerate Page” means the display on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, \non the page or pages specified herein or any replacement page or pages on that service.\nThe term “business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a \nday on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive \norder to close.\nThe term “London business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and \nis a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.\nDividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the \nCompany, or a duly authorized committee of the board, does not declare a dividend on the Series C Preferred \nStock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will \nnot accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend \npayment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are declared for \nany future dividend period.\nSo long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared \non the Company’s common stock or any other shares of the Company’s junior stock (as defined below) (other \nthan a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, \nredeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result \nof a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of \njunior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a \nsubstantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the \nlatest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been declared and \npaid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing \nprovision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company’s other affiliates, to \nengage in any market-making transactions in the Company’s junior stock in the ordinary course of business.\nAs used in this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, “junior stock” means any class or series of stock of \nthe Company that ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to \nthe distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes \nthe Company’s common stock.\nWhen dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity \nstock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to \nthe Series C Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the \nSeries C Preferred Stock) in full upon the Series C Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends \ndeclared upon the Series C Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend \npayment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend \npayment dates pertaining to the Series C Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related \ndividend period for the Series C Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of \nsuch dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the \nSeries C Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity \nstock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series C \nPreferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series C Preferred \nStock) bear to each other.\n-16-\nAs used in this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, “parity stock” means any other class or series of \nstock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series C Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in \nthe distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nSubject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the \nCompany’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the \nCompany’s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock \nfrom time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series C Preferred \nStock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series C \nPreferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, \nafter satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common \nstock or of any of the Company’s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of \nSeries C Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per \ndepositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. \nHolders of the Series C Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they \nhave received their full liquidation preference.\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full \nto all holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company’s stock \nranking equally as to such distribution with the Series C Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of \nSeries C Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the \nrespective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the “liquidation \npreference” of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, \nincluding any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any \nholder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in \nfull to all holders of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Company’s stock \nranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company’s other stock shall be entitled to \nreceive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences.\nFor purposes of this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company \nwith any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series C Preferred Stock \nreceive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of \nthe assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or \nwinding up of the Company.\nRedemption\nThe Series C Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar \nprovisions. The Series C Preferred Stock is currently redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, \nupon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share \n(equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any \nundeclared dividends. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or \nrepurchase of the Series C Preferred Stock.\nIf shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first \nclass mail to the holders of record of the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 \ndays nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if the depositary \nshares representing the Series C Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust \nCompany, or “DTC,” the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of \nredemption will include a statement setting forth: (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of the Series \n-17-\nC Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the \nnumber of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places \nwhere holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series C Preferred Stock for payment of the \nredemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock has been given and if the \nfunds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any \nshares of Series C Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, \ndividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, such shares of Series C Preferred \nStock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except \nthe right to receive the redemption price.\nIn case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the \nshares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may \ndetermine to be fair and equitable.\nSee “Description of Depositary Shares” below for information about redemption of the depositary shares \nrelating to the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock.\nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy\nThe Company was previously regulated by the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity (“CSE”) pursuant to \nthe SEC’s rules at that time relating to CSEs (referred to as the “CSE Rules”). The Company treated the Series \nC Preferred Stock as allowable capital in accordance with the CSE Rules (such capital is referred to below as \n“Allowable Capital”).\nIf the regulatory capital requirements that apply to the Company change in the future, the Series C Preferred \nStock may be converted, at the Company’s option and without consent of the holders, into a new series of \npreferred stock, subject to the limitations described below. The Company will be entitled to exercise this \nconversion right as follows.\nIf both of the following occur:\n•\nthe Company (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or \nguidance (together, “regulations”) relating to the Company’s capital adequacy, which \nregulation (i) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital, (ii) \nprovides for a type or level of capital characterized as “Tier 1” or its equivalent pursuant to \nregulations of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company (or any of the \nCompany’s subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing capital standards \npublished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the SEC, the Federal Reserve \nBoard or any other United States national governmental body, or any other applicable regime \nbased on capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its \nsuccessor, or (iii) provides for a type of capital that in the Company’s judgment (after \nconsultation with counsel of recognized standing) is substantially equivalent to such “Tier 1” \ncapital (such capital described in either (ii) or (iii) is referred to below as “Tier 1 Capital \nEquivalent”), and\n•\nthe Company affirmatively elects to qualify the Series C Preferred Stock for such Allowable \nCapital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment without any sublimit or other quantitative \nrestriction on the inclusion of the Series C Preferred Stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 \nCapital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation \nrequiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant \nform of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such regulations,\nthen, upon such affirmative election, the Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the Company’s option \ninto a new series of preferred stock having terms and provisions substantially identical to those of the Series C \nPreferred Stock, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers, and such limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary, in the Company’s \njudgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), to comply with the Required Unrestricted \nCapital Provisions (defined below), provided that the Company will not cause any such conversion unless the \n-18-\nCompany determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of such new series of preferred \nstock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. For example, the Company \ncould agree to restrict its ability to pay dividends on or redeem the new series of preferred stock for a specified \nperiod or indefinitely, to the extent permitted by the terms and provisions of the new series of preferred stock, \nsince such a restriction would be permitted in the Company’s discretion under the terms and provisions of the \nSeries C Preferred Stock.\nThe Company will provide notice to holders of the Series C Preferred Stock of any election to qualify the Series \nC Preferred Stock for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to \nconvert the Series C Preferred Stock into a new series of preferred stock, promptly upon the effectiveness of \nany such election or determination. A copy of any such notice and of the relevant regulations will be on file at \nthe Company’s principal offices and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder.\nAs used above, the term “Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions” means the terms that are, in the \nCompany’s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be \ntreated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other \nquantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent \n(other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a \nspecified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) \npursuant to applicable regulations.\nVoting Rights\nExcept as provided below, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for \nthe equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in \nthis section, a “Nonpayment”), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all \nother series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election \nof a total of two additional members of the Company’s board of directors (as used in this section, the “Preferred \nStock Directors”), provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Company to violate the \ncorporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the \nCompany’s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and \nprovided further that the Company’s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock \nDirectors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company’s board of directors shall automatically \nincrease by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders \nof record of at least 20% of the Series C Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless \nsuch request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the \nstockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of \nstockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the \nshares of the Series C Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four dividend \nperiods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a \nsum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment).\nAs used in this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, “voting preferred stock” means any other class or \nseries of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series C Preferred Stock either as to \ndividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting \nrights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of \nSeries C Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be \ndetermined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted.\nIf and when dividends for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment \nhave been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the \n-19-\nholders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in \nthe event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred \nstock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the \nnumber of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether \ndividends have been paid for four dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Company may take account of \nany dividend the Company elects to pay for such a dividend period after the regular dividend date for that \nperiod has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of \nrecord of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights \ndescribed above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long \nas a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the \ninitial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director \nremaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the \noutstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights \ndescribed above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote \nper director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the \naffirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series C \nPreferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a \nsingle class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting:\n•\namend or alter the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so as to \nauthorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking \nsenior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution \nof assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company;\n•\namend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so \nas to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting \npowers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; or\n•\nconsummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series C Preferred \nStock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) \nthe shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger \nor consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are \nconverted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its \nultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as \nthe case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a \nwhole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;\nprovided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series C Preferred Stock or \nauthorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of \nother series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to \nthe payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of \nassets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the \nrights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock. In addition, any conversion of \nthe Series C Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events, as discussed above under “— \nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy,” will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, \npreferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock.\nIf an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above \nwould adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series C Preferred \nStock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such \nseries of preferred stock.\n-20-\nWithout the consent of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely \naffect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Company may \namend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series C Preferred Stock:\n•\nto cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the \ncertificate of designation for the Series C Preferred Stock that may be defective or \ninconsistent; or\n•\nto make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series C \nPreferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such \nvote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall \nhave been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside \nby the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.\nDESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES\nPlease note that as used in this section, references to “holders” of depositary shares mean those who own \ndepositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for \nthis purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street \nname or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company.\nGeneral\nThe Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each \nrepresenting a 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of Series C Preferred Stock and evidenced by a \ndepositary receipt. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited \nunder a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the \ndepositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each \nholder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share \nof Series C Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the \nSeries C Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\nDividends and Other Distributions\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited \nSeries C Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series C \nPreferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will \ndistribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those \ndistributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or \nthat it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company’s approval, sell \nthe property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion \nto the number of depositary shares they hold.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same \nas the corresponding record dates for the Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be \nwithheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\nIf the Company redeems the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary \nshares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the \n-21-\nSeries C Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to \n1/1,000th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock (or $25 per \ndepositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by the depositary, \nthe depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing \nshares of Series C Preferred Stock so redeemed.\nIn case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be \nredeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to \nbe equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares \nand any multiple thereof.\nVoting the Series C Preferred Stock\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are \nentitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the \ndepositary shares relating to the Series C Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the \nrecord date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series C Preferred Stock, may instruct the \ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. \nTo the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by \ndepositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all \nreasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. \nIf the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing \nthe Series C Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with \ninstructions received.\nListing\nThe depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GS PrC.”\nForm of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares\nThe depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series C \nPreferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.\n-22-\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1/1,000TH INTEREST IN A \nSHARE OF FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES D\nDESCRIPTION OF SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK\nThe depositary is the sole holder of the Company’s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D \n(the “Series D Preferred Stock”), and all references herein to the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall \nmean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to \nexercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, as described below under \n“Description of Depositary Shares.”\nThe following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series D Preferred Stock. The following \nsummary of the terms and provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is \nqualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company’s restated certificate of \nincorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context \notherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, \nInc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\nGeneral\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per \nshare. The Series D Preferred Stock is part of a single series of authorized preferred stock. The Company may \nfrom time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, issue additional \nshares of the Series D Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares.\nShares of the Series D Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company’s common stock, equally with each other \nseries of the Company’s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each \nother series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued \nwith the requisite consent of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of \ndividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will \ngenerally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of \nlawfully available funds for such payment (i.e., after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity \nclaims). The Series D Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid \ntheir purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of \nSeries D Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of \nstock or other securities of the Company, except under certain limited circumstances described below under “— \nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy.” The Series D Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is \nnot subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series D \nPreferred Stock. The Series D Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and \nis not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a \nbank.\nDividends\nDividends on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock \nare entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized \ncommittee of the board), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-\ncumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10th day of February, May, \nAugust, and November of each year (each, a “dividend payment date”). These dividends accrue, with respect \nto each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per \ndepositary share) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 0.67% above LIBOR (as described below) on \nthe related LIBOR determination date (as described below) or (2) 4.00%. In the event that the Company issues \n-23-\nadditional shares of Series D Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may \naccrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares \nare issued.\nDividends will be payable to holders of record of Series D Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company’s \nbooks on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that dividend payment date or \nsuch other record date fixed by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) \nthat is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a “dividend record \ndate”). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a \nbusiness day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for \nthe Series D Preferred Stock.\nA dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend \npayment date. Dividends payable on the Series D Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year \nand the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise \nbe payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day \nunless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the \nimmediately preceding day that is a business day.\nFor any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business \nday immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner:\n•\nLIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning \non the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 (or any \nsuccessor or replacement page) as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London \nbusiness day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period.\n•\nIf the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750 (or any \nsuccessor or replacement page), LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at \napproximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately \npreceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are \noffered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market \nselected by the calculation agent: three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first \nday of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will \nrequest the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If \nat least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately \npreceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.\n•\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London \nbusiness day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic \nmean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at \napproximately 11:00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day \nimmediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York \nCity selected by the calculation agent: three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first \nday of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount.\n•\nIf fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, \nLIBOR for the new dividend period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior dividend period.\nUnder the FRB’s final rule and the LIBOR Act, on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR \nwas replaced with three-month term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread, with three-month term \nSOFR determined by the calculation agent on the second U.S. government securities business day \nimmediately preceding the first day of the applicable dividend period.\nThe calculation agent’s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for \nany dividend period, will be on file at the Company’s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder \nupon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.\n-24-\nThis subscription uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms \nhave the following meanings:\nThe term “Representative Amount” means an amount that, in the calculation agent’s judgment, is \nrepresentative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.\nThe term “Moneyline Telerate Page” means the display on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, \non the page or pages specified herein or any replacement page or pages on that service.\nThe term “business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a \nday on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive \norder to close.\nThe term “London business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and \nis a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.\nDividends on shares of Series D Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the \nCompany (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not declare a dividend on the Series D Preferred \nStock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will \nnot accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend \npayment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are declared for \nany future dividend period.\nSo long as any share of Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared \non the Company’s common stock or any other shares of the Company’s junior stock (as defined below) (other \nthan a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, \nredeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result \nof a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of \njunior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a \nsubstantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the \nlatest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock have been declared and \npaid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing \nprovision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company’s other affiliates, to \nengage in any market-making transactions in the Company’s junior stock in the ordinary course of business.\nAs used in this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, “junior stock” means any class or series of stock of \nthe Company that ranks junior to the Series D Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to \nthe distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes \nthe Company’s common stock.\nWhen dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity \nstock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to \nthe Series D Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the \nSeries D Preferred Stock) in full upon the Series D Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends \ndeclared upon the Series D Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend \npayment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend \npayment dates pertaining to the Series D Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related \ndividend period for the Series D Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of \nsuch dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the \nSeries D Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity \nstock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series D \nPreferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series D Preferred \nStock) bear to each other.\n-25-\nAs used in this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, “parity stock” means any other class or series of \nstock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series D Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in \nthe distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nSubject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the \nCompany’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the \nCompany’s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock \nfrom time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series D Preferred \nStock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series D \nPreferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, \nafter satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common \nstock or of any of the Company’s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of \nSeries D Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per \ndepositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. \nHolders of the Series D Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they \nhave received their full liquidation preference.\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full \nto all holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company’s stock \nranking equally as to such distribution with the Series D Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of \nSeries D Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the \nrespective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the “liquidation \npreference” of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, \nincluding any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any \nholder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in \nfull to all holders of the Company’s Series D Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Company’s stock \nranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company’s other stock shall be entitled to \nreceive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences.\nFor purposes of this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company \nwith any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series D Preferred Stock \nreceive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of \nthe assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or \nwinding up of the Company.\nRedemption\nThe Series D Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar \nprovisions. The Series D Preferred Stock is currently redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, \nupon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share \n(equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any \nundeclared dividends. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or \nrepurchase of the Series D Preferred Stock.\nIf shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first \nclass mail to the holders of record of the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 \ndays nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if the depositary \nshares representing the Series D Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust \nCompany, or “DTC,” the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of \nredemption will include a statement setting forth: (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of the Series \n-26-\nD Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the \nnumber of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places \nwhere holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Stock for payment of the \nredemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock has been given and if the \nfunds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any \nshares of Series D Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, \ndividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series D Preferred Stock, such shares of Series D Preferred \nStock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except \nthe right to receive the redemption price.\nIn case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the \nshares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may \ndetermine to be fair and equitable.\nSee “Description of Depositary Shares” below for information about redemption of the depositary shares \nrelating to the Company’s Series D Preferred Stock.\nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy\nThe Company was previously regulated by the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity (“CSE”) pursuant to \nthe SEC’s rules relating to CSEs (referred to as the “CSE Rules”). The Company treated the Series D Preferred \nStock as allowable capital in accordance with the CSE Rules (such capital is referred to below as “Allowable \nCapital”).\nIf the regulatory capital requirements that apply to the Company change in the future, the Series D Preferred \nStock may be converted, at the Company’s option and without consent of the holders, into a new series of \npreferred stock, subject to the limitations described below. The Company will be entitled to exercise this \nconversion right as follows.\nIf both of the following occur:\n•\nthe Company (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or \nguidance (together, “regulations”) relating to the Company’s capital adequacy, which \nregulation (i) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital, (ii) \nprovides for a type or level of capital characterized as “Tier 1” or its equivalent pursuant to \nregulations of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company (or any of the \nCompany’s subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing capital standards \npublished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the SEC, the Federal Reserve \nBoard or any other United States national governmental body, or any other applicable regime \nbased on capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its \nsuccessor, or (iii) provides for a type of capital that in the Company’s judgment (after \nconsultation with counsel of recognized standing) is substantially equivalent to such “Tier 1” \ncapital (such capital described in either (ii) or (iii) is referred to below as “Tier 1 Capital \nEquivalent”), and\n•\nthe Company affirmatively elects to qualify the Series D Preferred Stock for such Allowable \nCapital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment without any sublimit or other quantitative \nrestriction on the inclusion of the Series D Preferred Stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 \nCapital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation \nrequiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant \nform of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such regulations,\nthen, upon such affirmative election, the Series D Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the Company’s option \ninto a new series of preferred stock having terms and provisions substantially identical to those of the Series D \nPreferred Stock, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers, and such limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary, in the Company’s \njudgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), to comply with the Required Unrestricted \nCapital Provisions (defined below), provided that the Company will not cause any such conversion unless the \n-27-\nCompany determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of such new series of preferred \nstock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. For example, the Company \ncould agree to restrict its ability to pay dividends on or redeem the new series of preferred stock for a specified \nperiod or indefinitely, to the extent permitted by the terms and provisions of the new series of preferred stock, \nsince such a restriction would be permitted in the Company’s discretion under the terms and provisions of the \nSeries D Preferred Stock.\nThe Company will provide notice to holders of the Series D Preferred Stock of any election to qualify the Series \nD Preferred Stock for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to \nconvert the Series D Preferred Stock into a new series of preferred stock, promptly upon the effectiveness of \nany such election or determination. A copy of any such notice and of the relevant regulations will be on file at \nthe Company’s principal offices and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder.\nAs used above, the term “Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions” means the terms that are, in the \nCompany’s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be \ntreated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other \nquantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent \n(other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a \nspecified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) \npursuant to applicable regulations.\nVoting Rights\nExcept as provided below, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock have no voting rights.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for \nthe equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in \nthis section, a “Nonpayment”), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all \nother series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election \nof a total of two additional members of the Company’s board of directors (as used in this section, the “Preferred \nStock Directors”), provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Company to violate the \ncorporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the \nCompany’s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and \nprovided further that the Company’s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock \nDirectors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company’s board of directors shall automatically \nincrease by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders \nof record of at least 20% of the Series D Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless \nsuch request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the \nstockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of \nstockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the \nshares of the Series D Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four dividend \nperiods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a \nsum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment).\nAs used in this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, “voting preferred stock” means any other class or \nseries of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series D Preferred Stock either as to \ndividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting \nrights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of \nSeries D Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be \ndetermined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted.\nIf and when dividends for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment \nhave been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the \n-28-\nholders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in \nthe event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred \nstock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the \nnumber of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether \ndividends have been paid for four dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Company may take account of \nany dividend the Company elects to pay for such a dividend period after the regular dividend date for that \nperiod has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of \nrecord of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights \ndescribed above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long \nas a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the \ninitial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director \nremaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the \noutstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights \ndescribed above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote \nper director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the \naffirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series D \nPreferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a \nsingle class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting:\n•\namend or alter the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so as to \nauthorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking \nsenior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution \nof assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company;\n•\namend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so \nas to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting \npowers of the Series D Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; or\n•\nconsummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series D Preferred \nStock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) \nthe shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger \nor consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are \nconverted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its \nultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as \nthe case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a \nwhole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, \nprivileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;\nprovided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series D Preferred Stock or \nauthorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of \nother series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to \nthe payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of \nassets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the \nrights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock. In addition, any conversion of \nthe Series D Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events, as discussed above under “— \nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy,” will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, \npreferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock.\nIf an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above \nwould adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series D Preferred \nStock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such \nseries of preferred stock.\n-29-\nWithout the consent of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely \naffect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Company may \namend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series D Preferred Stock:\n•\nto cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the \ncertificate of designation for the Series D Preferred Stock that may be defective or \ninconsistent; or\n•\nto make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series D \nPreferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such \nvote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall \nhave been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside \nby the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.\nDESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES\nPlease note that as used in this section, references to “holders” of depositary shares mean those who own \ndepositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for \nthis purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street \nname or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company.\nGeneral\nThe Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each \nrepresenting a 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of Series D Preferred Stock and evidenced by a \ndepositary receipt. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited \nunder a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the \ndepositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each \nholder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share \nof Series D Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the \nSeries D Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\nDividends and Other Distributions\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited \nSeries D Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series D \nPreferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will \ndistribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those \ndistributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or \nthat it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company’s approval, sell \nthe property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion \nto the number of depositary shares they hold.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same \nas the corresponding record dates for the Series D Preferred Stock.\nThe amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be \nwithheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\nIf the Company redeems the Series D Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary \nshares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the \n-30-\nSeries D Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to \n1/1,000th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock (or $25 per \ndepositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by the depositary, \nthe depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing \nshares of Series D Preferred Stock so redeemed.\nIn case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be \nredeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to \nbe equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares \nand any multiple thereof.\nVoting the Series D Preferred Stock\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are \nentitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the \ndepositary shares relating to the Series D Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the \nrecord date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series D Preferred Stock, may instruct the \ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series D Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. \nTo the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series D Preferred Stock represented by \ndepositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all \nreasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. \nIf the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing \nthe Series D Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with \ninstructions received.\nListing\nThe depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GS PrD.”\nForm of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares\nThe depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series D \nPreferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.\n-31-\nDESCRIPTION OF (i) 5.793% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NORMAL AUTOMATIC PREFERRED \nENHANCED CAPITAL SECURITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL II (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY \nGUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.) AND (ii) FLOATING RATE NORMAL \nAUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL SECURITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL III \n(FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)\nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the 5.793% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Automatic \nPreferred Enhanced Capital Securities of Goldman Sachs Capital II and the Floating Rate Normal Automatic \nPreferred Enhanced Capital Securities of Goldman Sachs Capital III (the “APEX”) and of the Trust Agreements \n(both as defined below) under which they are issued. It does not purport to be complete. Unless the context \notherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, \nInc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe APEX and the Common Securities of Goldman Sachs Capital II (“Capital II”) and Goldman Sachs Capital \nIII (“Capital III”), each a Delaware statutory trust (a “Trust”), represent beneficial interests in the relevant Trust. \nThe Trust in respect of Capital II holds the Company’s Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E \n(the “Series E Preferred Stock”), and the Trust in respect of Capital III holds the Company’s Perpetual Non-\nCumulative Preferred Stock, Series F (the “Series F Preferred Stock,” and collectively with the Series E \nPreferred Stock, the “Preferred”).\nEach holder of APEX has a beneficial interest in the relevant Trust but does not own any specific shares of the \nPreferred held by that Trust. However, the applicable trust agreement among the Company, The Bank of New \nYork Mellon, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, the administrative trustees and the several holders of the relevant \nTrust securities (each, a “Trust Agreement”) under which each Trust operates defines the financial entitlements \nof its APEX in a manner that causes those financial entitlements to correspond to the financial entitlements of \nthat Trust in the Preferred it holds. Accordingly, each APEX of Capital II corresponds to 1/100th of a share of \nSeries E Preferred Stock held by Capital II and each APEX of Capital III corresponds to 1/100th of a share of \nSeries F Preferred Stock held by Capital III.\nThe Trusts\nEach Trust is a statutory trust organized under Delaware law pursuant to a Trust Agreement and the filing of a \ncertificate of trust with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nThe Trusts are used solely for the following purposes:\n•\nissuing the APEX and the Common Securities;\n•\nholding shares of the Preferred; and\n•\nengaging in other activities that are directly related to the activities described above.\nThe Company owns all of the Common Securities, either directly or indirectly. The Common Securities rank \nequally with the APEX and the Trusts make payment on their Trust securities pro rata, except that if the \nCompany pays less than the full dividend on or redemption price of the Preferred, the rights of the holders of \nthe Common Securities to payment in respect of distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and \notherwise are subordinated to the rights of the holders of the APEX.\nEach Trust is perpetual, but may be dissolved earlier as provided in its Trust Agreement.\nThe Company pays all fees and expenses related to the Trusts.\n-32-\nDESCRIPTION OF THE APEX\nGeneral\nThe APEX are securities of each Trust and are issued pursuant to the applicable Trust Agreement. The \nProperty Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, acts as indenture trustee for the APEX under the Trust \nAgreement for purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Each APEX has a \nliquidation amount of $1,000.\nThe terms of the APEX of each Trust include those stated in the Trust Agreement for such Trust, including any \namendments thereto and those made part of the Trust Agreement by the Trust Indenture Act and the Delaware \nStatutory Trust Act.\nIn addition to the APEX, each Trust Agreement authorizes the administrative trustees of the Trust to issue the \nCommon Securities on behalf of the Trust. The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the Common \nSecurities. The Common Securities rank on a parity, and payments upon redemption, liquidation or otherwise \nare made on a proportionate basis, with the APEX except as set forth below under “— Ranking of Common \nSecurities.” The Trust Agreements do not permit the Trust to issue any securities other than the Common \nSecurities and the APEX or to incur any indebtedness.\nUnder the Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee on behalf of the relevant Trust holds the Preferred for the \nbenefit of the holders of its APEX and Common Securities.\nThe payment of distributions out of money held by a Trust, and payments upon redemption of the APEX or \nliquidation of the Trust, are guaranteed by the Company to the extent described under “Description of the \nGuarantees.” Each Guarantee, when taken together with the Company’s obligations under the applicable Trust \nAgreement, including its obligations to pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities of the Trust, other than with \nrespect to its Common Securities and APEX, has the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee of \namounts due on the APEX. The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Guarantee Trustee, holds each Guarantee for \nthe benefit of the holders of the APEX. The Guarantees do not cover payment of distributions when the Trusts \ndo not have sufficient available funds to pay those distributions.\nWhen the term “holder” is used in this description of the APEX with respect to a registered APEX, it means the \nperson in whose name such APEX is registered in the security register. The APEX are currently held in book-\nentry form only, and are held in the name of DTC or its nominee.\nCapital II’s APEX are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GS/PE” and Capital III’s APEX \nare listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GS/PF.”\nThe financial entitlements as a holder of APEX generally correspond to the applicable Trust’s financial \nentitlements as a holder of the Preferred. The corresponding asset for each APEX is a 1/100th, or $1,000, \ninterest in one share of Preferred held by the Trust. Each Trust will pass through to the holder amounts that it \nreceives on the corresponding assets for the APEX as distributions on, or the liquidation preference of, APEX. \nHolders of a Trust’s APEX are be entitled to receive distributions corresponding to non-cumulative dividends on \nthe Preferred held by the Trust. These cash dividends are payable if, as and when declared by the Company’s \nboard of directors, on the Dividend Payment Dates (as defined below), which are: quarterly in arrears on each \nMarch 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 (or if such day is not a business day, the next business day).\nAssuming that the Company does not elect to pay partial dividends or to skip dividends on the Preferred, \nholders of APEX will receive distributions on the $1,000 liquidation amount per APEX at a rate per annum equal \nto the greater of (x) three-month LIBOR for the related distribution period plus 0.765% (in the case of Capital \nII’s APEX) or 0.77% (in the case of Capital III’s APEX) and (y) 4.000%, payable quarterly on each March 1, \nJune 1, September 1 and December 1 (or if any such date is not a business day, on the next business day).\n-33-\nDividends are calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the number of days actually elapsed in the \ndividend period. Distributions on the APEX and dividends on the Preferred are non-cumulative.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon acts as registrar and transfer agent, or “Transfer Agent,” for the APEX. If The \nBank of New York Mellon should resign or be removed, the Company or the Trust will designate a successor \nand the term “Transfer Agent” as used herein will refer to that successor. A “business day” as used in this \nsection means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions and trust \ncompanies in New York, New York or Wilmington, Delaware are permitted or required by any applicable law to \nclose.\nEach Trust must make distributions on its APEX on each distribution date to the extent that it has funds \navailable therefor. A Trust’s funds available for distribution to a holder of its APEX will be limited to payments \nreceived from the Company on the Preferred held by the Trust. The Company guarantees the payment of \ndistributions on the APEX out of moneys held by each Trust to the extent of available Trust funds, as described \nunder “Description of the Guarantees” below.\nDistributions on the APEX are payable to holders as they appear in the security register of the Trust on the \nrelevant record dates. The record dates are the fifteenth calendar day immediately preceding the next \nsucceeding distribution date. Distributions are paid through the Property Trustee or paying agent, who hold \namounts received in respect of the Preferred for the benefit of the holders of the APEX.\nFor more information about dividends on the Preferred, see “— Dividends” below.\nAgreed Tax Treatment of the APEX\nAs a beneficial owner of APEX, by acceptance of the beneficial interest therein, the holder will be deemed to \nhave agreed, for all U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n•\nto treat the holder as the owner of a 1/100th interest in a share of the relevant Preferred; and\n•\nto treat the Trust as one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements.\nMandatory Redemption of APEX upon Redemption of the Preferred\nThe APEX have no stated maturity but must be redeemed on the date the Company redeems the Preferred, \nand the Property Trustee or paying agent will apply the proceeds from such repayment or redemption to \nredeem a like amount, as defined below, of the APEX. The Preferred is perpetual but the Company may \nredeem it on any Dividend Payment Date, subject to certain limitations. See “— Redemption” below. The \nredemption price per APEX will equal the redemption price of the Preferred. See “— Redemption” below. If \nnotice of redemption of any Preferred has been given and if the funds necessary for the redemption have been \nset aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of the Preferred so called for redemption, \nthen, from and after the redemption date, those shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of \nthe holders of those shares (including the right to receive any dividends) will terminate, except the right to \nreceive the redemption price.\nIf less than all of the shares of the Preferred held by the Trust are to be redeemed on a redemption date, then \nthe proceeds from such redemption will be allocated pro rata to the redemption of the APEX and the Common \nSecurities, except as set forth below under “— Ranking of Common Securities.”\nThe term “like amount” as used above means APEX having a liquidation amount equal to that portion of the \nliquidation amount of the Preferred to be contemporaneously redeemed, the proceeds of which will be used to \npay the redemption price of such APEX.\nDistributions to be paid on or before the redemption date for any APEX called for redemption will be payable to \nthe holders as of the record dates for the related dates of distribution. If the APEX called for redemption are no \n-34-\nlonger in book-entry form, the Property Trustee, to the extent funds are available, will irrevocably deposit with \nthe paying agent for the APEX funds sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price and will give such paying \nagent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender \nof their certificates evidencing the APEX.\nIf notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such \ndeposit:\n•\nall rights of the holders of such APEX called for redemption will cease, except the right of the \nholders of such APEX to receive the redemption price and any distribution payable in respect \nof the APEX on or prior to the redemption date, but without interest on such redemption price; \nand\n•\nthe APEX called for redemption will cease to be outstanding. If any redemption date is not a \nbusiness day, then the redemption amount will be payable on the next business day (and \nwithout any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). However, if payment on \nthe next business day causes payment of the redemption amount to be in the next calendar \nmonth, then payment will be on the preceding business day.\nIf payment of the redemption amount for the Preferred held by a Trust called for redemption is improperly \nwithheld or refused and accordingly the redemption amount of the Trust’s APEX is not paid either by the Trust \nor by the Company under the applicable Guarantee, then dividends on the Preferred called for redemption will \ncontinue to accrue and distributions on such series of APEX called for redemption will continue to accumulate \nat the applicable rate then borne by such APEX from the original redemption date scheduled to the actual date \nof payment. In this case, the actual payment date will be considered the redemption date for purposes of \ncalculating the redemption amount.\nRedemptions of the APEX will require prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.\nThe Company will not exercise its option to redeem any shares of the Preferred without obtaining the approval \nof the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as required by applicable \nlaw. Unless the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) authorizes the \nCompany to do otherwise in writing, the Company will redeem the Preferred only if it is replaced with other tier \n1 capital that is not a restricted core capital element (e.g., common stock or another series of noncumulative \nperpetual preferred stock).\nIf less than all of the outstanding shares of the Preferred held by a Trust are to be redeemed on a redemption \ndate, then the aggregate liquidation amount of APEX and Common Securities of that Trust to be redeemed \nshall be allocated pro rata to the APEX and Common Securities based upon the relative liquidation amounts of \nsuch series, except as set forth below under “— Ranking of Common Securities.” The Property Trustee will \nselect the particular APEX to be redeemed on a pro rata basis not more than 60 days before the redemption \ndate from the outstanding APEX not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee \ndeems fair and appropriate, or if the APEX are in book-entry only form, in accordance with the procedures of \nDTC. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Transfer Agent in writing of the APEX selected for \nredemption and, in the case of any APEX selected for redemption in part, the liquidation amount to be \nredeemed.\nFor all purposes of the Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the \nredemption of APEX shall relate, in the case of any APEX redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the \nportion of the aggregate liquidation amount of APEX that has been or is to be redeemed. If less than all of the \nAPEX, the APEX held through the facilities of DTC will be redeemed pro rata in accordance with DTC’s internal \nprocedures.\nLiquidation Distribution upon Dissolution\nPursuant to each Trust Agreement, the applicable Trust shall dissolve on the first to occur of:\n-35-\n•\ncertain events of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the Company;\n•\nredemption of all of its APEX as described above; and\n•\nthe entry of an order for the dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nExcept as set forth in the next paragraph, if an early dissolution occurs as a result of certain events of \nbankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Property Trustee and the administrative trustees will \nliquidate the Trust as expeditiously as they determine possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to \ncreditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each holder of its APEX a like amount of the Preferred \nheld by the Trust as of the date of such distribution. Except as set forth in the next paragraph, if an early \ndissolution occurs as a result of the entry of an order for the dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent \njurisdiction, the Property Trustee will liquidate the Trust as expeditiously as it determines to be possible by \ndistributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each holder \nof its APEX a like amount of the Preferred held by the Trust as of the date of such distribution. The Property \nTrustee shall give notice of liquidation to each holder of APEX at least 30 days and not more than 60 days \nbefore the date of liquidation.\nIf, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, the \nProperty Trustee determines that distribution of the Preferred in the manner provided above is not possible, or if \nthe early dissolution occurs as a result of the redemption of all the APEX, the Property Trustee shall liquidate \nthe property of the Trust and wind up its affairs. In that case, upon the winding up of the Trust, except with \nrespect to an early dissolution that occurs as a result of the redemption of all the APEX, the holders will be \nentitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to holders and after satisfaction of \nliabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the aggregate liquidation \namount per Trust security plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of payment. If, upon any such \nwinding up, the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full such aggregate liquidation distribution, then \nthe amounts payable directly by the Trust on its Trust securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis, except as set \nforth below under “— Ranking of Common Securities.”\nThe term “like amount” as used above means Preferred having a liquidation preference equal to the liquidation \namount of the APEX of the holder to whom such Preferred would be distributed.\nDistribution of Trust Assets\nUpon liquidation of a Trust other than as a result of an early dissolution upon the redemption of all the APEX \nand after satisfaction of the liabilities of creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, the assets of the \nTrust will be distributed to the holders of such Trust securities in exchange therefor.\nAfter the liquidation date fixed for any distribution of assets of the Trust:\n•\nthe APEX will no longer be deemed to be outstanding;\n•\nDTC or its nominee, as the record holder of the APEX, will receive a registered global \ncertificate or certificates representing the Preferred to be delivered upon such distribution;\n•\nany certificates representing the APEX not held by DTC or its nominee will be deemed to \nrepresent shares of the Preferred having a Liquidation Preference equal to the APEX until \nsuch certificates are so surrendered for transfer and reissuance; and\n•\nall rights of the holders of the APEX will cease, except the right to receive Preferred upon such \nsurrender.\nSince each APEX corresponds to 1/100th of a share of Preferred, holders of APEX may receive fractional \nshares of the Preferred or depositary shares representing the Preferred upon this distribution.\n-36-\nRanking of Common Securities\nIf on any distribution date a Trust does not have funds available from dividends on the Preferred it holds to \nmake full distributions on its APEX and Common Securities, then the available funds from dividends on the \nPreferred it holds shall be applied first to make distributions then due on its APEX on a pro rata basis on such \ndistribution date up to the amount of such distributions corresponding to dividends on the Preferred (or if less, \nthe amount of the corresponding distributions that would have been made on the APEX had the Company paid \na full dividend on the Preferred) before any such amount is applied to make a distribution on the Trust’s \nCommon Securities on such distribution date.\nIf on any date where APEX and Common Securities must be redeemed because the Company is redeeming \nPreferred and a Trust does not have funds available from the Company’s redemption of the Preferred it holds to \npay the full redemption price then due on all of its outstanding APEX and Common Securities to be redeemed, \nthen (i) the available funds shall be applied first to pay the redemption price on the APEX to be redeemed on \nsuch redemption date and (ii) Common Securities shall be redeemed only to the extent funds are available for \nsuch purpose after the payment of the full redemption price on the APEX to be redeemed.\nIf an early dissolution event occurs in respect of a Trust, no liquidation distributions shall be made on its \nCommon Securities until full liquidation distributions have been made on its APEX.\nIn the case of any event of default under the Trust Agreement of a Trust resulting from the Company’s failure to \ncomply in any material respect with any of its obligations as issuer of the Preferred held by the Trust, including \nobligations set forth in its restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or “restated certificate of \nincorporation,” or arising under applicable law, the Company, as holder of its Common Securities, will be \ndeemed to have waived any right to act with respect to any such event of default under the Trust Agreement \nuntil the effect of all such events of default with respect to its APEX have been cured, waived or otherwise \neliminated. Until all events of default under the Trust Agreement have been so cured, waived or otherwise \neliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the holders of its APEX and not on the Company’s \nbehalf, and only the holders of its APEX will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf.\nEvents of Default; Notice\nAny one of the following events constitutes an event of default under a Trust Agreement, or a “Trust Event of \nDefault,” regardless of the reason for such event of default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be \neffected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or \nregulation of any administrative or governmental body:\n•\nthe failure to comply in any material respect with the Company’s obligations as issuer of the \nPreferred, under its restated certificate of incorporation, or those of the Trust, or arising under \napplicable law;\n•\nthe default by the Trust in the payment of any distribution on any Trust security of the Trust \nwhen such becomes due and payable, and continuation of such default for a period of 30 \ndays;\n•\nthe default by the Trust in the payment of any redemption price of any Trust security of the \nTrust when such becomes due and payable;\n•\nthe failure to perform or the breach, in any material respect, of any other covenant or warranty \nof the trustees in the Trust Agreement for 90 days after the defaulting trustee or trustees have \nreceived written notice of the failure to perform or breach in the manner specified in such Trust \nAgreement; or\n•\nthe occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Property \nTrustee and the Company’s failure to appoint a successor Property Trustee within 90 days.\n-37-\nWithin 30 days after any Trust Event of Default with respect to a Trust actually known to the Property Trustee \noccurs, the Property Trustee will transmit notice of such Trust Event of Default to the holders of its APEX and to \nthe administrative trustees, unless such Trust Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. The Company, \nas sponsor, and the administrative trustees are required to file annually with the Property Trustee a certificate \nas to whether or not the Company or the administrative trustees are in compliance with all the conditions and \ncovenants applicable to the Company and to the administrative trustees under the Trust Agreement.\nMergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of a Trust\nA Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its \nproperties and assets substantially as an entirety to the Company or any other person, except as described \nbelow or as otherwise described in its Trust Agreement. A Trust may, at the Company’s request, with the \nconsent of the administrative trustees but without the consent of the holders of its APEX, the Property Trustee \nor the Delaware Trustee, merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or \nlease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, a trust organized as such under the laws of any \nstate if:\n•\nsuch successor entity either:\n•\nexpressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to its APEX, or\n•\nsubstitutes for its APEX other securities having substantially the same terms as its \nAPEX, or the “Successor Securities,” so long as the Successor Securities rank the \nsame as its APEX in priority with respect to distributions and payments upon \nliquidation, redemption and otherwise;\n•\na trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property \nTrustee is appointed to hold the Preferred then held by or on behalf of the Property Trustee;\n•\nsuch merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does \nnot cause its APEX, including any Successor Securities, to be downgraded by any nationally \nrecognized statistical rating organization;\n•\nsuch merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does \nnot adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of its APEX, including \nany Successor Securities, in any material respect;\n•\nsuch successor entity has purposes substantially identical to those of the Trust;\n•\nprior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or \nlease, the Property Trustee has received an opinion from counsel to the Trust experienced in \nsuch matters to the effect that:\n•\nsuch merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or \nlease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of \nits APEX, including any Successor Securities, in any material respect, and\n•\nfollowing such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, \ntransfer or lease, neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to \nregister as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or \n“Investment Company Act”;\n•\nthe Trust has received an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters that such merger, \nconsolidation, amalgamation, conveyance, transfer or lease will not cause the Trust or the \nsuccessor entity to be classified as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as \na corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and\n-38-\n•\nthe Company or any permitted successor or assignee owns all of the common securities of \nsuch successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the \nSuccessor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a Trust may not, except with the consent of holders of 100% in liquidation \namount of its APEX, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or \nlease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to \nconsolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, \nreplacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as \nother than one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements or to be classified as an association or a publicly \ntraded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nVoting Rights; Amendment of a Trust Agreement\nExcept as provided herein and under “— Amendments and Assignment” below and as otherwise required by \nlaw and the Trust Agreement, the holders of a Trust’s APEX have no voting rights or control over the \nadministration, operation or management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties to its Trust Agreement, \nincluding in respect of the Preferred held by the Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, however, the Property \nTrustee is required to obtain their consent before exercising some of its rights in respect of these securities.\nTrust Agreement. The Company and the administrative trustees may amend a Trust’s Trust Agreement \nwithout the consent of the holders of its APEX, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, unless in the \ncase of the first two bullets below such amendment will materially and adversely affect the interests of any \nholder of APEX or the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee or impose any additional duty or obligation on \nthe Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, to:\n•\ncure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provisions in the Trust Agreement that may be \ninconsistent with any other provision, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters \nor questions arising under the Trust Agreement, which may not be inconsistent with the other \nprovisions of the Trust Agreement;\n•\nmodify, eliminate or add to any provisions of the Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be \nnecessary to ensure that the Trust will be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as \none or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements and not as an association or a publicly \ntraded partnership taxable as a corporation at all times that any Trust securities are \noutstanding, or to ensure that the Trust will not be required to register as an “investment \ncompany” under the Investment Company Act;\n•\nprovide that certificates for the APEX may be executed by an administrative trustee by \nfacsimile signature instead of manual signature, in which case such amendment(s) shall also \nprovide for the appointment by the Company of an authentication agent and certain related \nprovisions;\n•\nrequire that holders that are not U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes irrevocably \nappoint a U.S. person to exercise any voting rights to ensure that the Trust will not be treated \nas a foreign trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or\n•\nconform the terms of the Trust Agreement to the description of the Trust Agreement, the APEX \nand the Common Securities in the prospectus dated December 5, 2006, of the Company and \nthe Trusts, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated May 8, 2007, in the manner \nprovided in the Trust Agreement.\nAny such amendment shall become effective when notice thereof is given to the Property Trustee, the \nDelaware Trustee and the holders of the APEX.\nThe Company and the administrative trustees may generally amend a Trust’s Trust Agreement with:\n-39-\n•\nthe consent of holders representing not less than a majority, based upon liquidation amounts, \nof its APEX; and\n•\nreceipt by the administrative trustees of the Trust of an opinion of counsel to the effect that \nsuch amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the administrative trustees of the \nTrust or the administrative trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the \nTrust’s status as one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements for U.S. federal income \ntax purposes or affect the Trust’s exemption from status as an “investment company” under \nthe Investment Company Act.\nHowever, without the consent of each affected holder of Trust securities, a Trust Agreement may not be \namended to:\n•\nchange the amount or timing, or otherwise adversely affect the amount, of any distribution \nrequired to be made in respect of Trust securities as of a specified date; or\n•\nrestrict the right of a holder of Trust securities to institute a suit for the enforcement of any \nsuch payment on or after such date.\nPreferred Stock. So long as Preferred is held by the Property Trustee on behalf of a Trust, the trustees of the \nTrust will not waive any rights in respect of the Preferred without obtaining the prior approval of the holders of at \nleast a majority in liquidation amount of its APEX then outstanding. The trustees of the Trust shall also not \nconsent to any amendment to the Trust’s or the Company’s governing documents that would change the dates \non which dividends are payable or the amount of such dividends, without the prior written consent of each \nholder of APEX. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals from holders, the administrative trustees shall \nobtain, at the Company’s expense, an opinion of counsel to the effect that such action shall not cause the Trust \nto be taxable as a corporation or classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nGeneral. Any required approval of holders of APEX may be given at a meeting of holders convened for such \npurpose or pursuant to written consent. The Property Trustee will cause a notice of any meeting at which \nholders are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such holders is to be \ntaken, to be given to each record holder in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement.\nNo vote or consent of the holders of APEX will be required for a Trust to redeem and cancel the APEX in \naccordance with a Trust Agreement.\nNotwithstanding that holders of the APEX are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances \ndescribed above, any of the APEX that are owned by the Company or its affiliates or the trustees shall be \ndeemed not to be outstanding.\nPayment and Paying Agent\nPayments on the APEX shall be made to DTC, which shall credit the relevant accounts on the applicable \ndistribution dates. If any APEX are not held by DTC, such payments shall be made by check mailed to the \naddress of the holder as such address shall appear on the register.\nThe paying agent is The Bank of New York Mellon and any co-paying agent chosen by the Property Trustee \nand acceptable to the Company and to the administrative trustees.\nRegistrar and Transfer Agent\nThe Bank of New York Mellon acts as registrar and transfer agent, or “Transfer Agent,” for the APEX.\n-40-\nInformation Concerning the Property Trustee\nOther than during the occurrence and continuance of a Trust Event of Default, the Property Trustee undertakes \nto perform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement. After a Trust Event of Default, \nthe Property Trustee must exercise the same degree of care and skill as a prudent individual would exercise or \nuse in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to this provision, the Property Trustee is under no obligation \nto exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Trust Agreement at the request of any holder of APEX unless it \nis offered indemnity satisfactory to it by such holder against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be \nincurred. If no Trust Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Property Trustee is required to \ndecide between alternative courses of action, construe ambiguous provisions in the Trust Agreement or is \nunsure of the application of any provision of the Trust Agreement, and the matter is not one upon which holders \nof APEX are entitled under the Trust Agreement to vote, then the Property Trustee will take any action that the \nCompany directs. If the Company does not provide direction, the Property Trustee may take any action that it \ndeems advisable and in the interests of the holders of the Trust securities and will have no liability except for its \nown bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct.\nThe Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the Property \nTrustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.\nTrust Expenses\nPursuant to each Trust Agreement, the Company, as sponsor, agrees to pay:\n•\nall debts and other obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to its APEX);\n•\nall costs and expenses of the Trust, including costs and expenses relating to the organization \nof the Trust, the fees, expenses and indemnities of the trustees and the cost and expenses \nrelating to the operation of the Trust; and\n•\nany and all taxes and costs and expenses with respect thereto, other than U.S. withholding \ntaxes, to which the Trust might become subject.\nGoverning Law\nEach Trust Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.\nMiscellaneous\nThe administrative trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of and to operate each Trust in \nsuch a way that it will not be required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company \nAct or characterized as other than one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements for U.S. federal income \ntax purposes.\nIn this regard, the Company and the administrative trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent \nwith applicable law, the certificate of trust of a Trust or its Trust Agreement, that the Company and the \nadministrative trustees determine to be necessary or desirable to achieve such end, as long as such action \ndoes not materially and adversely affect the interests of the holders of the APEX.\nHolders of the APEX have no preemptive or similar rights. The APEX are not convertible into or exchangeable \nfor the Company’s common stock or preferred stock.\nSubject to any applicable rules of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking \nagency), the Company or its affiliates may from time to time purchase any of the APEX that are then \noutstanding by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.\n-41-\nThe Trust may not borrow money or issue debt or mortgage or pledge any of its assets.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE GUARANTEES\nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the Guarantee (as defined below) pursuant to the Guarantee \nAgreement for Goldman Sachs Capital II (formerly known as Goldman Sachs Capital IV), dated as of March 23, \n2016, and the Guarantee Agreement for Goldman Sachs Capital III (formerly known as Goldman Sachs Capital \nV), dated as of March 23, 2016 (collectively, the “Guarantee Agreements”). The description does not purport to \nbe complete.\nGeneral\nThe following payments on each Trust’s APEX, also referred to as the “guarantee payments,” if not fully paid by \nthe Trust, will be paid by the Company under a guarantee, or “Guarantee,” that the Company has executed and \ndelivered for the benefit of the holders of such APEX. Pursuant to each Guarantee, the Company irrevocably \nand unconditionally agrees to pay in full the guarantee payments, without duplication:\n•\nany accumulated and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the APEX, to the extent the \nTrust has funds available to make the payment;\n•\nthe redemption price for any APEX called for redemption, to the extent the Trust has funds \navailable to make the payment; and\n•\nupon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the Trust, other than in \nconnection with a distribution of a like amount of corresponding assets to the holders of the \nAPEX, the lesser of:\n•\nthe aggregate of the liquidation amount and all accumulated and unpaid distributions \non the APEX to the date of payment, to the extent the Trust has funds available to \nmake the payment; and\n•\nthe amount of assets of the Trust remaining available for distribution to holders of the \nAPEX upon liquidation of the Trust.\nThe Company’s obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required \namounts by the Company to the holders of the APEX or by causing the Trust to pay the amounts to the holders.\nIf the Company does not make a regular dividend payment on the Preferred held by a Trust, the Trust will not \nhave sufficient funds to make the related payments on the relevant series of APEX. The Guarantee does not \ncover payments on the APEX when the Trust does not have sufficient funds to make these payments. Because \nthe Company is a holding company, its rights to participate in the assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the \nsubsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors except to \nthe extent that the Company may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. The \nGuarantee does not limit the incurrence or issuance by the Company of other secured or unsecured \nindebtedness.\nEach Guarantee is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The Bank of New York Mellon acts \nas “Guarantee Trustee” for each Guarantee for purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Trust \nIndenture Act. The Guarantee Trustee holds each Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of APEX.\nEffect of the Guarantees\nEach Guarantee, when taken together with the Company’s obligations and the Trust’s obligations under the \nTrust Agreement, including the obligations to pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities of the applicable Trust, \nother than with respect to its Trust securities, has the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee, on a \nsubordinated basis, of payments due on its APEX.\n-42-\nThe Company has also agreed separately to irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the obligations of each \nTrust with respect to its Common Securities to the same extent as the Guarantee.\nStatus of the Guarantees\nEach Guarantee is unsecured and ranks:\n•\nsubordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company’s senior and subordinated \ndebt; and\n•\nequally with any of the Company’s other present or future obligations that by their terms rank \npari passu with such Guarantee.\nEach Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection, which means that the guaranteed \nparty may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without suing any other person or entity. \nEach Guarantee is held for the benefit of the holders of APEX. Each Guarantee will be discharged only by \npayment of the guarantee payments in full to the extent not paid by the applicable Trust.\nAmendments and Assignment\nA Guarantee may be amended only with the prior approval of the holders of not less than a majority in \naggregate liquidation amount of the applicable outstanding APEX. No vote is required, however, for any \nchanges that do not adversely affect the rights of holders of APEX in any material respect. All guarantees and \nagreements contained in the Guarantee bind the Company’s successors, assignees, receivers, trustees and \nrepresentatives and are for the benefit of the holders of the applicable APEX then outstanding.\nTermination of the Guarantees\nA Guarantee will terminate:\n•\nupon full payment of the redemption price of all applicable APEX; or\n•\nupon full payment of the amounts payable in accordance with the Trust Agreement upon \nliquidation of the Trust.\nA Guarantee will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any holder of \nAPEX must restore payment of any sums paid under the APEX or the Guarantee.\nEvents of Default\nAn event of default under a Guarantee will occur if the Company fails to perform any payment obligation or if \nthe Company fails to perform any other obligation under the Guarantee and such default remains unremedied \nfor 30 days.\nThe holders of a majority in liquidation amount of the applicable APEX have the right to direct the time, method \nand place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee in respect of a \nGuarantee or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under the \nGuarantee. Any holder of APEX may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Company to enforce the \nGuarantee Trustee’s rights and the Company’s obligations under a Guarantee, without first instituting a legal \nproceeding against the Trust, the Guarantee Trustee or any other person or entity.\nAs guarantor, the Company is required to file annually with the Guarantee Trustee a certificate as to whether or \nnot the Company is in compliance with all applicable conditions and covenants under the Guarantee.\n-43-\nInformation Concerning the Guarantee Trustee\nPrior to the occurrence of an event of default relating to a Guarantee, the Guarantee Trustee is required to \nperform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the Guarantees. Following the occurrence of an event of \ndefault, the Guarantee Trustee will exercise the same degree of care as a prudent individual would exercise in \nthe conduct of his or her own affairs. Provided that the foregoing requirements have been met, the Guarantee \nTrustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Guarantees at the request of \nany holder of APEX, unless offered indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which \nmight be incurred thereby.\nThe Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the \nGuarantee Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.\nGoverning Law\nThe Guarantees are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.\nLimited Purpose of Trust\nThe Trust securities evidence beneficial interests in the Trust. A principal difference between the rights of a \nholder of a Trust security and a holder of Preferred is that a holder of Preferred would be entitled to receive \nfrom the issuer the dividends, redemption payments and payment upon liquidation in respect of Preferred while \na holder of Trust securities is entitled to receive distributions from a Trust, or from the Company under a \nGuarantee, if and to the extent the Trust has funds available for the payment of such distributions.\nRights upon Dissolution\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust, holders of each series of APEX will receive the \ndistributions described under “— Liquidation Distribution upon Dissolution” above. Upon any voluntary or \ninvoluntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Company, the holders of the Preferred would be preferred \nshareholders of the Company, entitled to the preferences upon liquidation described under “Description of the \nPreferred” below. Since the Company is the guarantor under the Guarantee and has agreed to pay for all costs, \nexpenses and liabilities of the Trust, other than the Trust’s obligations to the holders of the Trust securities, the \npositions of a holder of APEX relative to other creditors and to the Company’s shareholders in the event of \nliquidation or bankruptcy are expected to be substantially the same as if that holder held the corresponding \nassets of the Trust directly.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the Preferred held by the relevant Trust. This summary does \nnot purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s restated \ncertificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part.\nGeneral\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per \nshare (including the Preferred).\nShares of the Preferred rank senior to the Company’s common stock, equally with each other series of the \nCompany’s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and at least equally with each other series of \npreferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite \nconsent of the holders of the Preferred), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets \nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Preferred is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its \nholders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional \n-44-\nfunds. Holders of the Preferred do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more preferred stock of \nthe Company. The Preferred is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of \nstock or other securities of the Company. The Preferred has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking \nfund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Preferred.\nThe Preferred has a fixed liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. If the Company liquidates, dissolves or \nwinds up its affairs, holders of the Preferred will be entitled to receive, out of the Company’s assets that are \navailable for distribution to shareholders, an amount per share equal to the liquidation preference per share, \nplus any declared and unpaid dividends, without regard to any undeclared dividends.\nUnless the Trust is dissolved prior to the redemption of the Preferred, holders of APEX will not receive shares of \nthe Preferred, and their interest in the Preferred will be represented by their APEX. If the Trust is dissolved, the \nCompany may elect to distribute depositary shares representing the Preferred instead of fractional shares. \nSince the Preferred is held by the Property Trustee, holders of APEX are only able to exercise voting or other \nrights with respect to the Preferred through the Property Trustee.\nDividends\nDividends on shares of the Preferred are not mandatory. Holders of the Preferred are entitled to receive, when, \nas and if declared by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board), out of \nfunds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from \nthe date of their issuance. These dividends are payable on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of \neach year (each, for purposes of this section, a “Dividend Payment Date”), with respect to the Dividend Period, \nor portion thereof, ending on the day preceding the respective Dividend Payment Date, at a rate per annum \nequal to the greater of (x) three-month LIBOR for the related distribution period plus 0.765% (in the case of the \nSeries E Preferred Stock) or 0.77% (in the case of the Series F Preferred Stock) and (y) 4.000%.\nDividends are payable to holders of record of the Preferred as they appear on the Company’s books on the \napplicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that Dividend Payment Date or such other \nrecord date fixed by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not \nmore than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, for purposes of this section, a \n“Dividend Record Date”). These Dividend Record Dates apply regardless of whether a particular Dividend \nRecord Date is a business day.\nA “Dividend Period” is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next \nDividend Payment Date. If any that would otherwise be a Dividend Payment Date is not a business day, then \nthe next business day will be the applicable Dividend Payment Date.\nThe amount of dividends payable per share of the Preferred on each Dividend Payment Date is calculated by \nmultiplying the per annum Dividend Rate in effect for that Dividend Period by a fraction, the numerator of which \nis the actual number of days in that Dividend Period and the denominator of which is 360, and multiplying the \nrate obtained by $100,000.\nFor any Dividend Period, LIBOR shall be determined by Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as calculation agent for \nthe Preferred, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period, \nas the case may be, in the following manner:\n•\nLIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning \non the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or any \nsuccessor or replacement page) as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London \nbusiness day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, \nas the case may be.\n•\nIf the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or \nreplacement page), LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately \n-45-\n11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first \nday of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, at which deposits of the \nfollowing kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks \nin that market selected by the calculation agent: three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, \nbeginning on the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, and \nin a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of \neach of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, \nLIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such \nDividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, will be the arithmetic mean of the \nquotations.\n•\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London \nbusiness day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, \nas the case may be, will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to \nleading European banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City time on the \nsecond London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or \nInterest Period, as the case may be, by three major banks in New York City selected by the \ncalculation agent: three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such \nDividend Period, and in a Representative Amount.\n•\nIf fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, \nLIBOR for the new Dividend Period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior Dividend Period or \nInterest Period, as the case may be.\nThe calculation agent’s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for \nany Dividend Period, will be on file at the Company’s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder \nupon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.\nThis subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms \nhave the following meanings:\nThe term “Representative Amount” means an amount that, in the calculation agent’s judgment, is \nrepresentative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.\n“Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page” means the display designated on the Reuters 3000 Xtra (or such other page \nas may replace that page on that service or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers’ \nAssociation for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. Dollar deposits).\nThe term “business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a \nday on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive \norder to close.\nThe term “London business day” means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and \nis a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. If the Company \ndetermines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend, the Company will provide prior written notice to the \nProperty Trustee, who will notify holders of APEX, and the administrative trustees.\nDividends on the Preferred are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company (or a duly \nauthorized committee of the board) does not declare a dividend on the Preferred payable in respect of any \nDividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Company will \nhave no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future \ntime, whether or not dividends on the Preferred are declared for any future Dividend Period.\nSo long as any share of Preferred remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the \nCompany’s common stock or any other shares of the Company’s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a \ndividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, \nredeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result \nof a reclassification of junior stock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of \n-46-\njunior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a \nsubstantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividends for the \nlatest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Preferred have been declared and paid (or \ndeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision \nshall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company’s other affiliates, to engage in \nany market-making transactions in the Company’s junior stock in the ordinary course of business.\nAs used in this description of the Preferred, “junior stock” means any class or series of stock of the Company \nthat ranks junior to the Preferred either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon \nany liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s junior stock includes the Company’s common stock.\nWhen dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend \nPayment Date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having Dividend Payment Dates different from \nthe Dividend Payment Dates pertaining to the Preferred, on a Dividend Payment Date falling within the related \nDividend Period for the Preferred) in full upon the Preferred and any shares of parity stock, all dividends \ndeclared upon the Preferred and all such equally ranking securities payable on such Dividend Payment Date \n(or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates \npertaining to the Preferred, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period for the \nPreferred) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio \nto each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Preferred and all parity stock payable on \nsuch Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the \ndividend payment dates pertaining to the Preferred, on a dividend payment date falling within the related \nDividend Period for the Preferred) bear to each other.\nAs used in this description of the Preferred, “parity stock” means any other class or series of stock of the \nCompany that ranks equally with the Preferred in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on \nany liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nSubject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the \nCompany’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the \nCompany’s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Preferred from time to time \nout of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Preferred shall not be entitled to \nparticipate in any such dividend.\nRedemption\nThe Preferred may be redeemed (but subject to applicable regulatory limits) in whole or in part, at the \nCompany’s option. Any such redemption will be at a cash redemption price of $100,000 per share, plus any \ndeclared and unpaid dividends including, without regard to any undeclared dividends. Holders of Preferred \nhave no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Preferred. If notice of redemption of any Preferred \nhas been given and if the funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company for the \nbenefit of the holders of any shares of the Preferred so called for redemption, then, from and after the \nredemption date, those shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those \nshares (including the right to receive any dividends) will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption \nprice.\nIf fewer than all of the outstanding shares of the Preferred are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed will \nbe selected either pro rata from the holders of record of shares of the Preferred in proportion to the number of \nshares held by those holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Company’s board of directors or a \ncommittee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable.\nThe Company will mail notice of every redemption of Preferred by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed \nto the holders of record of the Preferred to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the \nCompany’s books. This mailing will be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for \n-47-\nredemption (provided that if the Preferred is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Company may give this \nnotice in any manner permitted by DTC). Any notice mailed or otherwise given as provided in this paragraph \nwill be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives this notice, and \nfailure duly to give this notice by mail or otherwise, or any defect in this notice or in the mailing or provision of \nthis notice, to any holder of Preferred designated for redemption will not affect the redemption of any other \nPreferred. If the Company redeems the Preferred, the Trust, as holder of the Preferred, will redeem the \ncorresponding APEX as described under “— Mandatory Redemption of APEX upon Redemption of Preferred.”\nEach notice shall state:\n•\nthe redemption date;\n•\nthe number of shares of the Preferred to be redeemed and, if less than all shares of the \nPreferred held by the holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from \nthe holder;\n•\nthe redemption price; and\n•\nthe place or places where the Preferred is to be redeemed.\nThe Company’s right to redeem the Preferred once issued is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve \nBoard (or any successor banking agency).\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the \nPreferred are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after \nsatisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock \nor of any of the Company’s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of the \nPreferred, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $100,000 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends, \nwithout accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of the Preferred are not entitled to any other \namounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference.\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full \nto all holders of the Preferred and all holders of any other shares of the Company’s stock ranking equally as to \nsuch distribution with the Preferred, the amounts paid to the holders of the Preferred and to the holders of all \nsuch other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of \nthose holders. In any such distribution, the “liquidation preference” of any holder of preferred stock means the \namount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any \nunpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a \ncumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of Preferred and any other \nshares of the Company’s stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company’s \nother stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights \nand preferences.\nFor purposes of this description of the Preferred, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other \nentity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Preferred receive cash, securities or property \nfor their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, \nsecurities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nVoting Rights\nExcept as provided below, the holders of the Preferred have no voting rights.\n-48-\nWhenever dividends on any shares of the Preferred shall have not been declared and paid for a period the \nequivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not consecutive, equivalent to at least 18 months \nDividend Periods (as used in this section, a “Nonpayment”), the holders of such shares, voting together as a \nclass with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will \nbe entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company’s board of directors (as \nused in this section, the “Preferred Stock Directors”), provided that the election of any such director shall not \ncause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any \nother exchange on which the Company’s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority \nof independent directors and provided further that the Company’s board of directors shall at no time include \nmore than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company’s board of \ndirectors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called \nat the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Preferred or of any other series of voting preferred \nstock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special \nmeeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting \nof stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on \nthe shares of the Preferred and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least one year four Dividend \nPeriods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a \nsum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment).\nAs used in this description of the Preferred, “voting preferred stock” means any other class or series of \npreferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Preferred either as to dividends or the distribution of \nassets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and \nare exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of the Preferred and any other \nvoting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the \nliquidation amounts of the shares voted.\nIf and when dividends for at least four Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment \nhave been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the \nholders of the Preferred shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of \neach subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have \nterminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of \ndirectors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have \nbeen paid for at least four Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, the Company may take account of any \ndividend the Company elects to pay for a Dividend Period after the regular dividend date for that period has \npassed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a \nmajority of the outstanding shares of the Preferred when they have the voting rights described above (voting \ntogether as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall \ncontinue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a \nNonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none \nremains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Preferred and \nall voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class). The \nPreferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of the Preferred remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote \nor consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Preferred and all other series of \nvoting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, \neither in writing or at a meeting:\n•\nauthorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Preferred with respect \nto payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up \nof the Company;\n•\namend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation so \nas to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting \npowers of the Preferred, taken as a whole; or\n-49-\n•\nconsummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Preferred or a merger \nor consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of the \nPreferred remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect \nto which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged \nfor preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such \nshares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such \nrights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less \nfavorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of \nthe Preferred, taken as a whole;\nprovided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Preferred or other authorized \npreferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series \nof preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Preferred with respect to the payment of dividends \n(whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, \ndissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, \nprivileges or voting powers of the Preferred.\nIf an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above \nwould adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Preferred for this \npurpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of \npreferred stock.\nWithout the consent of the holders of the Preferred, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, \npreferences, privileges and voting powers of the Preferred, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or \nrepeal any terms of the Preferred:\n•\nto cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the \ncertificate of designations for the Preferred that may be defective or inconsistent; or\n•\nto make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the \nPreferred that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations.\nThe foregoing voting provisions do not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such \nvote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of the Preferred shall have been \nredeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the \nCompany for the benefit of the holders of the Preferred to effect such redemption.\nForm\nThe Preferred are issued only in fully registered form. Other than the fractional shares currently held by each \nTrust, no fractional shares will be issued unless a Trust is dissolved and the Company delivers the shares, \nrather than depositary receipts representing the shares, to the registered holders of its APEX. If a Trust is \ndissolved and depositary receipts or shares of the Preferred held by the Trust are distributed to holders of its \nAPEX, the Company would intend to distribute them in book-entry form only and the procedures governing \nholding and transferring beneficial interests in the Preferred, and the circumstances in which holders of \nbeneficial interests will be entitled to receive certificates evidencing their shares or depositary receipts. If the \nCompany determines to issue depositary shares representing fractional interests in the Preferred, each \ndepositary share will be represented by a depositary receipt. In such an event, the Preferred represented by the \ndepositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, a depositary and the \nholders from time to time of the depositary receipts representing depositary shares. Subject to the terms and \nconditions of any deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, through the depositary, \nin proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of the Preferred represented by such depositary share, to all \nthe rights applicable fraction of a share of the Preferred represented by such depositary share, to all the rights \nand preferences of the Preferred represented thereby (including dividends, voting, redemption and liquidation \nrights).\n-50-\nTitle\nThe Company, the transfer agent and registrar for the Preferred held by a Trust, and any of their agents may \ntreat the registered owner of the Preferred, which shall be the Property Trustee unless and until the Trust is \ndissolved, as the absolute owner of that stock, whether or not any payment for the Preferred shall be overdue \nand despite any notice to the contrary, for any purpose.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nIf a Trust is dissolved and shares of the Preferred held by the Trust or depositary receipts representing the \nPreferred are distributed to holders of APEX, the Company may appoint a transfer agent, registrar, calculation \nagent, redemption agent and dividend disbursement agent for the Preferred. The registrar for the Preferred will \nsend notices to shareholders of any meetings at which holders of the Preferred have the right to vote on any \nmatter.\n-51-\nDESCRIPTION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES F, CALLABLE FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES \nDUE MARCH 2031 OF GS FINANCE CORP. (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE \nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)\nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the Callable Fixed and Floating Rate Notes, an issuance of \nMedium-Term Notes, Series F of GS Finance Corp. (“GSFC”) (the “Callable Notes”), which are fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by the Company. It does not purport to be complete. This description is subject to \nand qualified in its entirety by reference to the Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2008, among \nGSFC, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented \nby the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 20, 2015, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated \nas of August 21, 2018 and the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2020 (collectively, the \n“GSFC 2008 Indenture”), which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the \ncontext otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs \nGroup, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe GSFC 2008 indenture permits GSFC to issue, from time to time, different series of debt securities and, \nwithin each different series of debt securities, different debt securities. The Medium-Term Notes, Series F are a \nsingle, distinct series of debt securities. GSFC may, however, issue notes in such amounts, at such times and \non such terms as GSFC wishes. The notes of the Medium-Term Notes, Series F may differ from one another, \nand from other series, in their terms. \nIn this description, references to a series of debt securities mean a series issued under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture, such as the notes issued under GSFC’s Medium-Term Notes, Series F program.\nTerms of the Callable Notes\nThe Callable Notes were originally issued on March 11, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of March 11, \n2031 (the “stated maturity date”). As noted above, the Callable Notes are part of a series of debt securities, \nentitled “Medium-Term Notes, Series F,” that GSFC may issue under the GSFC 2008 Indenture from time to \ntime. The Callable Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Bonds Market under the ticker symbol \n“GS/31B.”\nThe payment of principal of, and any interest and premium on, the Callable Notes is fully and unconditionally \nguaranteed by the Company. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire principal of, and interest and \npremium, if any, on, the Callable Notes has been paid in full or discharged in accordance with the provisions of \nthe GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by GSFC or by the Company. The guarantee of senior \ndebt securities of GSFC, such as the Callable Notes, will rank equally in right of payment to all senior \nindebtedness of the Company.\nPayment of Principal on Stated Maturity Date\nGSFC will pay holders of Callable Notes that have not been redeemed by the stated maturity date an amount in \ncash equal to the outstanding face amount of such holders’ Callable Notes. The stated maturity date of the \nCallable Notes is March 11, 2031, subject to GSFC’s early redemption right. If the stated maturity date falls on \na day that is not a business day, payment of principal otherwise due on such day will be made on the next \nsucceeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the stated \nmaturity date.\nInterest Payments\nFor each fixed rate interest period, the fixed interest rate on the Callable Notes will equal 5% per annum. For \neach floating rate interest period, the floating interest rate on the Callable Notes will be based upon the CMS \nspread on the relevant interest determination date for such floating rate interest period and will be a rate per \nannum equal to: \n-52-\n•\nif (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25% times (ii) 6.5 is greater than or equal to the maximum \ninterest rate, the maximum interest rate;\n•\nif (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25% times (ii) 6.5 is less than the maximum interest rate but \ngreater than the minimum interest rate, (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25% times (ii) 6.5; or\n•\nif (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25% times (ii) 6.5 is equal to or less than the minimum interest \nrate, the minimum interest rate.\nThe maximum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 10% per annum. Based on the formula used to calculate \nthe floating interest rate on the Callable Notes, holders will not benefit from any increases in the CMS spread \nminus 0.25% above approximately 1.54%. The minimum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 0% per annum.\nThe term “fixed rate interest periods” means the periods from and including a fixed rate interest payment date \n(or the original issue date, in the case of the first fixed rate interest period) to but excluding the next succeeding \nfixed rate interest payment date, where the term “fixed rate interest payment dates” means March 11, June 11, \nSeptember 11 and December 11 of each year, commencing on June 11, 2021 and ending on March 11, 2022, \nsubject to adjustments as described below.\nThe term “floating rate interest periods” means the periods from and including a floating rate interest payment \ndate (or the final fixed rate interest payment date, in the case of the first floating rate interest period) to but \nexcluding the next succeeding floating rate interest payment date (or the stated maturity date, in the case of the \nfinal floating rate interest period), where the term “floating rate interest payment dates” means March 11, June \n11, September 11 and December 11 of each year, beginning on June 11, 2022 and ending on the stated \nmaturity date, subject to adjustments as described below.\nThe term “interest determination dates” means, for each floating rate interest period, the second U.S. \ngovernment securities business day preceding such floating rate interest period.\nThe term “CMS spread” means, on any interest determination date, the 30-year CMS rate minus the 5-year \nCMS rate, as described under “— CMS Rate” below.\nThe calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest payable on each fixed rate interest payment date and \nfloating rate interest payment date (each, an “interest payment date”) for the applicable fixed rate interest \nperiod and floating rate interest period (each, an “interest period”) in the following manner. For each $1,000 \nface amount of the Callable Notes and for each interest period, the calculation agent will calculate the amount \nof interest to be paid by calculating the product of (i) the $1,000 face amount times (ii) the applicable fixed \ninterest rate or floating interest rate times (iii) the applicable day count convention on a 30/360 (ISDA) basis.\nInterest will be paid on the Callable Notes on each quarterly interest payment date. If an interest payment date \n(other than the interest payment date that falls on the stated maturity date) falls on a day that is not a business \nday, the payment due on such interest payment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day; \nprovided that interest due with respect to such interest payment date shall not accrue from and including such \ninterest payment date to and including the date of payment of such interest as so postponed. If the stated \nmaturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, payment of interest otherwise due on such day will be \nmade on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from \nand after the stated maturity date.\nCMS Rate\nReferences to the 30-year CMS rate or the 5-year CMS rate on an interest determination date mean the rate \nappearing on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 for 30-year or 5-year index maturity, as the case may be, as of \napproximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such interest determination date. If a CMS rate cannot be \ndetermined in this manner on the relevant interest determination date, the following procedures will apply to the \nCallable Notes.\n-53-\nIf the calculation agent determines on an interest determination date that a CMS rate has been discontinued, \nthen the calculation agent will use a substitute or successor rate that it has determined in its sole discretion is \nmost comparable to the applicable CMS rate, provided that if the calculation agent determines there is an \nindustry-accepted successor rate, then the calculation agent shall use such successor rate. If the calculation \nagent has determined a substitute or successor rate in accordance with the foregoing, the calculation agent in \nits sole discretion may determine the business day convention, the applicable business days and the interest \ndetermination dates to be used, and any other relevant methodology for calculating such substitute or \nsuccessor rate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor rate comparable \nto the applicable CMS rate, in a manner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices for such \nsubstitute or successor rate.\nUnless the calculation agent uses a substitute or successor rate as so provided, if the CMS rate cannot be \ndetermined in the manner described above, the applicable CMS rate for that interest determination date will be \ndetermined by the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to the foregoing \ndisplay page, or any other source it deems reasonable, in its sole discretion.\nThe applicable CMS rate will be subject to the corrections, if any, published on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 \nwithin one hour of the time that rate was first displayed on such source.\nThe term “Refinitiv page ICESWAP1” means the display on the Refinitiv Eikon service, or any successor or \nreplacement service, on the page ICESWAP1, or any successor or replacement page on that service.\nManner of Payment\nAny payment on the Callable Notes at maturity or upon redemption will be made to an account designated by \nthe holder of such Callable Notes and approved by GSFC, or at the office of the trustee in New York City, but \nonly when such Callable Notes are surrendered to the trustee at that office. GSFC may pay interest on any \ninterest payment date by check mailed to the person who is the holder on the regular record date. GSCF also \nmay make any payment in accordance with the applicable procedures of the depositary.\nModified Business Day\nAny payment on the Callable Notes that would otherwise be due on a day that is not a business day may \ninstead be paid on the next day that is a business day, with the same effect as if paid on the original due date. \nFor the Callable Notes, however, the term business day may have a different meaning than it does for other \nSeries F medium-term notes, as described under “— Special Calculation Provisions” below.\nRole of Calculation Agent\nThe calculation agent in its sole discretion will make all determinations regarding the CMS spread, the 30-year \nCMS rate, the 5-year CMS rate, the interest determination dates, the regular record dates, the interest payable \non each interest payment date, U.S. government securities business days, business days, postponement of the \nstated maturity date and the amount payable on the Callable Notes at maturity or redemption, as applicable. \nAbsent manifest error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be final and binding on holders of the \nCallable Notes and GSFC, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“GS&Co.”), an affiliate of GSFC, is currently serving as the calculation agent as of \nthe date of this description. GSFC may change the calculation agent for the Callable Notes at any time after the \ndate of this prospectus supplement without notice and GS&Co. may resign as calculation agent at any time \nupon 60 days’ written notice to GSFC.\n-54-\nEarly Redemption Right\nGSFC may redeem the Callable Notes, at GSFC’s option, in whole but not in part, on the interest payment date \nfalling on March 11, 2022 and on each interest payment date occurring thereafter, for an amount equal to 100% \nof the face amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nIf GSFC chooses to exercise its early redemption right, it will notify the holder of the Callable Notes and the \ntrustee by giving at least five business days’ prior notice. The day GSFC gives the notice, which will be a \nbusiness day, will be the redemption notice date and the immediately following interest payment date, which \nGSFC will state in the redemption notice, will be the redemption date. GSFC will not give a redemption notice \nthat results in a redemption date later than the stated maturity date.\nIf GSFC gives the holder a redemption notice, GSFC will redeem the entire outstanding face amount of such \nholder’s Callable Notes. On the redemption date, GSFC will pay to the holder of record on the business day \nimmediately preceding the redemption date, the redemption price in cash, together with any accrued and \nunpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, in the manner described under “— Manner of Payment” \nabove.\nSpecial Calculation Provisions\nThe term “business day” with respect to the Callable Notes means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or \nobligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.\nReferences to a U.S. government securities business day with respect to the Callable Notes mean any day \nexcept for a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association \nrecommends that the fixed income department of its members be closed for the entire day for purposes of \ntrading in U.S. government securities.\nDefeasance and Covenant Defeasance\nThe provisions for full defeasance and covenant defeasance in the GSFC 2008 Indenture do not apply to the \nCallable Notes.\nDefault, Remedies and Waiver of Default\nA holder will have special rights if an event of default with respect to his or her series of debt securities occurs \nand is continuing, as described in this subsection.\nEvents of Default\nReferences to an event of default with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following:\n•\nGSFC or the Company does not pay the principal or any premium on any debt security of that \nseries within 30 days after the due date;\n•\nGSFC or the Company does not pay interest on any debt security of that series within 30 days \nafter the due date; or\n•\nGSFC files for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating \nto GSFC occur. Those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law, unless GSFC \nmerges, consolidates or sells its assets as described above and the successor firm is a non-\nU.S. entity. If that happens, then those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law or the \nlaw of the jurisdiction in which the successor firm is legally organized.\n-55-\nAs described below under “Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs,” under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, events \nof bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company will not cause any of GSFC’s debt \nsecurities issued under such indenture to be automatically accelerated. In the event that the Company \nbecomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (but GSFC does not), any series \nof debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will not be immediately due and repayable. In \naddition, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, a breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company (including, for \nexample, a breach of the Company’s covenants and warranties with respect to mergers and similar \ntransactions or restrictions on liens) will not have the potential to cause any of GSFC’s debt securities issued \nunder the GSFC 2008 Indenture to be declared due and payable immediately. Instead, under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture, the trustee or holder will need to wait until the earlier of the time that (i) GSFC itself becomes subject \nto certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt \nsecurities, (ii) the Company otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities and (iii) the final maturity of \nthe debt securities. The return the holder receives on any series of debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture may be significantly less than what a holder would have otherwise received had the debt securities \nbeen automatically accelerated upon certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the \nCompany or declared due and payable immediately following the breach of a covenant or warranty by the \nCompany.\nCovenant Breaches\nReferences to a covenant breach with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following:\n•\nGSFC or the Company does not deposit a required sinking fund payment with regard to any \ndebt security of that series on the due date;\n•\nGSFC remains in breach of any other covenant it makes in the GSFC 2008 Indenture for the \nbenefit of the relevant series for 60 days after GSFC and the Company receive a notice of \ndefault stating that GSFC is in breach and requiring GSFC to remedy the breach. The notice \nmust be sent by the trustee or the holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the relevant \nseries of debt securities then outstanding;\n•\nExcept as provided by the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the debt security of that series and the \nrelated guarantee, the guarantee ceases to be effective, or a court finds the guarantee to be \nunenforceable or invalid, or the Company denies its obligations as the guarantor.\nA covenant breach shall not be an event of default with respect to any security.\nRemedies If an Event of Default or Covenant Breach Occurs\nIf an event of default has occurred with respect to any series of debt securities and has not been cured or \nwaived, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all debt securities of that series \nthen outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series to be due \nimmediately. If the event of default occurs because of events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization \nrelating to GSFC, the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series will be automatically \naccelerated, without any action by the trustee or any holder.\nEach of the situations described above is called an acceleration of the stated maturity of the affected series of \ndebt securities. If the stated maturity of any series is accelerated and a judgment for payment has not yet been \nobtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may cancel the \nacceleration for the entire series.\nIf an event of default or a covenant breach occurs, the trustee will have special duties. In that situation, the \ntrustee will be obligated to use those of its rights and powers under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, and to use the \nsame degree of care and skill in doing so, that a prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or \nher own affairs.\n-56-\nExcept as described in the prior paragraph, the trustee is not required to take any action under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from \nexpenses and liability (i.e., an indemnity). If the trustee is provided with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to \nit, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, \nmethod and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the \ntrustee with respect to that series. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other \naction under the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to the debt securities of that series.\nBefore a holder bypasses the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to \nenforce its rights or protect its interests relating to any debt security, all of the following must occur:\n•\nThe holder must give the trustee written notice that an event of default or a covenant breach \nhas occurred, and the event of default or covenant breach must not have been cured or \nwaived;\n•\nThe holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all debt securities of a holder’s series \nmust make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and they or \nother holders must offer to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against \nthe cost and other liabilities of taking that action;\n•\nThe trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after the above steps have been taken; \nand\n•\nDuring those 60 days, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of a \nholder’s series must not have given the trustee directions that are inconsistent with the written \nrequest of the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of a \nholder’s series.\nA holder is entitled at any time, however, to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on his or her debt \nsecurity on or after its stated maturity (or, if the debt security is redeemable, on or after its redemption date).\nWaiver of Default\nThe holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of any series may waive a \ndefault for all debt securities of that series. If this happens, the default will be treated as if it has not occurred. \nNo one can waive a payment default on a holder’s debt security, however, without the approval of the particular \nholder of that debt security.\nGSFC and the Company Will Give the Trustee Information About Defaults Annually\nGSFC and the Company will furnish to the trustee every year a written statement, respectively, of two of their \nofficers certifying that to their knowledge GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, is in compliance with the \nGSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under it, or else specifying any default under the relevant \ndebt indenture. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “default” means any event which is, or after notice \nor lapse of time or both would become, an event of default or covenant breach.\nDefault Amount on Acceleration\nIf an event of default occurs and the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated, GSFC will pay the default \namount in respect of the principal of the Callable Notes at the maturity, instead of the amount payable on the \nCallable Notes as described earlier. \nFor the purpose of determining whether the holders of GSFC’s Medium-Term Notes Series F, which include the \nCallable Notes, are entitled to take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, GSFC will treat the outstanding \nface amount of each Callable Note as the outstanding principal amount of that note. Although the terms of the \nCallable Notes differ from those of the other Medium-Term Notes Series F, holders of specified percentages in \n-57-\nprincipal amount of all Medium-Term Notes Series F, together in some cases with other series of GSFC’s debt \nsecurities, will be able to take action affecting all the Medium-Term Notes Series F, including the Callable \nNotes, except with respect to certain Medium-Term Notes Series F, if the terms of such notes specify that the \nholders of specified percentages in the principal amount of all such notes must also consent to such action. \nThis action may involve changing some of the terms that apply to the Medium-Term Notes Series F, \naccelerating the maturity of the Medium-Term Notes Series F, after a default or waiving some of GSFC’s \nobligations under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. In addition, certain changes to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the \nCallable Notes that only affect certain debt securities may be made with the approval of holders of a majority of \nthe principal amount of such affected debt securities.\nGuarantee by the Company\nThe Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal of, and any interest and \npremium on, the Medium-Term Notes, Series F, which include the Callable Notes, when due and payable, \nwhether at the stated maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance \nwith the terms of the security and the GSFC 2008 Indenture. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire \nprincipal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, the debt securities has been paid in full or discharged in \naccordance with the provisions of the GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by the Company.\nThe guarantee by the Company of its debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will rank equally in \nright of payment with all senior indebtedness of the Company.\nMergers and Similar Transactions\nGSFC and the Company are generally permitted to merge or consolidate with another corporation or other \nentity. GSFC and the Company also permitted to sell their assets substantially as an entirety to another \ncorporation or other entity. With regard to any series of debt securities, however, GSFC or the Company may \nnot take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met:\n•\nIf the successor entity in the transaction is not GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, \nthe successor entity must be organized as a corporation, partnership or trust and must \nexpressly assume the obligations of GSFC or the Company under the debt securities of that \nseries and the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to that series. The successor entity may be \norganized under the laws of any jurisdiction, whether in the United States or elsewhere.\n•\nImmediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities of that series or the \nrelated guarantees has occurred and is continuing. For this purpose, “default under the debt \nsecurities of that series or the related guarantees” means an event of default or a covenant \nbreach with respect to that series or the related guarantees or any event that would be an \nevent of default with respect to that series or the related guarantees if the requirements for \ngiving GSFC or the Company default notice and for GSFC’s or the Company’s default having \nto continue for a specific period of time were disregarded.\nIf the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to debt securities of any series, neither GSFC nor \nthe Company will need to obtain the approval of the holders of those debt securities in order to merge or \nconsolidate or to sell assets of GSFC or the Company. Also, these conditions will apply only if GSFC or the \nCompany wishes to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell assets of GSFC or the Company \nsubstantially as an entirety to another entity. Neither GSFC nor the Company will need to satisfy these \nconditions if GSFC or the Company enters into other types of transactions, including any transaction in which \nGSFC or the Company acquire the stock or assets of another entity, any transaction that involves a change of \ncontrol of GSFC or the Company but in which GSFC or the Company does not merge or consolidate and any \ntransaction in which GSFC or the Company sells less than substantially all assets of GSFC or the Company. \nWhile GSFC is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, there is no requirement that it remain a \nsubsidiary.\n-58-\nAlso, if GSFC or the Company merges, consolidates or sells assets of GSFC or the Company substantially as \nan entirety and the successor is a non-U.S. entity, neither GSFC nor any successor would have any obligation \nto compensate a holder for any resulting adverse tax consequences relating to his or her debt securities.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, GSFC may sell or transfer its assets \nsubstantially as an entirety, in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that GSFC’s assets \nand the assets of its direct or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, \ntaken together, are not sold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not \nmajority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company. may sell or transfer its assets substantially as \nan entirety in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that the assets of the Company and its \ndirect or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, taken together, are not \nsold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not such subsidiaries.\nRestriction on Liens\nIn the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the Company promises, with respect to each series of senior debt securities, not \nto create, assume, incur or guarantee any debt for borrowed money that is secured by a lien on the voting or \nprofit participating equity ownership interests that the Company or any of its subsidiaries own in Goldman \nSachs & Co. LLC, or in any subsidiary of the Company that beneficially owns or holds, directly or indirectly, \nthose interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, unless the Company also secures the senior debt securities of \nthat series on an equal or priority basis with the other secured debt. The promise of the Company, however, is \nsubject to an important exception: it may secure debt for borrowed money with liens on those interests without \nsecuring the senior debt securities of any series if its board of directors determines that the liens do not \nmaterially detract from or interfere with the value or control of those interests, as of the date of the \ndetermination.\nExcept as noted above, the GSFC 2008 Indenture does not restrict the Company’s ability to put liens on its \ninterests in its subsidiaries other than Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, nor does the indenture restrict the \nCompany’s ability to sell or otherwise dispose of its interests in any of its subsidiaries, including Goldman \nSachs & Co. LLC. In addition, the restriction on liens in the GSFC 2008 Indenture applies only to liens that \nsecure debt for borrowed money. For example, liens imposed by operation of law, such as liens to secure \nstatutory obligations for taxes or workers’ compensation benefits, or liens the Company creates to secure \nobligations to pay legal judgments or surety bonds, would not be covered by this restriction.\nModification of the Debt Indenture and Waiver of Covenants\nThere are four types of changes GSFC and the Company can make to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt \nsecurities or series of debt securities and related guarantees issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture.\nChanges Requiring Each Holder’s Approval\nFirst, there are changes that cannot be made without the approval of the holder of each debt security affected \nby the change under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. Here is a list of those types of changes:\n•\nchange the stated maturity for any principal or interest payment on a debt security;\n•\nreduce the principal amount, the amount payable on acceleration of the stated maturity after a \ndefault, the interest rate or the redemption price for a debt security;\n•\npermit redemption of a debt security if not previously permitted;\n•\nimpair any right a holder may have to require repayment of its debt security;\n•\nchange the currency of any payment on a debt security;\n•\nchange the place of payment on a debt security;\n•\nimpair a holder’s right to sue for payment of any amount due on its debt security;\n•\nreduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected \nseries, taken\n-59-\n•\nseparately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or \nless than all of the debt securities of a series, the approval of whose holders is needed to \nchange the applicable debt indenture or those debt securities;\n•\nreduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected \nseries, taken separately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or \ndifferent series or less than all of the debt securities of a series, the consent of whose holders \nis needed to waive GSFC’s compliance with the applicable debt indenture or to waive \ndefaults; and\n•\nchange the provisions of the applicable debt indenture dealing with modification and waiver in \nany other respect, except to increase any required percentage referred to above or to add to \nthe provisions that cannot be changed or waived without approval of the holder of each \naffected debt security.\nChanges Not Requiring Approval\nThe second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the debt securities affected. These \nchanges are limited to clarifications and changes that would not adversely affect any debt securities of any \nseries in any material respect. Neither GSFC nor the Company needs any approval to make changes that \naffect only debt securities to be issued under the applicable indenture after the changes take effect.\nGSFC and the Company may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not adversely affect a particular \ndebt security, even if they affect other debt securities. In those cases, neither GSFC nor the Company needs to \nobtain the approval of the holder of the unaffected debt security; GSFC and the Company need only obtain any \nrequired approvals from the holders of the affected debt securities.\nChanges Requiring Majority Approval\nAny other change to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under such debt indenture would \nrequire the following approval:\n•\nIf the change affects only particular debt securities within a series, it must be approved by the \nholders of a majority in principal amount of such particular debt securities.\n•\nIf the change affects multiple debt securities of one or more series, it must be approved by the \nholders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities affected by the change, with all \nsuch affected debt securities voting together as one class for this purpose (and by the holders \nof a majority in principal amount of any affected debt securities that by their terms are entitled \nto vote separately).\nIn each case, the required approval must be given by written consent.\nThis would mean that modification of terms with respect to certain debt securities of a series could be \neffectuated under the GSFC 2008 Indenture without obtaining the consent of the holders of a majority in \nprincipal amount of other securities of such series that are not affected by such modification.\nThe same majority approval would be required for GSFC to obtain a waiver of any of its covenants in the GSFC \n2008 Indenture. GSFC’s covenants include the promises GSFC and the Company make about merging and, \nwith respect to the Company, putting liens on GSFC’s interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. If the holders \napprove a waiver of a covenant, neither GSFC nor the Company will have to comply with it. The holders, \nhowever, cannot approve a waiver of any provision in a particular debt security, or in the GSFC 2008 Indenture \nas it affects that debt security, that neither GSFC nor the Company can change without the approval of the \nholder of that debt security as described above in “— Changes Requiring Each Holder’s Approval,” unless that \nholder approves the waiver.\n-60-\nSpecial Rules for Action by Holders\nWhen holders take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as giving a notice of default, notice of \ncovenant breach, declaring an acceleration, approving any change or waiver or giving the trustee an \ninstruction, GSFC will apply the following rules.\nOnly Outstanding Debt Securities Are Eligible\nOnly holders of outstanding debt securities or the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series, as \napplicable, will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of such debt securities or the debt securities of \nthat series. Also, GSFC will count only outstanding debt securities in determining whether the various \npercentage requirements for taking action have been met. For these purposes, a debt security will not be \n“outstanding” if:\n•\nit has been surrendered for cancellation;\n•\nGSFC has deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or redemption;\n•\nGSFC has fully defeased it; or\n•\nGSFC or one of its affiliates, such as Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, is the owner.\nDetermining Record Dates for Action by Holders\nGSFC and the Company will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of \ndetermining the holders that are entitled to take action under a particular debt indenture. In certain limited \ncircumstances, only the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders. If GSFC, the Company \nor the trustee set a record date for an approval or other action to be taken by holders, that vote or action may \nbe taken only by persons or entities who are holders on the record date and must be taken during the period \nthat GSFC specifies for this purpose, or that the trustee specifies if it sets the record date. GSFC, the Company \nor the trustee, as applicable, may shorten or lengthen this period from time to time.\nThis period, however, may not extend beyond the 180th day after the record date for the action. In addition, \nrecord dates for any global debt security may be set in accordance with procedures established by the \ndepositary from time to time. Accordingly, record dates for global debt securities may differ from those for other \ndebt securities.\nForm of Callable Notes\nThe Callable Notes are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company and represented by a \nglobal note. GSFC will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global note except in limited \ncircumstances.\n-61-\nDESCRIPTION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES F, CALLABLE FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES \nDUE MAY 2031 OF GS FINANCE CORP. (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE \nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.) \nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the Callable Fixed and Floating Rate Notes, an issuance of \nMedium-Term Notes, Series F of GS Finance Corp. (“GSFC”) (the “Callable Notes”), which are fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by the Company. It does not purport to be complete. This description is subject to \nand qualified in its entirety by reference to the Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2008, among \nGSFC, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented \nby the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 20, 2015, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated \nas of August 21, 2018 and the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2020 (collectively, the \n“GSFC 2008 Indenture”), which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the \ncontext otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs \nGroup, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. \nThe GSFC 2008 indenture permits GSFC to issue, from time to time, different series of debt securities and, \nwithin each different series of debt securities, different debt securities. The Medium-Term Notes, Series F are a \nsingle, distinct series of debt securities. GSFC may, however, issue notes in such amounts, at such times and \non such terms as GSFC wishes. The notes of the Medium-Term Notes, Series F may differ from one another, \nand from other series, in their terms. \nIn this description, references to a series of debt securities mean a series issued under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture, such as the notes issued under GSFC’s Medium-Term Notes, Series F program. \nTerms of the Callable Notes \nThe Callable Notes were originally issued on May 28, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of May 28, 2031 \n(the “stated maturity date”). As noted above, the Callable Notes are part of a series of debt securities, entitled \n“Medium-Term Notes, Series F,” that GSFC may issue under the GSFC 2008 Indenture from time to time. The \nCallable Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Bonds Market under the ticker symbol “GS/31X.” \nThe payment of principal of, and any interest and premium on, the Callable Notes is fully and unconditionally \nguaranteed by the Company. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire principal of, and interest and \npremium, if any, on, the Callable Notes has been paid in full or discharged in accordance with the provisions of \nthe GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by GSFC or by the Company. The guarantee of senior \ndebt securities of GSFC, such as the Callable Notes, will rank equally in right of payment to all senior \nindebtedness of the Company. \nPayment of Principal on Stated Maturity Date \nGSFC will pay holders of Callable Notes that have not been redeemed by the stated maturity date an amount in \ncash equal to the outstanding face amount of such holders’ Callable Notes. The stated maturity date of the \nCallable Notes is May 28, 2031, subject to GSFC’s early redemption right. If the stated maturity date falls on a \nday that is not a business day, payment of principal otherwise due on such day will be made on the next \nsucceeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the stated \nmaturity date. \nInterest Payments \nFor each fixed rate interest period, the fixed interest rate on the Callable Notes will equal 4.25% per annum. For \neach floating rate interest period, the floating interest rate on the Callable Notes will be based upon the CMS \n-62-\nspread on the relevant interest determination date for such floating rate interest period and will be a rate per \nannum equal to: \n•\nif (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 is greater than or equal to the maximum interest rate, the \nmaximum interest rate; \n•\nif (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 is less than the maximum interest rate but greater than the \nminimum interest rate, (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25; or \n•\nif (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 is equal to or less than the minimum interest rate, the minimum \ninterest rate. \nThe maximum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 8% per annum. Based on the formula used to calculate the \nfloating interest rate on the Callable Notes, holders will not benefit from any increases in the CMS spread \nabove approximately 2.46%. The minimum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 1% per annum. \nThe term “fixed rate interest periods” means the periods from and including a fixed rate interest payment date \n(or the original issue date, in the case of the first fixed rate interest period) to but excluding the next succeeding \nfixed rate interest payment date, where the term “fixed rate interest payment dates” means February 28, May \n28, August 28 and November 28 of each year, commencing on August 28, 2021 and ending on May 28, 2023, \nsubject to adjustments as described below. \nThe term “floating rate interest periods” means the periods from and including a floating rate interest payment \ndate (or the final fixed rate interest payment date, in the case of the first floating rate interest period) to but \nexcluding the next succeeding floating rate interest payment date (or the stated maturity date, in the case of the \nfinal floating rate interest period), where the term “floating rate interest payment dates” February 28, May 28, \nAugust 28, and November 28 of each year, beginning on May 28, 2023 and ending on the stated maturity date, \nsubject to adjustments as described below. \nThe term “interest determination dates” means, for each floating rate interest period, the second U.S. \ngovernment securities business day preceding such floating rate interest period. \nThe term “CMS spread” means, on any interest determination date, the 30-year CMS rate minus the 5-year \nCMS rate, as described under “— CMS Rate” below. \nThe calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest payable on each fixed rate interest payment date and \nfloating rate interest payment date (each, an “interest payment date”) for the applicable fixed rate interest \nperiod and floating rate interest period (each, an “interest period”) in the following manner. For each $1,000 \nface amount of the Callable Notes and for each interest period, the calculation agent will calculate the amount \nof interest to be paid by calculating the product of (i) the $1,000 face amount times (ii) the applicable fixed \ninterest rate or floating interest rate times (iii) the applicable day count convention on a 30/360 (ISDA) basis. \nInterest will be paid on the Callable Notes on each quarterly interest payment date. If an interest payment date \n(other than the interest payment date that falls on the stated maturity date) falls on a day that is not a business \nday, the payment due on such interest payment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day; \nprovided that interest due with respect to such interest payment date shall not accrue from and including such \ninterest payment date to and including the date of payment of such interest as so postponed. If the stated \nmaturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, payment of interest otherwise due on such day will be \nmade on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from \nand after the stated maturity date. \nCMS Rate \n-63-\nReferences to the 30-year CMS rate or the 5-year CMS rate on an interest determination date mean the rate \nappearing on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 for 30-year or 5-year index maturity, as the case may be, as of \napproximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such interest determination date. If a CMS rate cannot be \ndetermined in this manner on the relevant interest determination date, the following procedures will apply to the \nCallable Notes. \nIf the calculation agent determines on an interest determination date that a CMS rate has been discontinued, \nthen the calculation agent will use a substitute or successor rate that it has determined in its sole discretion is \nmost comparable to the applicable CMS rate, provided that if the calculation agent determines there is an \nindustry-accepted successor rate, then the calculation agent shall use such successor rate. If the calculation \nagent has determined a substitute or successor rate in accordance with the foregoing, the calculation agent in \nits sole discretion may determine the business day convention, the applicable business days and the interest \ndetermination dates to be used, and any other relevant methodology for calculating such substitute or \nsuccessor rate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor rate comparable \nto the applicable CMS rate, in a manner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices for such \nsubstitute or successor rate. \nUnless the calculation agent uses a substitute or successor rate as so provided, if the CMS rate cannot be \ndetermined in the manner described above, the applicable CMS rate for that interest determination date will be \ndetermined by the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to the foregoing \ndisplay page, or any other source it deems reasonable, in its sole discretion. \nThe applicable CMS rate will be subject to the corrections, if any, published on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 \nwithin one hour of the time that rate was first displayed on such source. \nThe term “Refinitiv page ICESWAP1” means the display on the Refinitiv Eikon service, or any successor or \nreplacement service, on the page ICESWAP1, or any successor or replacement page on that service. \nManner of Payment \nAny payment on the Callable Notes at maturity or upon redemption will be made to an account designated by \nthe holder of such Callable Notes and approved by GSFC, or at the office of the trustee in New York City, but \nonly when such Callable Notes are surrendered to the trustee at that office. GSFC may pay interest on any \ninterest payment date by check mailed to the person who is the holder on the regular record date. GSCF also \nmay make any payment in accordance with the applicable procedures of the depositary. \nModified Business Day \nAny payment on the Callable Notes that would otherwise be due on a day that is not a business day may \ninstead be paid on the next day that is a business day, with the same effect as if paid on the original due date. \nFor the Callable Notes, however, the term business day may have a different meaning than it does for other \nSeries F medium-term notes, as described under “— Special Calculation Provisions” below. \nRole of Calculation Agent \nThe calculation agent in its sole discretion will make all determinations regarding the CMS spread, the 30-year \nCMS rate, the 5-year CMS rate, the interest determination dates, the regular record dates, the interest payable \non each interest payment date, U.S. government securities business days, business days, postponement of the \nstated maturity date and the amount payable on the Callable Notes at maturity or redemption, as applicable. \nAbsent manifest error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be final and binding on holders of the \nCallable Notes and GSFC, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent. \n-64-\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“GS&Co.”), an affiliate of GSFC, is currently serving as the calculation agent as of \nthe date of this description. GSFC may change the calculation agent for the Callable Notes at any time after the \ndate of this prospectus supplement without notice and GS&Co. may resign as calculation agent at any time \nupon 60 days’ written notice to GSFC. \nEarly Redemption Right \nGSFC may redeem the Callable Notes, at GSFC’s option, in whole but not in part, on the interest payment date \nfalling on May 28, 2022 and on each interest payment date occurring thereafter, for an amount equal to 100% \nof the face amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \nIf GSFC chooses to exercise its early redemption right, it will notify the holder of the Callable Notes and the \ntrustee by giving at least five business days’ prior notice. The day GSFC gives the notice, which will be a \nbusiness day, will be the redemption notice date and the immediately following interest payment date, which \nGSFC will state in the redemption notice, will be the redemption date. GSFC will not give a redemption notice \nthat results in a redemption date later than the stated maturity date. \nIf GSFC gives the holder a redemption notice, GSFC will redeem the entire outstanding face amount of such \nholder’s Callable Notes. On the redemption date, GSFC will pay to the holder of record on the business day \nimmediately preceding the redemption date, the redemption price in cash, together with any accrued and \nunpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, in the manner described under “— Manner of Payment” \nabove. \nSpecial Calculation Provisions \nThe term “business day” with respect to the Callable Notes means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or \nobligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. \nReferences to a U.S. government securities business day with respect to the Callable Notes mean any day \nexcept for a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association \nrecommends that the fixed income department of its members be closed for the entire day for purposes of \ntrading in U.S. government securities. \nDefeasance and Covenant Defeasance \nThe provisions for full defeasance and covenant defeasance in the GSFC 2008 Indenture do not apply to the \nCallable Notes. \nDefault, Remedies and Waiver of Default \nA holder will have special rights if an event of default with respect to his or her series of debt securities occurs \nand is continuing, as described in this subsection. \nEvents of Default \nReferences to an event of default with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following: \n•\nGSFC or the Company does not pay the principal or any premium on any debt security of that series \nwithin 30 days after the due date; \n•\nGSFC or the Company does not pay interest on any debt security of that series within 30 days after \nthe due date; or \n-65-\n•\nGSFC files for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to \nGSFC occur. Those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law, unless GSFC merges, \nconsolidates or sells its assets as described above and the successor firm is a non-U.S. entity. If that \nhappens, then those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law or the law of the jurisdiction in \nwhich the successor firm is legally organized. \nAs described below under “Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs,” under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, events \nof bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company will not cause any of GSFC’s debt \nsecurities issued under such indenture to be automatically accelerated. In the event that the Company \nbecomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (but GSFC does not), any series \nof debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will not be immediately due and repayable. In \naddition, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, a breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company (including, for \nexample, a breach of the Company’s covenants and warranties with respect to mergers and similar \ntransactions or restrictions on liens) will not have the potential to cause any of GSFC’s debt securities issued \nunder the GSFC 2008 Indenture to be declared due and payable immediately. Instead, under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture, the trustee or holder will need to wait until the earlier of the time that (i) GSFC itself becomes subject \nto certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt \nsecurities, (ii) the Company otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities and (iii) the final maturity of \nthe debt securities. The return the holder receives on any series of debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture may be significantly less than what a holder would have otherwise received had the debt securities \nbeen automatically accelerated upon certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the \nCompany or declared due and payable immediately following the breach of a covenant or warranty by the \nCompany. \nCovenant Breaches \nReferences to a covenant breach with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following: \n•\nGSFC or the Company does not deposit a required sinking fund payment with regard to any debt \nsecurity of that series on the due date;\n•\nGSFC remains in breach of any other covenant it makes in the GSFC 2008 Indenture for the benefit of \nthe relevant series for 60 days after GSFC and the Company receive a notice of default stating that \nGSFC is in breach and requiring GSFC to remedy the breach. The notice must be sent by the trustee \nor the holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities then \noutstanding;\n•\nExcept as provided by the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the debt security of that series and the related \nguarantee, the guarantee ceases to be effective, or a court finds the guarantee to be unenforceable or \ninvalid, or the Company denies its obligations as the guarantor.\nA covenant breach shall not be an event of default with respect to any security. \nRemedies If an Event of Default or Covenant Breach Occurs \nIf an event of default has occurred with respect to any series of debt securities and has not been cured or \nwaived, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all debt securities of that series \nthen outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series to be due \nimmediately. If the event of default occurs because of events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization \nrelating to GSFC, the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series will be automatically \naccelerated, without any action by the trustee or any holder. \nEach of the situations described above is called an acceleration of the stated maturity of the affected series of \ndebt securities. If the stated maturity of any series is accelerated and a judgment for payment has not yet been \nobtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may cancel the \nacceleration for the entire series. \n-66-\nIf an event of default or a covenant breach occurs, the trustee will have special duties. In that situation, the \ntrustee will be obligated to use those of its rights and powers under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, and to use the \nsame degree of care and skill in doing so, that a prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or \nher own affairs. \nExcept as described in the prior paragraph, the trustee is not required to take any action under the GSFC 2008 \nIndenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from \nexpenses and liability (i.e., an indemnity). If the trustee is provided with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to \nit, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, \nmethod and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the \ntrustee with respect to that series. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other \naction under the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to the debt securities of that series. \nBefore a holder bypasses the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to \nenforce its rights or protect its interests relating to any debt security, all of the following must occur: \n•\nThe holder must give the trustee written notice that an event of default or a covenant breach has \noccurred, and the event of default or covenant breach must not have been cured or waived; \n•\nThe holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all debt securities of a holder’s series must \nmake a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and they or other holders \nmust offer to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against the cost and other \nliabilities of taking that action; \n•\nThe trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after the above steps have been taken; and \n•\nDuring those 60 days, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of a holder’s \nseries must not have given the trustee directions that are inconsistent with the written request of the \nholders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of a holder’s series. \nA holder is entitled at any time, however, to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on his or her debt \nsecurity on or after its stated maturity (or, if the debt security is redeemable, on or after its redemption date). \nWaiver of Default \nThe holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of any series may waive a \ndefault for all debt securities of that series. If this happens, the default will be treated as if it has not occurred. \nNo one can waive a payment default on a holder’s debt security, however, without the approval of the particular \nholder of that debt security. \nGSFC and the Company Will Give the Trustee Information About Defaults Annually \nGSFC and the Company will furnish to the trustee every year a written statement, respectively, of two of their \nofficers certifying that to their knowledge GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, is in compliance with the \nGSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under it, or else specifying any default under the relevant \ndebt indenture. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “default” means any event which is, or after notice \nor lapse of time or both would become, an event of default or covenant breach."

    "text": "Default Amount on Acceleration \n-67-\nIf an event of default occurs and the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated, GSFC will pay the default \namount in respect of the principal of the Callable Notes at the maturity, instead of the amount payable on the \nCallable Notes as described earlier. \nFor the purpose of determining whether the holders of GSFC’s Medium-Term Notes Series F, which include the \nCallable Notes, are entitled to take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, GSFC will treat the outstanding \nface amount of each Callable Note as the outstanding principal amount of that note. Although the terms of the \nCallable Notes differ from those of the other Medium-Term Notes Series F, holders of specified percentages in \nprincipal amount of all Medium-Term Notes Series F, together in some cases with other series of GSFC’s debt \nsecurities, will be able to take action affecting all the Medium-Term Notes Series F, including the Callable \nNotes, except with respect to certain Medium-Term Notes Series F, if the terms of such notes specify that the \nholders of specified percentages in the principal amount of all such notes must also consent to such action. \nThis action may involve changing some of the terms that apply to the Medium-Term Notes Series F, \naccelerating the maturity of the Medium-Term Notes Series F, after a default or waiving some of GSFC’s \nobligations under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. In addition, certain changes to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the \nCallable Notes that only affect certain debt securities may be made with the approval of holders of a majority of \nthe principal amount of such affected debt securities. \nGuarantee by the Company \nThe Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal of, and any interest and \npremium on, the Medium-Term Notes, Series F, which include the Callable Notes, when due and payable, \nwhether at the stated maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance \nwith the terms of the security and the GSFC 2008 Indenture. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire \nprincipal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, the debt securities has been paid in full or discharged in \naccordance with the provisions of the GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by the Company. \nThe guarantee by the Company of its debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will rank equally in \nright of payment with all senior indebtedness of the Company. \nMergers and Similar Transactions \nGSFC and the Company are generally permitted to merge or consolidate with another corporation or other \nentity. GSFC and the Company also permitted to sell their assets substantially as an entirety to another \ncorporation or other entity. With regard to any series of debt securities, however, GSFC or the Company may \nnot take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: \n•\nIf the successor entity in the transaction is not GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, the \nsuccessor entity must be organized as a corporation, partnership or trust and must expressly \nassume the obligations of GSFC or the Company under the debt securities of that series and the \nGSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to that series. The successor entity may be organized under the \nlaws of any jurisdiction, whether in the United States or elsewhere. \n•\nImmediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities of that series or the related \nguarantees has occurred and is continuing. For this purpose, “default under the debt securities of \nthat series or the related guarantees” means an event of default or a covenant breach with respect to \nthat series or the related guarantees or any event that would be an event of default with respect to \nthat series or the related guarantees if the requirements for giving GSFC or the Company default \nnotice and for GSFC’s or the Company’s default having to continue for a specific period of time were \ndisregarded. \nIf the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to debt securities of any series, neither GSFC nor \nthe Company will need to obtain the approval of the holders of those debt securities in order to merge or \nconsolidate or to sell assets of GSFC or the Company. Also, these conditions will apply only if GSFC or the \nCompany wishes to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell assets of GSFC or the Company \n-68-\nsubstantially as an entirety to another entity. Neither GSFC nor the Company will need to satisfy these \nconditions if GSFC or the Company enters into other types of transactions, including any transaction in which \nGSFC or the Company acquire the stock or assets of another entity, any transaction that involves a change of \ncontrol of GSFC or the Company but in which GSFC or the Company does not merge or consolidate and any \ntransaction in which GSFC or the Company sells less than substantially all assets of GSFC or the Company. \nWhile GSFC is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, there is no requirement that it remain a \nsubsidiary. \nAlso, if GSFC or the Company merges, consolidates or sells assets of GSFC or the Company substantially as \nan entirety and the successor is a non-U.S. entity, neither GSFC nor any successor would have any obligation \nto compensate a holder for any resulting adverse tax consequences relating to his or her debt securities. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, GSFC may sell or transfer its assets \nsubstantially as an entirety, in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that GSFC’s assets \nand the assets of its direct or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, \ntaken together, are not sold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not \nmajority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company. may sell or transfer its assets substantially as \nan entirety in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that the assets of the Company and its \ndirect or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, taken together, are not \nsold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not such subsidiaries. \nRestriction on Liens \nIn the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the Company promises, with respect to each series of senior debt securities, not \nto create, assume, incur or guarantee any debt for borrowed money that is secured by a lien on the voting or \nprofit participating equity ownership interests that the Company or any of its subsidiaries own in Goldman \nSachs & Co. LLC, or in any subsidiary of the Company that beneficially owns or holds, directly or indirectly, \nthose interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, unless the Company also secures the senior debt securities of \nthat series on an equal or priority basis with the other secured debt. The promise of the Company, however, is \nsubject to an important exception: it may secure debt for borrowed money with liens on those interests without \nsecuring the senior debt securities of any series if its board of directors determines that the liens do not \nmaterially detract from or interfere with the value or control of those interests, as of the date of the \ndetermination. \nExcept as noted above, the GSFC 2008 Indenture does not restrict the Company’s ability to put liens on its \ninterests in its subsidiaries other than Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, nor does the indenture restrict the \nCompany’s ability to sell or otherwise dispose of its interests in any of its subsidiaries, including Goldman \nSachs & Co. LLC. In addition, the restriction on liens in the GSFC 2008 Indenture applies only to liens that \nsecure debt for borrowed money. For example, liens imposed by operation of law, such as liens to secure \nstatutory obligations for taxes or workers’ compensation benefits, or liens the Company creates to secure \nobligations to pay legal judgments or surety bonds, would not be covered by this restriction. \nModification of the Debt Indenture and Waiver of Covenants \nThere are four types of changes GSFC and the Company can make to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt \nsecurities or series of debt securities and related guarantees issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. \nChanges Requiring Each Holder’s Approval \nFirst, there are changes that cannot be made without the approval of the holder of each debt security affected \nby the change under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. Here is a list of those types of changes: \n•\nchange the stated maturity for any principal or interest payment on a debt security; \n-69-\n•\nreduce the principal amount, the amount payable on acceleration of the stated maturity after a default, \nthe interest rate or the redemption price for a debt security; \n•\npermit redemption of a debt security if not previously permitted; \n•\nimpair any right a holder may have to require repayment of its debt security; \n•\nchange the currency of any payment on a debt security; \n•\nchange the place of payment on a debt security; \n•\nimpair a holder’s right to sue for payment of any amount due on its debt security; \n•\nreduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected series, \ntaken \n•\nseparately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or less than \nall of the debt securities of a series, the approval of whose holders is needed to change the applicable \ndebt indenture or those debt securities; \n•\nreduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected series, \ntaken separately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or \nless than all of the debt securities of a series, the consent of whose holders is needed to waive \nGSFC’s compliance with the applicable debt indenture or to waive defaults; and \n•\nchange the provisions of the applicable debt indenture dealing with modification and waiver in any \nother respect, except to increase any required percentage referred to above or to add to the provisions \nthat cannot be changed or waived without approval of the holder of each affected debt security. \nChanges Not Requiring Approval \nThe second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the debt securities affected. These \nchanges are limited to clarifications and changes that would not adversely affect any debt securities of any \nseries in any material respect. Neither GSFC nor the Company needs any approval to make changes that \naffect only debt securities to be issued under the applicable indenture after the changes take effect. \nGSFC and the Company may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not adversely affect a particular \ndebt security, even if they affect other debt securities. In those cases, neither GSFC nor the Company needs to \nobtain the approval of the holder of the unaffected debt security; GSFC and the Company need only obtain any \nrequired approvals from the holders of the affected debt securities. \nChanges Requiring Majority Approval \nAny other change to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under such debt indenture would \nrequire the following approval: \n•\nIf the change affects only particular debt securities within a series, it must be approved by the \nholders of a majority in principal amount of such particular debt securities. \n•\nIf the change affects multiple debt securities of one or more series, it must be approved by the \nholders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities affected by the change, with all such \naffected debt securities voting together as one class for this purpose (and by the holders of a \nmajority in principal amount of any affected debt securities that by their terms are entitled to vote \nseparately). \nIn each case, the required approval must be given by written consent. \nThis would mean that modification of terms with respect to certain debt securities of a series could be \neffectuated under the GSFC 2008 Indenture without obtaining the consent of the holders of a majority in \nprincipal amount of other securities of such series that are not affected by such modification. \nThe same majority approval would be required for GSFC to obtain a waiver of any of its covenants in the GSFC \n2008 Indenture. GSFC’s covenants include the promises GSFC and the Company make about merging and, \nwith respect to the Company, putting liens on GSFC’s interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. If the holders \n-70-\napprove a waiver of a covenant, neither GSFC nor the Company will have to comply with it. The holders, \nhowever, cannot approve a waiver of any provision in a particular debt security, or in the GSFC 2008 Indenture \nas it affects that debt security, that neither GSFC nor the Company can change without the approval of the \nholder of that debt security as described above in “— Changes Requiring Each Holder’s Approval,” unless that \nholder approves the waiver. \nSpecial Rules for Action by Holders \nWhen holders take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as giving a notice of default, notice of \ncovenant breach, declaring an acceleration, approving any change or waiver or giving the trustee an \ninstruction, GSFC will apply the following rules. \nOnly Outstanding Debt Securities Are Eligible \nOnly holders of outstanding debt securities or the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series, as \napplicable, will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of such debt securities or the debt securities of \nthat series. Also, GSFC will count only outstanding debt securities in determining whether the various \npercentage requirements for taking action have been met. For these purposes, a debt security will not be \n“outstanding” if: \n•\nit has been surrendered for cancellation; \n•\nGSFC has deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or redemption; \n•\nGSFC has fully defeased it; or \n•\nGSFC or one of its affiliates, such as Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, is the owner. \nDetermining Record Dates for Action by Holders \nGSFC and the Company will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of \ndetermining the holders that are entitled to take action under a particular debt indenture. In certain limited \ncircumstances, only the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders. If GSFC, the Company \nor the trustee set a record date for an approval or other action to be taken by holders, that vote or action may \nbe taken only by persons or entities who are holders on the record date and must be taken during the period \nthat GSFC specifies for this purpose, or that the trustee specifies if it sets the record date. GSFC, the Company \nor the trustee, as applicable, may shorten or lengthen this period from time to time. \nThis period, however, may not extend beyond the 180th day after the record date for the action. In addition, \nrecord dates for any global debt security may be set in accordance with procedures established by the \ndepositary from time to time. Accordingly, record dates for global debt securities may differ from those for other \ndebt securities. \nForm of Callable Notes \nThe Callable Notes are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company and represented by a \nglobal note. GSFC will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global note except in limited \ncircumstances. \n-71-\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nOutside Director __________ RSU Award\nThis Award Agreement, together with The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive \nPlan (2021) (the “Plan”), governs your __________ award of RSUs (your “Award”) [that will be \ngranted to you as set forth on your Award Statement].

The provisions of this \nParagraph 10 apply to you only if you are a U.S. taxpayer.\n(a)\nThis Award Agreement and the Plan provisions that apply to this Award are \nintended and will be construed to comply with Section 409A (including the requirements \napplicable to, or the conditions for exemption from treatment as, 409A Deferred Compensation), \nwhether by reason of short-term deferral treatment or other exceptions or provisions.  The \nCommittee will have full authority to give effect to this intent. To the extent necessary to give \neffect to this intent, in the case of any conflict or potential inconsistency between the provisions \nof the Plan (including Sections 1.3.2 and 2.1 thereof) and this Award Agreement, the provisions \nof this Award Agreement will govern, and in the case of any conflict or potential inconsistency \nbetween this Paragraph 10 and the other provisions of this Award Agreement, this Paragraph 10 \nwill govern.\n(b)\nDelivery of RSU Shares will not be delayed beyond the date on which all \napplicable conditions or restrictions on delivery of RSU Shares required by this Agreement \n(including those specified in Paragraphs 4, 6(b) and 7 and the consents and other items specified \nin Section 3.3 of the Plan) are satisfied, and will occur by December 31 of the calendar year in \nwhich the Delivery Date occurs unless, in order to permit such conditions or restrictions to be \nsatisfied, the Committee elects, pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be \npermitted in accordance with Section 409A, to delay delivery of RSU Shares to a later date as \nmay be permitted under Section 409A, including Reg. 1.409A-3(d).  For the avoidance of doubt, \nif the Award includes a “series of installment payments” as described in Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), \nyour right to the series of installment payments will be treated as a right to a series of separate \npayments and not as a right to a single payment.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 7(b) and Section 1.3.2(i) of the \nPlan, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any securities, other Awards or other \nproperty that the Firm may deliver in respect of your RSUs will not have the effect of deferring \ndelivery or payment, income inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the date on \nwhich such delivery, payment or inclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, \nwith respect to the RSU Shares that would otherwise have been deliverable (unless the \nCommittee elects a later date for this purpose pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise \nas may be permitted under Section 409A, including and to the extent applicable, the subsequent \nelection provisions of Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. 1.409A-2(b)).\n(d)\nNotwithstanding the timing provisions of Paragraph 6(b), the delivery of RSU \nShares referred to therein will be made after the date of death and during the calendar year that \nincludes the date of death (or on such later date as may be permitted under Section 409A).\n(e)\nNotwithstanding any provision of Paragraph 5 or Section 2.8.2 of the Plan to the \ncontrary, the Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to each of your Outstanding RSUs will be \npaid to you within the calendar year that includes the date of distribution of any corresponding \nregular cash dividends paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock the record date for \nwhich occurs on or after the [applicable] Date of Grant.  The payment will be in an amount (less \napplicable withholding) equal to such regular dividend payment as would have been made in \nrespect of the RSU Shares underlying such Outstanding RSUs.\n(f)\nThe timing of delivery or payment referred to in Paragraph 6(a)(i) will be the \nearlier of (i) the Delivery Date or (ii) within the calendar year in which the Committee receives \nsatisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment, provided that such delivery \nor payment will be made, and any Committee action referred to in Paragraph 6(a)(i) will be taken, \nonly at such time as, and if and to the extent that it, as reasonably determined by the Firm, would \nnot result in the imposition of any additional tax to you under Section 409A.  \n(g)\nSection 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A Deferred \nCompensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n- 3 -\n(h)\nDelivery of RSU Shares in respect of this Award may be made, if and to the \nextent elected by the Committee, later than the Delivery Date or other date or period specified \nhereinabove (but, in the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to \nthe extent that the later delivery is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(i)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any \ntaxes and penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to \ndesignate, directly or indirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.\nAmendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting\n11.\nAmendment.  The Committee reserves the right at any time to amend the terms of this \nAward Agreement, and the Board may amend the Plan in any respect; provided, that, notwithstanding the \nforegoing and Sections 1.3.2(f), 1.3.2(h) and 3.1 of the Plan, no such amendment will materially \nadversely affect your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement without your consent; and \nprovided further, that the Committee expressly reserves the right to accelerate the delivery of the RSU \nShares and in its discretion to provide that such Shares may not be transferable until the Delivery Date.  A \nmodification that impacts the tax consequences of this Award or the timing of delivery of RSU Shares \nwill not be an amendment that materially adversely affects your rights and obligations under this Award \nAgreement.  Any amendment of this Award Agreement will be in writing.\n12.\nConstruction, Headings.  Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) words describing \nthe singular number include the plural and vice versa, (b) words denoting any gender include all genders \nand (c) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words \n“without limitation.”  The headings in this Award Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and \nare not intended to define or limit the construction of the provisions hereof.  References in this Award \nAgreement to any specific Plan provision will not be construed as limiting the applicability of any other \nPlan provision.\n13.\nProviding Information to the Appropriate Authorities.

For the \navoidance of doubt, governmental authority includes Federal, state and local government agencies such as \nthe SEC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and any state or local human rights agency \n(e.g., the New York State Division of Human Rights, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, \nthe California Civil Rights Department), as well as law enforcement (e.g., the state Attorney General and \nthe U.S. Department of Justice).  Similarly, nothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan prohibits you \nfrom speaking with your own attorney regarding your own legal rights or obligations.  In addition, \nnothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan limits your ability to use the internal and external reporting \nchannels that are available to you, as described in the Firmwide Policy on Escalation.\n- 4 -\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, GS Inc. has caused this Award Agreement to be duly \nexecuted and delivered as of the [applicable] Date of Grant [for each Award granted hereunder].\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.\nAccepted and Agreed:\nBy:  ____________________________\nPrint Name:\n- 5 -\nDefinitions Appendix\nThe following capitalized terms are used in this Award Agreement with the following meanings:\n(a) “409A Deferred Compensation” means a “deferral of compensation” or “deferred \ncompensation” as those terms are defined in the regulations under Section 409A.  \nThe following capitalized terms are used in this Award Agreement with the meanings that are \nassigned to them in the Plan.   \n(a) “Account” means any brokerage account, custody account or similar account, as \napproved or required by GS Inc. from time to time, into which shares of Common Stock, cash or other \nproperty in respect of an Award are delivered.\n(b) “Award Agreement” means the written document or documents by which each Award is \nevidenced, including any related Award Statement and signature card.\n(c) “Award Statement” means a written statement that reflects certain Award terms.\n(d) “Board” means the Board of Directors of GS Inc.\n(e) “Business Day” means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which \nbanking institutions in New York City are authorized or obligated by Federal law or executive order to be \nclosed.\n(f) “Certificate” means a stock certificate (or other appropriate document or evidence of \nownership) representing shares of Common Stock.\n(g) “Committee” means the committee appointed by the Board to administer the Plan \npursuant to Section 1.3, and, to the extent the Board determines it is appropriate for the compensation \nrealized from Awards under the Plan to be considered “performance based” compensation under \nSection 162(m) of the Code, shall be a committee or subcommittee of the Board composed of two or \nmore members, each of whom is an “outside director” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), and \nwhich, to the extent the Board determines it is appropriate for Awards under the Plan to qualify for the \nexemption available under Rule 16b-3(d)(1) or Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall \nbe a committee or subcommittee of the Board composed of two or more members, each of whom is a \n“non-employee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Award includes a “series of installment \npayments” as described in Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), your right to the series of installment \npayments will be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single \npayment.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding Section 1.3.2(i) of the Plan, to the extent necessary to comply \nwith Section 409A, any payments that the Firm may make in respect of your RSUs will not have \nthe effect of deferring payment, income inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the \ndate on which such payment or inclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with \nrespect to the RSU Payment Amount that would otherwise have been payable (unless the \nCommittee elects a later date for this purpose pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise \nas may be permitted under Section 409A, including and to the extent applicable, the subsequent \nelection provisions of Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. 1.409A-2(b)).\n(d)\nNotwithstanding the timing provisions of Paragraph 6(b), the Payment of the \nRSU Payment Amount referred to therein will be made after the date of death and during the \ncalendar year that includes the date of death (or on such later date as may be permitted under \nSection 409A).\n(e)\nNotwithstanding any provision of Paragraph 5 or Section 2.8.2 of the Plan to the \ncontrary, the Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to each of your Outstanding RSUs will be \npaid to you within the calendar year that includes the date of distribution of any corresponding \nregular cash dividends paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock the record date for \nwhich occurs on or after the Date of Grant.  The payment will be in an amount (less applicable \nwithholding) equal to such regular dividend payment as would have been made in respect of the \nRSU Shares underlying such Outstanding RSUs.\n(f)\nThe timing of payment referred to in Paragraph 6(a)(i) will be the earlier of (i) \nthe Payment Date or (ii) within the calendar year in which the Committee receives satisfactory \ndocumentation relating to your Conflicted Employment, provided that such payment will be \nmade, and any Committee action referred to in Paragraph 6(a)(i) will be taken, only at such time \nas, and if and to the extent that it, as reasonably determined by the Firm, would not result in the \nimposition of any additional tax to you under Section 409A.  \n(g)\nSection 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A Deferred \nCompensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n(h)\nPayment of the RSU Payment Amount in respect of any RSUs may be made, if \nand to the extent elected by the Committee, later than the Payment Date or other date or period \nspecified hereinabove (but, in the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred \nCompensation, only to the extent that the later payment is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(i)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any \ntaxes and penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to \ndesignate, directly or indirectly, the taxable year of the payment.\nAmendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting\n11.\nAmendment.  The Committee reserves the right at any time to amend the terms of this \nAward Agreement, and the Board may amend the Plan in any respect; provided, that, notwithstanding the \nforegoing and Sections 1.3.2(f), 1.3.2(h) and 3.1 of the Plan, no such amendment will materially \n- 3 -\nadversely affect your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement without your consent; and \nprovided further, that the Committee expressly reserves the right to accelerate the payment of the RSU \nPayment Amount and in its discretion to provide that such payment may not be transferable until the \nPayment Date.  A modification that impacts the tax consequences of this Award or the timing of payment \nof the RSU Payment Amount will not be an amendment that materially adversely affects your rights and \nobligations under this Award Agreement.  Any amendment of this Award Agreement will be in writing.\n12.\nConstruction, Headings.  Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) words describing \nthe singular number include the plural and vice versa, (b) words denoting any gender include all genders \nand (c) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words \n“without limitation.”  The headings in this Award Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and \nare not intended to define or limit the construction of the provisions hereof.  References in this Award \nAgreement to any specific Plan provision will not be construed as limiting the applicability of any other \nPlan provision.\n13.\nProviding Information to the Appropriate Authorities.

For example, it specifies any applicable \nVesting Dates, Delivery Dates and Transferability Dates.  \n4.\nDefinitions.  Unless otherwise defined herein, including in the Definitions Appendix or \nany other Appendix, capitalized terms have the meanings provided in the Plan.  \nVesting of Your RSUs\n5.\nVesting.  On each Vesting Date listed on your Award Statement, you will become Vested \nin the amount of Outstanding RSUs listed next to that date.  When an RSU becomes Vested, it means \nonly that your continued active Employment is not required for delivery of that portion of RSU Shares.  \nVesting does not mean you have a non-forfeitable right to the Vested portion of your Award.  The \nterms of this Award Agreement (including conditions to delivery and any applicable Transfer \nRestrictions) continue to apply to Vested RSUs, and you can still forfeit Vested RSUs and any RSU \nShares.\nDelivery of Your RSU Shares\n6.\nDelivery.  Reasonably promptly (but no more than 30 Business Days) after each Delivery \nDate identified on your Award Statement, RSU Shares (less applicable withholding as described in \nParagraph 13(b)) will be delivered (by book entry credit to your Account) in respect of the amount of \nOutstanding RSUs listed next to that date.  The Committee may select multiple dates within the 30-\nBusiness-Day period following the Delivery Date to deliver RSU Shares in respect of all or a portion of \nthe RSUs with the same Delivery Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as \na single Delivery Date for purposes of this Award.

The Committee may select multiple dates within the 30-Business-Day period on which to remove \nTransfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Shares at Risk with the same Transferability Date, and all \nsuch dates will be treated as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award.  Any purported sale, \nexchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, fractionalization, hedge or other disposition in \nviolation of the Transfer Restrictions on Shares at Risk will be void.  [If your Award Statement does \nnot reflect any Transferability Date, then references to Transfer Restrictions and Shares at Risk in \nthis Award Agreement are inapplicable to your Award and this Paragraph 7 does not apply.]  \nDividends\n8.\n[Dividend Equivalent Rights and] Dividends.  [Each RSU includes a Dividend \nEquivalent Right, which entitles you to receive an amount (less applicable withholding), at or after the \ntime of distribution of any regular cash dividend paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock, \nequal to any regular cash dividend payment that would have been made in respect of an RSU Share \nunderlying your Outstanding RSUs for any record date that occurs on or after the Date of Grant.  In \naddition, you][You] will be entitled to receive on a current basis any regular cash dividend paid in respect \nof any Shares at Risk.  [The RSUs do not include Dividend Equivalent Rights.]\nForfeiture of Your Award\n9.\nHow You May Forfeit Your Award.

The provisions of this \nParagraph 18 apply to you only if you are a U.S. taxpayer.\n(a)\nThis Award Agreement and the Plan provisions that apply to this Award are intended and \nwill be construed to comply with Section 409A (including the requirements applicable to, or the \nconditions for exemption from treatment as, 409A Deferred Compensation), whether by reason of short-\nterm deferral treatment or other exceptions or provisions.  The Committee will have full authority to give \neffect to this intent.  To the extent necessary to give effect to this intent, in the case of any conflict or \npotential inconsistency between the provisions of the Plan (including Sections 1.3.2 and 2.1 thereof) and \nthis Award Agreement, the provisions of this Award Agreement will govern, and in the case of any \nconflict or potential inconsistency between this Paragraph 18 and the other provisions of this Award \nAgreement, this Paragraph 18 will govern.\n(b)\nDelivery of RSU Shares will not be delayed beyond the date on which all applicable \nconditions or restrictions on delivery of RSU Shares required by this Award Agreement (including those \nspecified in Paragraphs 6, 7, 11(a)(ii), 11(b), 12(c) and 13 and the consents and other items specified in \nSection 3.3 of the Plan) are satisfied.  To the extent that any portion of this Award is intended to satisfy \nthe requirements for short-term deferral treatment under Section 409A, delivery for such portion will \noccur by the March 15 coinciding with the last day of the applicable “short-term deferral” period \ndescribed in Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4) in order for the delivery of RSU Shares to be within the short-term \ndeferral exception unless, in order to permit all applicable conditions or restrictions on delivery to be \nsatisfied, the Committee elects, pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted \nin accordance with Section 409A, to delay delivery of RSU Shares to a later date within the same \ncalendar year or to such later date as may be permitted under Section 409A, including Reg. 1.409A-3(d).  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the Award includes a “series of installment payments” as described in Reg. \n1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), your right to the series of installment payments will be treated as a right to a series of \nseparate payments and not as a right to a single payment.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 13(e) and Section 1.3.2(i) of the Plan, to the \nextent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any securities, other Awards or other property that the \nFirm may deliver in respect of your RSUs will not have the effect of deferring delivery or payment, \nincome inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the date on which such delivery, payment or \ninclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with respect to the RSU Shares that would \notherwise have been deliverable (unless the Committee elects a later date for this purpose pursuant to \nReg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted under Section 409A, including and to the \nextent applicable, the subsequent election provisions of Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. \n1.409A-2(b)).\n(d)\nNotwithstanding the timing provisions of Paragraph 12(c), the delivery of RSU Shares \nreferred to therein will be made after the date of death and not later than the end of the calendar year \nfollowing the calendar year that includes the date of death (or on such later date as may be permitted \nunder Section 409A).\n(e)\nThe timing of delivery or payment pursuant to Paragraph 12(a) will occur on the earlier \nof (i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the termination of \nEmployment occurs; provided, however, that if you are a “specified employee” (as defined by the Firm in \naccordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(i)(B) of the Code), delivery will occur on the earlier of the Delivery \nDate or (to the extent required to avoid the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A) the date that \nis six months after your termination of Employment (or, if the latter date is not during a Window Period, \nthe first trading day of the next Window Period).  For purposes of Paragraph 12(a), references in this \n- 10 -\nAward Agreement to termination of Employment mean a termination of Employment from the Firm (as \ndefined by the Firm) which is also a separation from service (as defined by the Firm in accordance with \nSection 409A).\n(f)\n[Notwithstanding any provision of Paragraph 8 or Section 2.8.2 of the Plan to the \ncontrary, the Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to each of your Outstanding RSUs will be paid to \nyou within the calendar year that includes the date of distribution of any corresponding regular cash \ndividends paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock the record date for which occurs on or \nafter the Date of Grant.  The payment will be in an amount (less applicable withholding) equal to such \nregular dividend payment as would have been made in respect of the RSU Shares underlying such \nOutstanding RSUs.]\n(g)\nThe timing of delivery or payment referred to in Paragraph 12(b)(i) will be the earlier of \n(i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the Committee receives \nsatisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment, provided that such delivery or \npayment will be made, and any Committee action referred to in Paragraph 12(b)(ii) will be taken, only at \nsuch time as, and if and to the extent that it, as reasonably determined by the Firm, would not result in the \nimposition of any additional tax to you under Section 409A.  \n(h)\nParagraph 15 and Section 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A \nDeferred Compensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n(i)\nDelivery of RSU Shares in respect of any Award may be made, if and to the extent \nelected by the Committee, later than the Delivery Date or other date or period specified hereinabove (but, \nin the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the extent that the later \ndelivery is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(j)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes \nand penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to designate, directly or \nindirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.\nCommittee Authority, Amendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting \n19.\nCommittee Authority.  The Committee has the authority to determine, in its sole \ndiscretion, that any event triggering forfeiture or repayment of your Award will not apply, to limit the \nforfeitures and repayments that result under Paragraphs 9 and 10 and to remove any Transfer Restrictions \nbefore the applicable Transferability Date.  In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may \ndetermine whether Paragraphs 11(a)(ii) and 11(b) will apply upon a termination of Employment and \nwhether a termination of Employment constitutes an Approved Termination under Paragraph 11(c).\n20.\nAmendment.  The Committee reserves the right at any time to amend the terms of this \nAward Agreement, and the Board may amend the Plan in any respect; provided that, notwithstanding the \nforegoing and Sections 1.3.2(f), 1.3.2(h) and 3.1 of the Plan, no such amendment will materially \nadversely affect your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement without your consent; and \nprovided further that the Committee expressly reserves its rights to amend the Award Agreement and the \nPlan as described in Sections 1.3.2(h)(1), (2) and (4) of the Plan.  A modification that impacts the tax \nconsequences of this Award or the timing of delivery of RSU Shares will not be an amendment that \nmaterially adversely affects your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement.  Any amendment of \nthis Award Agreement will be in writing.\n21.\nConstruction, Headings.  Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) words describing \nthe singular number include the plural and vice versa, (b) words denoting any gender include all genders \nand (c) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words \n“without limitation.”  The headings in this Award Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and \nare not intended to define or limit the construction of the provisions hereof.  References in this Award \nAgreement to any specific Plan provision will not be construed as limiting the applicability of any other \nPlan provision.    \n- 11 -\n22.\nProviding Information to the Appropriate Authorities; Protected Communications.  \nIn accordance with applicable law, nothing in this Award Agreement (including the forfeiture and \nrepayment provisions in Paragraphs 9 and 10) or the Plan prevents you from providing information you \nreasonably believe to be true to the appropriate governmental authority, including a regulatory, judicial, \nadministrative, or other governmental entity; reporting possible violations of law or regulation; making \nother disclosures that are protected under any applicable law or regulation; or filing a charge or \nparticipating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by a governmental authority.

Similarly, nothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan prohibits you \nfrom engaging in protected concerted activity pursuant to applicable law protecting such activity, \nincluding discussing wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of your employment; or speaking with \nyour own attorney regarding your own legal rights or obligations.  In addition, nothing in this Award \nAgreement or the Plan limits your ability to use the internal and external reporting channels that are \navailable to you, as described in the Firmwide Policy on Escalation.\n- 12 -\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, GS Inc. has caused this Award Agreement to be duly \nexecuted and delivered as of the Date of Grant.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.\n- 13 -\n[EU and UK Material Risk Taker Appendix\nThis Appendix supplements Paragraph 9 and sets forth additional events that result in forfeiture of up to \nall of your RSUs and any Shares at Risk and may require repayment to the Firm of up to all other \namounts previously delivered or paid to you under your Award in accordance with Paragraph 10.

The Committee will have full authority to give \neffect to this intent.  To the extent necessary to give effect to this intent, in the case of any conflict or \npotential inconsistency between the provisions of the Plan (including Sections 1.3.2 and 2.1 thereof) and \nthis Award Agreement, the provisions of this Award Agreement will govern, and in the case of any \nconflict or potential inconsistency between this Paragraph 17 and the other provisions of this Award \nAgreement, this Paragraph 17 will govern.\n(b)\nDelivery of RSU Shares will not be delayed beyond the date on which all applicable \nconditions or restrictions on delivery of RSU Shares required by this Award Agreement (including those \nspecified in Paragraphs 6, 7, 11(c) and 12 and the consents and other items specified in Section 3.3 of the \nPlan) are satisfied.

This Award will be governed by and construed in accordance with \nthe laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.\nCertain Tax Provisions\n19.\nCompliance of Award Agreement and Plan with Section 409A.  The provisions of this \nParagraph 18 apply to you only if you are a U.S. taxpayer.\n(a)\nThis Award Agreement and the Plan provisions that apply to this Award are intended and \nwill be construed to comply with Section 409A (including the requirements applicable to, or the \nconditions for exemption from treatment as, 409A Deferred Compensation), whether by reason of short-\nterm deferral treatment or other exceptions or provisions.  The Committee will have full authority to give \neffect to this intent.  To the extent necessary to give effect to this intent, in the case of any conflict or \npotential inconsistency between the provisions of the Plan (including Sections 1.3.2 and 2.1 thereof) and \nthis Award Agreement, the provisions of this Award Agreement will govern, and in the case of any \nconflict or potential inconsistency between this Paragraph 18 and the other provisions of this Award \nAgreement, this Paragraph 18 will govern.\n(b)\nDelivery of RSU Shares will not be delayed beyond the date on which all applicable \nconditions or restrictions on delivery of RSU Shares required by this Award Agreement (including those \nspecified in Paragraphs 6, 7, 11(a)(ii), 11(b), 12(c) and 13 and the consents and other items specified in \nSection 3.3 of the Plan) are satisfied.  To the extent that any portion of this Award is intended to satisfy \nthe requirements for short-term deferral treatment under Section 409A, delivery for such portion will \noccur by the March 15 coinciding with the last day of the applicable “short-term deferral” period \ndescribed in Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4) in order for the delivery of RSU Shares to be within the short-term \ndeferral exception unless, in order to permit all applicable conditions or restrictions on delivery to be \nsatisfied, the Committee elects, pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted \nin accordance with Section 409A, to delay delivery of RSU Shares to a later date within the same \ncalendar year or to such later date as may be permitted under Section 409A, including Reg. 1.409A-3(d).  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the Award includes a “series of installment payments” as described in Reg. \n1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), your right to the series of installment payments will be treated as a right to a series of \nseparate payments and not as a right to a single payment.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 13(e) and Section 1.3.2(i) of the Plan, to the \nextent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any securities, other Awards or other property that the \nFirm may deliver in respect of your RSUs will not have the effect of deferring delivery or payment, \nincome inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the date on which such delivery, payment or \ninclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with respect to the RSU Shares that would \notherwise have been deliverable (unless the Committee elects a later date for this purpose pursuant to \nReg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted under Section 409A, including and to the \nextent applicable, the subsequent election provisions of Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. \n1.409A-2(b)).\n- 10 -\n(d)\nNotwithstanding the timing provisions of Paragraph 12(c), the delivery of RSU Shares \nreferred to therein will be made after the date of death and not later than the end of the calendar year \nfollowing the calendar year that includes the date of death (or on such later date as may be permitted \nunder Section 409A).\n(e)\nThe timing of delivery or payment pursuant to Paragraph 12(a) will occur on the earlier \nof (i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the termination of \nEmployment occurs; provided, however, that if you are a “specified employee” (as defined by the Firm in \naccordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(i)(B) of the Code), delivery will occur on the earlier of the Delivery \nDate or (to the extent required to avoid the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A) the date that \nis six months after your termination of Employment (or, if the latter date is not during a Window Period, \nthe first trading day of the next Window Period).  For purposes of Paragraph 12(a), references in this \nAward Agreement to termination of Employment mean a termination of Employment from the Firm (as \ndefined by the Firm) which is also a separation from service (as defined by the Firm in accordance with \nSection 409A).\n(f)\n[Notwithstanding any provision of Paragraph 8 or Section 2.8.2 of the Plan to the \ncontrary, the Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to each of your Outstanding RSUs will be paid to \nyou within the calendar year that includes the date of distribution of any corresponding regular cash \ndividends paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock the record date for which occurs on or \nafter the Date of Grant.  The payment will be in an amount (less applicable withholding) equal to such \nregular dividend payment as would have been made in respect of the RSU Shares underlying such \nOutstanding RSUs.]\n(g)\nThe timing of delivery or payment referred to in Paragraph 12(b)(i) will be the earlier of \n(i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the Committee receives \nsatisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment, provided that such delivery or \npayment will be made, and any Committee action referred to in Paragraph 12(b)(ii) will be taken, only at \nsuch time as, and if and to the extent that it, as reasonably determined by the Firm, would not result in the \nimposition of any additional tax to you under Section 409A.  \n(h)\nParagraph 15 and Section 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A \nDeferred Compensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n(i)\nDelivery of RSU Shares in respect of any Award may be made, if and to the extent \nelected by the Committee, later than the Delivery Date or other date or period specified hereinabove (but, \nin the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the extent that the later \ndelivery is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(j)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes \nand penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to designate, directly or \nindirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.\nCommittee Authority, Amendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting \n20.\nCommittee Authority.  The Committee has the authority to determine, in its sole \ndiscretion, that any event triggering forfeiture or repayment of your Award will not apply, to limit the \nforfeitures and repayments that result under Paragraphs 9 and 10 and to remove any Transfer Restrictions \nbefore the applicable Transferability Date.  In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may \ndetermine whether Paragraphs 11(a)(ii) and 11(b) will apply upon a termination of Employment and \nwhether a termination of Employment constitutes an Approved Termination under Paragraph 11(c).  \n21.\nAmendment.  The Committee reserves the right at any time to amend the terms of this \nAward Agreement, and the Board may amend the Plan in any respect; provided that, notwithstanding the \nforegoing and Sections 1.3.2(f), 1.3.2(h) and 3.1 of the Plan, no such amendment will materially \nadversely affect your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement without your consent; and \nprovided further that the Committee expressly reserves its rights to amend the Award Agreement and the \n- 11 -\nPlan as described in Sections 1.3.2(h)(1), (2) and (4) of the Plan.  A modification that impacts the tax \nconsequences of this Award or the timing of delivery of RSU Shares will not be an amendment that \nmaterially adversely affects your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement.  Any amendment of \nthis Award Agreement will be in writing.\n22.\nConstruction, Headings.  Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) words describing \nthe singular number include the plural and vice versa, (b) words denoting any gender include all genders \nand (c) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words \n“without limitation.”  The headings in this Award Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and \nare not intended to define or limit the construction of the provisions hereof.  References in this Award \nAgreement to any specific Plan provision will not be construed as limiting the applicability of any other \nPlan provision.\n23.\nProviding Information to the Appropriate Authorities; Protected Communications.  \nIn accordance with applicable law, nothing in this Award Agreement (including the forfeiture and \nrepayment provisions in Paragraphs 9 and 10) or the Plan prevents you from providing information you \nreasonably believe to be true to the appropriate governmental authority, including a regulatory, judicial, \nadministrative, or other governmental entity; reporting possible violations of law or regulation; making \nother disclosures that are protected under any applicable law or regulation; or filing a charge or \nparticipating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by a governmental authority.  For the \navoidance of doubt, governmental authority includes Federal, state and local government agencies such as \nthe SEC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and any state or local human rights agency \n(e.g., the New York State Division of Human Rights, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, \nthe California Civil Rights Department), as well as law enforcement (e.g., the state Attorney General and \nthe U.S. Department of Justice).  Similarly, nothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan prohibits you \nfrom engaging in protected concerted activity pursuant to applicable law protecting such activity, \nincluding discussing wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of your employment; or speaking with \nyour own attorney regarding your own legal rights or obligations.  In addition, nothing in this Award \nAgreement or the Plan limits your ability to use the internal and external reporting channels that are \navailable to you, as described in the Firmwide Policy on Escalation.\n- 12 -\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, GS Inc. has caused this Award Agreement to be duly \nexecuted and delivered as of the Date of Grant.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.\n- 13 -\n[EU and UK Material Risk Taker Appendix\nThis Appendix supplements Paragraph 9 and sets forth additional events that result in forfeiture of up to \nall of your RSUs and any Shares at Risk and may require repayment to the Firm of up to all other \namounts previously delivered or paid to you under your Award in accordance with Paragraph 10.  As with \nthe events described in Paragraph 9, more than one event may apply; in no case will the occurrence of one \nevent limit the forfeiture and repayment obligations as a result of the occurrence of any other event; and \nthe Firm reserves the same rights in connection with any investigation of whether any of the events that \nresult in forfeiture under this Appendix have occurred as set forth in Paragraph 9(e). \nWith respect to the events described in this Appendix, the Committee will consider certain factors to \ndetermine whether and what portion of your Award will terminate, including the reason for the Loss \nEvent or Risk Event, as well as the extent to which you participated in the Loss Event or Risk Event and \nyour compensation for the ____ may or may not have been adjusted to take into account the risk \nassociated with the Loss Event, Risk Event, your Serious Misconduct or the Serious Misconduct of a \nSupervised Employee.  Your compensation may be adjusted for the year in which the Loss Event, Risk \nEvent, your Serious Misconduct or a Supervised Employee’s Serious Misconduct is discovered.\nIf you are an EU MRT, Paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) apply to all RSUs in your Award.  If you are a \nGSAMI MRT, GSAMI Senior Management or UK MRT, Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Appendix \napply to all RSUs in your Award, but Paragraph (d) applies only to your Base RSUs [and Additional \nRSUs, as applicable], but not any Supplemental RSUs.  Paragraph (e) of this Appendix contains certain \ndefinitions not otherwise contained in the Award Agreement.\n(a)\nA Loss Event Occurs Prior to Delivery.  If a Loss Event occurs prior to the delivery of \nRSU Shares, your rights in respect of all or a portion of your RSUs (whether or not Vested) which are \nscheduled to deliver on the next Delivery Date immediately following the date that the Loss Event is \nidentified (or, if not practicable, then the next following Delivery Date) will terminate, and no RSU \nShares will be delivered in respect of such RSUs.  \n(i)\n“Loss Event” means (A) an annual pre-tax loss at GS Inc. or (B) annual negative \nrevenues in one or more reporting segments as disclosed in the Firm’s Form 10-K other than the \nAsset & Wealth Management segment (or any successor or equivalent segment or sub-segment as \ndetermined by the Firm), or annual negative revenues in the Asset & Wealth Management \nsegment (or any successor or equivalent segment or sub-segment as determined by the Firm) of \n$5 billion or more, provided in either case that you are employed in a business within such \nreporting segment.\n(b)\nA Risk Event Occurs On or Before the Applicable End Date.

The payment will be in an amount (less applicable withholding) equal to \nsuch regular dividend payment as would have been made in respect of the RSU Shares underlying such \nOutstanding Short-Term RSUs.\n(g)\nThe timing of delivery or payment referred to in Paragraph 10(b)(i) will be the earlier of \n(i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the Committee receives \nsatisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment, provided that such delivery or \npayment will be made, and any Committee action referred to in Paragraph 10(b)(ii) will be taken, only at \nsuch time as, and if and to the extent that it, as reasonably determined by the Firm, would not result in the \nimposition of any additional tax to you under Section 409A.  \n(h)\nParagraph 13 and Section 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A \nDeferred Compensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n(i)\nDelivery of RSU Shares in respect of any Award may be made, if and to the extent \nelected by the Committee, later than the Delivery Date or other date or period specified hereinabove (but, \n- 8 -\nin the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the extent that the later \ndelivery is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(j)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes \nand penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to designate, directly or \nindirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.\nCommittee Authority, Amendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting\n17.\nCommittee Authority.

The Committee will have full authority to give \neffect to this intent.  To the extent necessary to give effect to this intent, in the case of any conflict or \npotential inconsistency between the provisions of the Plan (including Sections 1.3.2 and 2.1 thereof) and \nthis Award Agreement, the provisions of this Award Agreement will govern, and in the case of any \nconflict or potential inconsistency between this Paragraph 18 and the other provisions of this Award \nAgreement, this Paragraph 18 will govern.\n(b)\nSettlement will not be delayed beyond the date on which all applicable conditions or \nrestrictions on settlement in respect of your PSUs required by this Award Agreement (including the \nconsents and other items specified in Section 3.3 of the Plan) are satisfied.  To the extent that any portion \nof this Award is intended to satisfy the requirements for short-term deferral treatment under Section \n409A, settlement in respect of such portion will occur by the March 15 coinciding with the last day of the \napplicable “short-term deferral” period described in Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4) in order for settlement to be \nwithin the short-term deferral exception unless, in order to permit all applicable conditions or restrictions \non settlement to be satisfied, the Committee elects, pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as \nmay be permitted in accordance with Section 409A, to delay settlement to a later date within the same \ncalendar year or to such later date as may be permitted under Section 409A, including Reg. 1.409A-3(d).  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the Award includes a “series of installment payments” as described in Reg. \n1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), your right to the series of installment payments will be treated as a right to a series of \nseparate payments and not as a right to a single payment.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 13(e) and Section 1.3.2(i) of the Plan, to the \nextent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any delivery or payment [(including in the form of Shares \nat Risk or other property)] that the Firm may make in respect of your PSUs will not have the effect of \ndeferring delivery or payment, income inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the date on \nwhich such delivery, payment or inclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with \nrespect to the payment or delivery that would otherwise have been made (unless the Committee elects a \nlater date for this purpose pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted under \nSection 409A, including and to the extent applicable, the subsequent election provisions of Section \n409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. 1.409A-2(b)).\n(d)\nParagraph 15 and Section 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A \nDeferred Compensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n(e)\nSettlement in respect of any portion of the Award may be made, if and to the extent \nelected by the Committee, later than the [applicable] Settlement Date or other date or period specified \nhereinabove (but, in the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the \nextent that the later payment or delivery, as applicable, is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(f)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes \nand penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to designate, directly or \nindirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.\nCommittee Authority, Amendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting\n19.\nCommittee Authority.  The Committee has the authority to determine, in its sole \ndiscretion, that any event triggering forfeiture or repayment of your Award will not apply, to limit the \nforfeitures and repayments that result under Paragraphs 9 and 10 and to remove any Transfer Restrictions \nbefore the [applicable] Transferability Date.  \n20.\nAmendment.  The Committee reserves the right at any time to amend the terms of this \nAward Agreement, and the Board may amend the Plan in any respect; provided that, notwithstanding the \nforegoing and Sections 1.3.2(f), 1.3.2(h) and 3.1 of the Plan, no such amendment will materially \nadversely affect your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement without your consent; and \nprovided further that the Committee expressly reserves its rights to amend the Award Agreement and the \n- 10 -\nPlan as described in Sections 1.3.2(h)(1), (2) and (4) of the Plan.  A modification that impacts the tax \nconsequences of this Award or the timing of delivery of the Settlement Amount will not be an amendment \nthat materially adversely affects your rights and obligations under this Award Agreement.  Any \namendment of this Award Agreement will be in writing.\n21.\nConstruction, Headings.  Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) words describing \nthe singular number include the plural and vice versa, (b) words denoting any gender include all genders \nand (c) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words \n“without limitation.”  The headings in this Award Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and \nare not intended to define or limit the construction of the provisions hereof.  References in this Award \nAgreement to any specific Plan provision will not be construed as limiting the applicability of any other \nPlan provision.\n22.\nProviding Information to the Appropriate Authorities; Protected Communications.  \nIn accordance with applicable law, nothing in this Award Agreement (including the forfeiture and \nrepayment provisions in Paragraphs 9 and 10) or the Plan prevents you from providing information you \nreasonably believe to be true to the appropriate governmental authority, including a regulatory, judicial, \nadministrative, or other governmental entity; reporting possible violations of law or regulation; making \nother disclosures that are protected under any applicable law or regulation; or filing a charge or \nparticipating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by a governmental authority.

Similarly, nothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan prohibits you \nfrom engaging in protected concerted activity pursuant to applicable law protecting such activity, \nincluding discussing wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of your employment; or speaking with \nyour own attorney regarding your own legal rights or obligations.  In addition, nothing in this Award \nAgreement or the Plan limits your ability to use the internal and external reporting channels that are \navailable to you, as described in the Firmwide Policy on Escalation. \n- 11 -\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, GS Inc. has caused this Award Agreement to be duly \nexecuted and delivered as of the Date of Grant.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.\n- 12 -\n[EU and UK Material Risk Taker Appendix\nQualitative Overlay Reduction\n(g)\nIn addition to and without limiting the Firm’s rights under the forfeiture and repayment \nprovisions set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 or in the “Forfeiture and Repayment” section below, the \nCommittee may determine to reduce the Settlement Amount as described in the section entitled \n“Qualitative Overlay Reduction” in the Award Statement.  \nForfeiture and Repayment\nThis Appendix supplements Paragraph 9 and sets forth additional events that result in forfeiture of up to \nall of your PSUs and any Shares at Risk and may require repayment to the Firm of up to all other amounts \npreviously delivered or paid to you under your Award in accordance with Paragraph 10.

The Committee will have full authority to give \neffect to this intent.  To the extent necessary to give effect to this intent, in the case of any conflict or \npotential inconsistency between the provisions of the Plan (including Sections 1.3.2 and 2.1 thereof) and \nthis Award Agreement, the provisions of this Award Agreement will govern, and in the case of any \n- 10 -\nconflict or potential inconsistency between this Paragraph 18 and the other provisions of this Award \nAgreement, this Paragraph 18 will govern.\n(b)\nSettlement will not be delayed beyond the date on which all applicable conditions or \nrestrictions on settlement in respect of your PSUs required by this Award Agreement (including [those \nspecified in Paragraph 11 (execution of waiver and release of claims agreement to pay associated tax \nliability) and] the consents and other items specified in Section 3.3 of the Plan) are satisfied.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Award \nincludes a “series of installment payments” as described in Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), your right to the \nseries of installment payments will be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right \nto a single payment.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 13(e) and Section 1.3.2(i) of the Plan, to the \nextent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any delivery or payment [(including in the form of Shares \nat Risk or other property)] that the Firm may make in respect of your PSUs will not have the effect of \ndeferring delivery or payment, income inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the date on \nwhich such delivery, payment or inclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with \nrespect to the payment or delivery that would otherwise have been made (unless the Committee elects a \nlater date for this purpose pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted under \nSection 409A, including and to the extent applicable, the subsequent election provisions of Section \n409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. 1.409A-2(b)).\n(d)\nParagraph 15 and Section 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A \nDeferred Compensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A.\n(e)\nSettlement in respect of any portion of the Award may be made, if and to the extent \nelected by the Committee, later than the [applicable] Settlement Date or other date or period specified \nhereinabove (but, in the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the \nextent that the later payment or delivery, as applicable, is permitted under Section 409A).  \n(f)\nYou understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes \nand penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to designate, directly or \nindirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.\nCommittee Authority, Amendment, Construction and Regulatory Reporting\n19.\nCommittee Authority.  The Committee has the authority to determine, in its sole \ndiscretion, that any event triggering forfeiture or repayment of your Award will not apply, to limit the \nforfeitures and repayments that result under Paragraphs 9 and 10 and to remove any Transfer Restrictions \nbefore the [applicable] Transferability Date.  [In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may \ndetermine whether Paragraph 11(b)[ or (c)] will apply upon a termination of Employment.]\n20.\nAmendment.

The name of the Fund shall be [   ] or such other name as the General Partner may from \ntime to time designate.

The principal place of business of the Fund shall be at [   ], and/or at such other \nplace within or outside [   ] as the General Partner may hereafter designate in writing to the Limited Partners from \ntime to time.\n1\n1.3.\nRegistered Office.  The initial address of the Fund’s registered office is [   ].\n1.4.\nPurpose\n.\n(a)\nThe purposes of the Fund are to engage in any lawful act or activity for which limited \npartnerships may be formed under the Delaware Act, including investing all or substantially all of its committed \ncapital in a diversified set of equity-oriented funds sponsored by Goldman Sachs Asset & Wealth Management, as is \nmore fully described in the Offering Memorandum (any such investment of any type held, directly or indirectly, by \nthe Fund, any wholly or partly owned subsidiary (a “Subsidiary”), any Investment Vehicle or Alternative Investment \nVehicle from time to time, a “Fund Investment”), and engaging in any other activities which may be directly or \nindirectly related or incidental to any of the foregoing.  In particular, the Fund expects to invest in: [   ] (collectively, \nthe “Underlying Funds” and each, separately, an a “Underlying Fund”).  In the sole discretion of the General \nPartner, the Fund may determine not to invest in one or more of the Underlying Funds, or may invest in other \nunderlying funds.  The Underlying Funds are expected to invest alongside funds formed for clients of Goldman \nSachs (the “External Funds”).\n(b)\nThe Fund, together with one or more of [   ], the “Funds”), may not invest in an \nUnderlying Fund (or its offshore analogue), or will invest in an Underlying Fund using different structures.  The \nUnderlying Funds may make their investments through one or more U.S. or non-U.S. investment or finance vehicles \norganized by or for the applicable Underlying Fund, that may be wholly owned by such Underlying Fund or owned \nby the applicable Underlying Fund together with any wholly or partially owned Subsidiary, Alternative Investment \nVehicles, other investment funds or vehicles managed by Goldman Sachs (the “Other Funds”), and/or other \ninvestors (each, together with their respective permitted assignees or designees, an “Investment Vehicle”).\n(c)\nIt is understood by all the parties hereto that the interests of the clients of Goldman Sachs \nand the legal and ethical obligations of Goldman Sachs to its clients are paramount and prior to the interests of the \nFund or any Partners thereof.  Consequently, the Fund shall not make any investment which Goldman Sachs \ndetermines to be inappropriate in light of such obligations.  The Fund shall promptly dispose of any investment \nwhich Goldman Sachs deems to be inappropriate in light of such obligations.  The Fund shall not enter into any \ntransaction with any Person, nor accept any investment opportunity from any Person, if deemed by Goldman Sachs \nto be inappropriate in light of such obligations.\n1.5.\nStatus for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes.  The Fund and, if established, each Series intends, \nand shall take all appropriate steps, to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in the \ndiscretion of the General Partner, for purposes of the tax laws of any other relevant jurisdiction for which such \ntreatment is available.\n1.6.\nPowers and Authority.  The Fund and each Series shall possess and may exercise all powers, \nauthority and privileges granted by the Delaware Act, any other law or this Agreement, including the power and \nauthority to perform any act or carry out any activity or transaction contemplated by or in furtherance of this \nAgreement or as is in the General Partner’s determination necessary, appropriate, desirable, incidental or convenient \nto or for the furtherance or accomplishment of the foregoing objectives and purposes.\n1.7.\nTerm.  Subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, the Fund will dissolve and terminate one (1) year \nafter the date by which all of the Fund’s investments have been liquidated and the Fund’s obligations (including, \nwithout limitation, contingent obligations) have been terminated (or reasonable provision has been otherwise made \nfor such obligations), provided that the General Partner may amend this Agreement without the consent of the \nLimited Partners:  (a) in accordance with Section 11.2(d)(vii), to set the date on which the Fund shall dissolve and \nterminate on any date not later than the fifteenth anniversary of the formation of the Fund and (b) to limit the \nduration of the Fund’s investments in any Fund Assets to a period of 15 years to satisfy certain requirements under \nthe U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), subject in all cases to the General \nPartner’s right, pursuant to Section 9.1, to liquidate the Fund at any time. \n1.8.\nContinuance/Qualification.  In the event that it shall be necessary for the Fund to exist or qualify \nto do business under the laws of any jurisdiction other than or in addition to the State of Delaware, the parties hereby \n2\nagree that the Fund shall take such action as may be necessary to exist or qualify to do business in any state in which \nsuch existence or qualification shall be required; provided, that, in any such event the Fund shall at all times \ncontinue to be a limited partnership formed under and governed by the provisions of the Delaware Act.\n1.9.\nEstablishment of Series.\n(a)\nEach Limited Partner understands and acknowledges that this Agreement grants the \nGeneral Partner the right to establish one or more separate Series of partners or partnership interests pursuant to \nSection 17-218 of the Delaware Act, with such terms as may be determined by the General Partner in its sole \ndiscretion.  Each Limited Partner understands and acknowledges that such Limited Partner may not hold an interest \nin each Series.  In addition, each Limited Partner understands and acknowledges that, except as expressly provided \nin this Agreement, such Limited Partner has no right to participate, and the General Partner has no duty or obligation \nto offer to such Limited Partner the right to participate, in any Series.\n(b)\nThe terms of each Series shall be as set forth in this Agreement, and any supplement to \nthis Agreement relating to a particular Series (each, a “Series Supplement”).  For all purposes of the Delaware Act, \nthis Agreement together with each Series Supplement, if any, constitute the “partnership agreement” of the Fund \nwithin the meaning of the Delaware Act.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the \nterms and provisions of a Series Supplement may have the effect of altering, supplementing or amending the terms \nand provisions of this Agreement, and to the extent that any of the terms or provisions of a Series Supplement \nconflict with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, the terms or provisions of such Series Supplement \nshall control with respect to such Series.  As established from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, a \nSeries may be designated as having separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified assets, property, \nobligations or liabilities or profits and losses associated with specified assets, property, obligations or liabilities and, \nto the extent provided in this Agreement or the Series Supplement that corresponds to such Series, as having a \nseparate business purpose or investment objective than the Fund or any other Series.  A Person may be admitted as a \nlimited partner of the Fund associated with more than one Series.  The General Partner shall be the sole general \npartner of the Fund associated with each Series.\n(c)\nAll capital contributions, assets, income, fees, earnings, profits and proceeds held or \nreceived by the Fund in respect of a Series shall be deemed to be and may be referred to herein as “assets belonging \nto” that Series (and to no other Series) for all purposes hereof.\n(d)\nThe assets belonging to a particular Series shall be so recorded upon the books of the \nFund, and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Limited Partners of such Series.  The assets belonging to each \nparticular Series shall be charged with the liabilities of that Series, and with all expenses, costs, charges and reserves \nattributable to that Series.  The debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise \nexisting with respect to a particular Series shall be enforceable against the assets belonging to such Series only, and \nnot against the assets of the Fund generally or of any other Series.  No Limited Partner or former Limited Partner of \nany Series shall have any claim on or right to any assets allocated or belonging to any other Series.\n(e)\nSeparate and distinct records shall be maintained by the Fund for each Series and the \nassets associated with or belonging to any such Series shall be held and accounted for separately from the assets of \nthe Fund or of any other Series.  To the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware Act, the Limited Partners of a \nSeries shall only have access to the records of such Series, including the Series Supplement that corresponds to such \nSeries.\n(f)\n“Series” shall mean any separate series of partners or partnership interests established by \nthe General Partner pursuant to Section 17-218 of the Delaware Act and this Section 1.9.  References in this \nAgreement to the “Fund” shall, to the extent the context requires, be deemed to be references to one or more Series.\n3\nArticle II\nThe General Partner;\nRelationship with Goldman Sachs\n2.1.\nThe General Partner.  The name, registered office, business address and capital commitment of the \nGeneral Partner are set forth on Exhibit A hereto, as amended from time to time, and are incorporated herein by \nreference.  The General Partner shall acquire a Class O Interest as a Partner in exchange for its capital commitment.  \nGoldman Sachs is authorized to admit any Person to the Fund as a general partner, to cause the withdrawal of any \ngeneral partner of the Fund and to effect the transfer of a general partner interest from any general partner to any \nsuccessor general partner, subject to the restrictions set forth herein.  All references in this Agreement to the General \nPartner shall be deemed to include [   ] and any successor general partner.\n2.2.\nManagement.  The General Partner shall have the exclusive right to manage, conduct and control \nthe affairs of the Fund.  To the extent permitted by the General Partner’s organizational documents, the General \nPartner is authorized at any time to designate one or more managers or successor managers, to remove any manager \nor successor manager and to designate a replacement manager or managers.\n2.3.\nDelegation of Managerial Authority.  It is understood that the General Partner may delegate any or \nall of its duties, rights and responsibilities in respect of the Fund (other than investment decisions) to its managers, \nofficers, affiliates and/or to third parties selected by the General Partner.  In addition, subject to guidelines in \nkeeping with the investment objectives and policies of the Fund as set forth in the confidential offering \nmemorandum relating to the Fund, dated [   ] (as supplemented from time to time, the “Offering Memorandum”), the \nGeneral Partner may delegate final investment decisions to committees of one or more officers, directors or \nemployees of Goldman Sachs.  The General Partner initially delegates managerial authority to [   ] (the “Investment \nManager”), and shall, on behalf of and in the name of the Fund, enter into an investment management agreement \nwith the Investment Manager, all without the further approval of any Limited Partner.  It is understood that the \nInvestment Manager may delegate its managerial authority to other or additional officers, directors or employees of \nGoldman Sachs.  In addition, the General Partner hereby admits [   ] as a Limited Partner in the Fund to serve as the \n“qualified institutional investor” in respect of the Fund for purposes of non-U.S. securities laws.  The Limited \nPartners acknowledge and agree that, so long as such delegation remains in effect, (i) the General Partner shall have \nno responsibility for making any investment, disposition or management decisions on behalf of the Fund, and (ii) the \nInvestment Manager shall have sole authority to make such investment, disposition and management decisions, \nincluding the authority to approve all investments in Underlying Funds.\n2.4.\nNo Compensation of Members and Officers.  Neither the members of any investment committee \nthat evaluates potential investments in Underlying Funds nor the officers of the General Partner shall be entitled to \nreceive any compensation from the Fund for their services.\n2.5.\nReliance by Third Parties.  Persons dealing with the Fund are entitled to rely conclusively upon a \ncertificate of the General Partner to the effect that it is then acting as the General Partner and upon the power and \nauthority of the General Partner and of any Person to whom the General Partner may have delegated all or part of \nsuch power and authority as herein set forth.\n2.6.\nServices by Goldman Sachs; Expenses.\n(a)\nThe Fund (and each of the Other Funds) shall be responsible for its pro rata share (based \non its aggregate capital commitments as a proportion of the aggregate capital commitments to the Fund and \nthe Other Funds) of all the expenses and fees incurred in connection with (1) the organization of, and the \noffering of limited partnership interests in the Fund and the Other Funds and (2) any Fund Expenses \nincurred by the Fund; provided that, in circumstances where the General Partner reasonably believes that \nsuch expenses and fees allocated to the Fund and/or the Other Funds pursuant to the foregoing procedures \nwould produce an inequitable result, or are directly attributable or allocable to the Fund and/or an Other \nFund, the General Partner may allocate such expenses and fees to the Fund or such Other Fund, as it \ndetermines in its sole discretion, in a fair and equitable manner, which may not be on a pro rata basis.  All \nFund Expenses shall be paid out of capital contributions, borrowings or proceeds or other cash funds of the \nFund that are determined by the General Partner to be available for such purpose; provided that the General \nPartner and/or the Investment Manager may advance funds or arrange for one of its affiliates to advance \nfunds to the Fund for the payment of Fund Expenses and the General Partner or such affiliate shall be \nentitled to the reimbursement, without interest, of any funds so advanced.  As used herein, “Fund \n4\nExpenses” shall include, whether incurred directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the Fund, including by \nthe Investment Manager, or any Investment Vehicle, but not be limited to, the following (to the extent not \nreimbursed by the Portfolio Companies or any other Person):1\n(i)\nall costs and expenses2 necessary to register or qualify the Fund, and, if \nestablished, any Series, under any applicable laws, rule or directive or any other regulatory \nrequirement, including U.S. federal or state or foreign laws, to maintain such registrations or \nqualifications or to obtain or maintain exemptions under such laws, or compliance with the \nforegoing requirements by Goldman Sachs or its affiliates to the extent such compliance relates to \nthe Fund’s activities;\n(ii)\nall costs and expenses charged to the Fund, including all fees or expenses that \nthe General Partner determines to be related to the acquisition or potential acquisition, holding or \ndisposing of investments and potential investments in the Underlying Funds as well as any other \ntaxes, governmental charges and other costs and expenses associated with Fund Investments and \nobtaining leverage;\n(iii)\nadministration of the Fund, including (x) all external legal, tax and accounting \ncosts and expenses, including costs and expenses for preparation of annual audited financial \nstatements, tax return preparation (or preparation of other tax filings or elections), routine tax and \nlegal advice, other tax-related expenses, including any expenses incurred by the Partnership \nRepresentative, external insurance premiums charged to the Fund (which insurance premiums may \ncover numerous Goldman Sachs advisory accounts, in which case the Goldman Sachs advisory \naccounts shall be allocated a share of such premiums), wire transfer fees, mailing costs, \namendments to this Agreement and any costs and expenses related to winding-up, dissolution, \nliquidation or termination of the Fund and (y) fees and expenses charged to the Fund in connection \nwith services performed by internal staff of Goldman Sachs and/or entities affiliated with \nGoldman Sachs for internal accounting services in an amount equal to $[   ] per each Fund per \nquarter;\n(iv)\nall costs and expenses incurred in relation to the registration of any Fund \nInvestments in the name of the Fund or its nominee or the custody of the documents of title thereto \n(including bank charges, insurance of documents of title against loss in shipment, transit or \notherwise and charges made by agents of the Fund for retaining documents in safe custody);\n(v)\nindemnification and contribution obligations of the Fund, including legal advice \nand other external costs and expenses with respect to any existing or potential claim, dispute or \nlitigation and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith; and\n(vi)\nany other costs and expenses, as reasonably determined by the Investment \nManager in good faith, that may be authorized by this Agreement or as may be necessary or \nappropriate in managing the Fund’s business.\n(b)\n[           ]  In addition, the Limited Partners will indirectly bear a proportionate share of \nthe organizational and operating fees and expenses of the Underlying Funds.  Where appropriate, the \nGeneral Partner may specifically allocate a portion of Fund Expenses to one or more particular Limited \nPartners.\n5\n1 In all relevant cases, including any travel and entertainment expenses, including private air travel when deemed appropriate by \nthe General Partner in its reasonable discretion (after taking into account the risks associated with public health crises such as \nthe COVID-19 pandemic).  \n2 In all relevant cases, costs shall include fees for purpose of the definition of “Fund Expenses.”\n(c)\nIt is understood that stock brokerage and investment advisory services for the Fund \ngenerally will be performed, and other administrative and similar services for the Fund may be performed, \nby Goldman Sachs.

[           ]  \n5.3.\nFund Investment Holding Entities.\n(a)\nThe Fund may invest directly or indirectly in one or more corporations or other \nappropriate entities that will elect to be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each, a “Fund \nInvestment Holding Corporation”), for the purpose of holding the pro rata share of any Indirect Partner of any Fund \nInvestment and/or its entitlement to Carried Interest with respect to any Fund Investment (any such capital interest \nand/or entitlement to Carried Interest, as applicable, a “Fund Asset” ).\n(b)\nThe General Partner may, but shall not be required to, cause one or more Partner’s pro \nrata share of any Fund Asset to be held, directly or indirectly, through a Fund Investment Holding Corporation, and \nin any such case, the General Partner shall provide for the acquisition by, or transfer to, such Fund Investment \nHolding Corporation of a portion of such Fund Asset corresponding to the aggregate percentage of all such Partners \n(the “Indirect Partners”).  Partners that are not Indirect Partners shall be defined, for the purposes of this Section 5.3, \nas “Direct Partners.”  For the avoidance of doubt, the determination by the General Partner of which Partners \n(including some or all of the Limited Partners) shall be Indirect Partners with respect to applying any Fund Asset, \nand which Partners shall be Direct Partners with respect to such Fund Asset, shall be made in the General Partner’s \ndiscretion.\n(c)\nAny Fund Asset in which some but less than all of the Fund’s interest is held by a Fund \nInvestment Holding Corporation shall be treated, for the purposes of this Section 5.3, as two “Special Fund \nInvestments.”  One Special Fund Investment shall be that portion of the Fund Asset that is the direct or indirect \ninvestment in the equity and/or debt instruments, if any, of such Fund Investment Holding Corporation (the \n“Corporate Portion”), and the other Special Fund Investment shall be the remaining portion of the direct or indirect \ninvestment in such Fund Asset (the “Remaining Portion”).  The Indirect Partners shall be treated as participating in \nthe Special Fund Investment (“Participating Partners”) only with respect to the Special Fund Investment that is the \nCorporate Portion, and the Direct Partners shall be treated as Participating Partners only with respect to the Special \nFund Investment that is the Remaining Portion.\n(d)\nThe (i) allocation of income, gain, loss and expense, (ii) the distribution of material net \nproceeds from the sale, refinancing, redemption or other disposition of all, or any portion, of an investment and \namounts received as extraordinary dividends or distributions in recapitalizations with regard to a Fund Asset (“Net \nProceeds from Investment Dispositions”) and (iii) distributions in respect of interest and other dividends (“Current \nCash Flow”) received by the Fund from Fund Assets in respect of the Special Fund Investment shall be made \nseparately in respect of the Corporate Portion and the Remaining Portion in accordance with the provisions of this \nSection 5.3.  An amount equal to the corporate-level tax paid or accrued by the Fund Investment Holding \nCorporation, and any expenses incurred by the Fund Investment Holding Corporation, will be deemed to have been \nallocated and distributed to the Participating Partners in such Fund Investment Holding Corporation for purposes of \ndetermining allocations and distributions under this Section 5.3.\n(e)\nDistributions made to the Indirect Partners in respect of the Special Fund Investment that \nis the Corporate Portion shall be made solely out of amounts received by the Fund in respect of dividends, \n13\ndistributions, interest or principal paid by, and redemptions or retirements with respect to the equity or debt \ninstruments of, the Fund Investment Holding Corporation.\n(f)\nThe Fund Investment Holding Corporation may enter into an agreement with the General \nPartner or an affiliate of Goldman Sachs providing for the management of such Fund Investment Holding \nCorporation.\n(g)\nThe Fund may invest directly or indirectly in one or more partnerships, limited liability \ncompanies or other appropriate entities that will elect to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes (each, a “Fund Investment Holding Partnership”), for the purpose of holding all or any portion of any Fund \nAsset, including the portion attributable to a Fund Investment Holding Corporation.  The General Partner may, in its \ndiscretion cause the Remaining Portion of any Fund Asset (as described in Section 5.3(c)) to be owned by the Fund \nInvestment Holding Partnership, in which case the partnership interests of the Fund Investment Holding Partnership \n(other than those held by the Fund Investment Holding Corporation) will be considered to be a Special Fund \nInvestment in which some or all of [           ] the Direct Partners will be the Participating Partners, as determined by \nthe General Partner.\n(h)\nThe General Partner may form or cause the Fund to form, or cause the Fund to join with \none or more of the Other Funds in forming, in each case, directly or indirectly, one or more corporations, \npartnerships, limited liability companies, or other appropriate entities to make or hold Fund Investments (each, an \n“Other Vehicle”).\n(i)\nIn any case where a Fund Asset is made through an Other Vehicle, the Other Vehicle will \nbe directly or indirectly owned by the Fund for the benefit of all of the Partners; provided, however, that in any case \nin which the General Partner determines it would be advantageous from a legal, tax, regulatory or other perspective, \nthe Other Vehicle may be utilized on behalf of less than all of the Partners (which may include or exclude [           ] \nsome or all of the Class O Limited Partners) and the investment in such Fund Investment on behalf of the remaining \nPartners (which may include or exclude [           ] some or all of the Class O Limited Partners) may be made directly \nby the Fund, or through an Other Vehicle, in which case, each such portion shall be treated, for purposes of this \nSection 5.3, as a Special Fund Investment made for the benefit of the Partners participating therein, respectively, and \nshall be attributed as the General Partner shall deem appropriate, in its sole discretion.  In any case where the Fund \nreceives or is allocated disproportionate distributions and allocations from an Other Vehicle, such disproportionate \ndistributions or allocations shall be distributed and allocated to the [           ] relevant Class O Limited Partners (or to \nthe Fund for the benefit of the [           ] relevant Class O Limited Partners) as appropriate.   \n(j)\nSubject to paragraphs (a) – (i) of this Section 5.3, the allocation of income, gain, loss and \nexpense, and the distribution of Net Proceeds from Investment Dispositions and Current Cash Flow from Fund \nAssets, in respect of a Special Fund Investment shall be made in accordance with this Article V as if such Special \nFund Investment were a Fund Asset; provided, that any allocations and distributions in respect of a Special Fund \nInvestment shall be made solely to the Participating Partners [           ]; and provided further, that in applying those \nSections, each such Participating Partner’s Special Percentage shall be substituted for such Partner’s [           ] Class \nO Percentage, as applicable. \n(k)\nThe term “Special Percentage” shall mean, with respect to each Participating Partner in \nany Special Fund Investment, the result, expressed as a percentage, of dividing such Participating Partner’s \ncontributions with respect to such Special Fund Investment by the sum of the contributions of all the Participating \nPartners with respect to such Special Fund Investment (adjusted as necessary, in the reasonable discretion of the \nGeneral Partner, to reflect (i) any funded contributions which are funded disproportionately to relative capital \ncommitments and/or (ii) the appropriate economic terms with respect to Class O Limited Partners).\n5.4.\nProhibited Transactions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and except to \nthe extent permitted under the terms and conditions of the Application or any order approving the Application, and \nexcept for any joint trading account through which the Fund and affiliates of the General Partner may engage in the \ntransactions contemplated by Section 5.1, no funds of the Fund shall be kept in any account other than a Fund \n14\naccount, and funds shall not be commingled with the funds of any other Person, and the General Partner shall not \nemploy, or permit any other Person to employ, such funds in any manner except for the benefit of the Fund (it being \nunderstood that this provision does not prohibit any investments otherwise permitted to be made by the Fund and \ndoes not apply to funds owned by Portfolio Companies).\n5.5.\nRestrictions on the Authority of the General Partner.\n(a)\nThe General Partner shall not have the authority to:\n(i)\ndo any act in contravention of this Agreement or the Delaware Act or any other \napplicable law;\n(ii)\ndo any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the \nFund, which, for the avoidance of doubt shall not prohibit the General Partner from selling any or all of the \nassets of the Fund at any time;\n(iii)\npossess Fund property or assign, pledge, grant a security interest in or over, \ncharge or hypothecate its rights in specific Fund property, for other than a Fund purpose;\n(iv)\nexcept as provided in Section 8.10, admit another Person as a general partner, \nunless such Person is an entity wholly owned by Goldman Sachs; or\n(v)\nadmit a Person as a Limited Partner or SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner, \nexcept as provided in this Agreement and in the Offering Memorandum or as otherwise permitted by the \nterms and conditions of the Application or any order approving the Application.\n(b)\nThe General Partner shall not perform any act that would subject any Limited Partner or \nSOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner to liability as a general partner in any jurisdiction.\n5.6.\nIndemnification and Contribution.\n(a)\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the General Partner, the Investment \nManager, Goldman Sachs, the Partnership Representative, the Fund persons controlling, controlled by or under \ncommon control with any of the foregoing or any of their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, \nmanaging directors, stockholders, members, other equity holders, employees and controlling Persons (if any) (each, \na “Management Indemnified Person” and collectively, the “Management Indemnified Persons”), shall be liable to \nthe Fund or to any Limited Partners or SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partners for:  (i) any act or omission \nperformed or omitted by any such Management Indemnified Person (or by another Management Indemnified \nPerson) or for any Losses arising therefrom, in the absence of gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or any \nmaterial violation of any applicable securities law or any other intentional or criminal wrongdoing on the part of \nsuch Management Indemnified Person or any willful and material breach by such Management Indemnified Person \nof this Agreement or any side letter that is reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the Fund;

(ii) any tax liability \n(including any liability for withholding, transfer, or other taxes (including (x) any interest and penalties thereon, (y) \nwithholding tax liabilities pursuant to Section 1446(f) of the Code, and (z) any “imputed underpayment” attributable \nto any such Limited Partner, as determined by the Partnership Representative in its sole discretion, under Section \n6225 of the Code)) imposed on the Fund, any Subsidiary of the Fund or other entity in which the Fund invests, \ndirectly or indirectly, or any Limited Partner or SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner (in excess of such \nManagement Indemnified Person’s proportionate share of any such tax liability as a Partner); or (iii) any act or \nomission performed by or omitted by brokers or other agents of the Fund or their respective employees (unless such \nemployee, broker or agent is a Management Indemnified Person, in which case clause (i) of this sentence would \napply, as applicable) so long as such Persons were selected with reasonable care.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the \nFund will not indemnify any Management Indemnified Person for Losses incurred in connection with proceedings \nwhere one or more Management Indemnified Persons are suing one or more other Management Indemnified Persons \nunless one of the Funds is a plaintiff, defendant or other participant in such proceedings or will (or could reasonably \nbe expected to) receive any monetary benefit from the outcome of such proceeding.  Additionally, each Limited \nPartner will be required to indemnify the Fund and each Management Indemnified Person against taxes attributable \nto such Limited Partner.\n(c)\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the Fund will indemnify (and advance funds \npursuant to clause (d) below to cover) any Advisory Committee Indemnified Person, jointly and severally, for any \nLosses to which such Advisory Committee Indemnified Person may become subject in connection with serving on \nthe Advisory Committee or the Investor Advisory Committee, except to the extent that any such Loss results solely \nfrom the willful misfeasance or bad faith of such Advisory Committee Indemnified Person.\n(d)\nIn the event that any Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee \nIndemnified Person (each, an “Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) becomes involved \nin any capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation brought by or against any Person (including any Limited \nPartner or SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner) in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with \nthe Fund’s business or affairs (including a breach by any Limited Partner or SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner \n(other than any Limited Partner or SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner affiliated with Goldman Sachs) of this \nAgreement or the Limited Partner’s subscription agreement), the Fund will periodically reimburse such Management \nIndemnified Person or Advisory Committee Indemnified Person for its legal and other expenses (including the cost \nof any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith; provided, that such Management Indemnified \nPerson or Advisory Committee Indemnified Person shall promptly repay to the Fund the amount of any such \nreimbursed expenses paid to it if it shall ultimately be determined, by a court having appropriate jurisdiction in a \n16\ndecision that is not subject to appeal, that such Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee \nIndemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Fund in connection with such action, proceeding or \ninvestigation as provided in clause (b), clause (c) or this clause (d), as applicable; provided, further, that the Fund \nshall not pursuant to this Section 5.6(d) advance any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with the defense \nof any action or proceeding brought by a majority in interest of the investors in the Underlying Funds against a \nManagement Indemnified Person.\n(e)\nIf for any reason (other than, in the case of any Management Indemnified Person, the \ngross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or fraud of such Management Indemnified Person or any material \nviolation of any applicable securities law or any other intentional criminal wrongdoing on the part of such \nManagement Indemnified Person and in the case of any Advisory Committee Indemnified Person, the willful \nmisfeasance or bad faith of such Advisory Committee Indemnified Person) the foregoing indemnification, \nreimbursement or advance is unavailable to such Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee \nIndemnified Person, or is insufficient to hold either harmless, then the Fund shall contribute to the amount paid or \npayable by such Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee Indemnified Person as a result of such \nLoss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Fund on the one \nhand and such Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee Indemnified Person on the other hand but \nalso the relative fault of the Fund and such Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee Indemnified \nPerson, as well as any relevant equitable considerations.\n(f)\nThe reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations of the Fund (or the General \nPartner in the event the Fund has been dissolved) under this Section 5.6 shall be in addition to any liability which the \nFund may otherwise have, shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to the officers, directors, managers, \npartners, managing directors, stockholders, members, other equity holders, employees and controlling Persons (if \nany) of each Management Indemnified Person and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, \nassigns, heirs and personal representatives of any Management Indemnified Persons.\n(g)\nThe reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations provided by this Section 5.6 \nshall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Management Indemnified Person may be \nentitled under any agreement, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to action in a Management Indemnified \nPerson’s official capacity and to action in another capacity, and shall continue as to a Management Indemnified \nPerson who shall have ceased to have an official capacity for acts or omissions during such official capacity (or \notherwise when acting at the request of the Fund, the General Partner or the Investment Manager) and shall be \nbinding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of any \nManagement Indemnified Persons.  \n(h)\nThe General Partner shall have power to purchase and maintain reasonable insurance on \nbehalf of the General Partner and the other Management Indemnified Persons at the expense of the Fund, against \nany liability that may be asserted against or incurred by them in any such capacity or arising out of the General \nPartner’s or such Management Indemnified Person’s status as such, whether or not the Fund would have the power \nto indemnify the Management Indemnified Persons against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.\n(i)\nNothing in this Agreement, the subscription agreements or any related document or \nagreement shall constitute a waiver or limitation of the General Partner’s, Investment Manager’s, and/or Goldman \nSach’s potential liability, or of any rights which a Partner or the Fund may have, under applicable securities laws or \nother laws which may not be waived, including any fiduciary duty arising under the Investment Advisers Act of \n1940 (the “Advisers Act”).\n(j)\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 5.6 \nshall not be construed so as to provide for the indemnification of any Management Indemnified Person for any \nliability (including liability under U.S. federal securities laws which, under certain circumstances, impose liability \non Persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in \nviolation of applicable law, but shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.6 to the fullest \nextent permitted by law.\n17\n(k)\nThe assets of the Fund and the amount of the Limited Partners’ and the SOX Insider \nPreferred Limited Partners’ aggregate capital commitments shall be available to satisfy the indemnity and \ncontribution obligations of the Fund under this Section 5.6; in addition, the General Partner may require the other \nPartners (or Persons who were formerly Partners) to contribute again to the Fund any such obligations an amount \nequal to amounts previously distributed to Limited Partners or the SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partners.  The \nGeneral Partner may provide each affected Partner with an invoice setting forth the amount owed by the Limited \nPartner or the SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partner for amounts due in respect of any indemnity and contribution \nobligations.  Each Partner shall be obligated to pay the invoiced amount promptly upon request by the General \nPartner.  Any unpaid amount shall constitute an obligation of the Partner and shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate \nor a higher commercially reasonable rate as determined by the General Partner, and that amount, together with \naccrued interest, shall be debited from any distributions otherwise to be made to the Partner.\n(l)\nEach Management Indemnified Person may rely upon and shall be protected in acting or \nrefraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, \nconsent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or \npresented by the proper party or parties.\n(m)\nEach Management Indemnified Person shall be entitled, to the fullest extent of the law, to \nrely in good faith upon any and all sources enumerated in Section 17-407(c) of the Delaware Act, and any act or \nomission taken or suffered by such Management Indemnified Person in reasonable reliance on such source or \nsources shall in no event subject the Management Indemnified Person to liability to the Fund or to any Partner or to \nany other Person.  All Partners hereby acknowledge and agree that each Management Indemnified Person is entitled \nto the same right of reliance and protection from liability as the General Partner.\n(n)\nThe General Partner may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any \nduties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the General Partner shall not be responsible \nfor any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with reasonable care by it \nhereunder.\n(o)\nThe General Partner is specifically authorized and empowered, for and on behalf of the \nFund, to enter into any agreement or undertaking with any Management Indemnified Person or Advisory Committee \nIndemnified Person not itself a party to this Agreement that the General Partner considers to be necessary or \nadvisable to give full effect to the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Agreement.\n(p)\nThe foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive any termination of this \nAgreement and any Limited Partner ceasing to be a limited partner of the Fund.\nArticle VI\nCapital Commitments, Defaults and Accounts;\nAggregate Capital Contributions; Accounting and Valuation;\nAllocations; Reinvestment and Distributions\n6.1.\nCapital Commitments, Defaults and Accounts.\n(a)\n[           ]\nThe General Partner at any time may cause the Fund to retain proceeds to pay (or establish \nreserves for) any of the Fund’s current or anticipated direct or indirect obligations (including indebtedness, \nmanagement fees and other Fund Expenses, as well as obligations relating to current or additional investments) and \nmay also offset an amount that would otherwise be distributed to Limited Partners against amounts due pursuant to \ncapital calls or otherwise.  One or more of the Underlying Funds may have the ability to retain and reinvest proceeds \nor distribute proceeds to investors (including the Fund) and subsequently recall those proceeds for re-investment, as \ndescribed in the governing documents of the Underlying Funds, (any such proceeds, “Underlying Fund Recyclable \n18\nProceeds”).  Accordingly, the Fund may retain distributions that would otherwise be made to, or recall distributions \npreviously made to, its Limited Partners.  A Limited Partner’s available commitment will not be impacted if the \nFund retains, or distributes and subsequently recalls, any Underlying Fund Recyclable Proceeds.\n(b)\nIf any Limited Partner fails to pay any installment of such Limited Partner’s capital \ncommitment or any other payment required by this Agreement or his, her or its subscription agreement when due, \nthe General Partner will have the right (in addition to any available recourse), but not the obligation, to charge such \nLimited Partner interest on the late payment from the due date until the day it is paid.  Interest shall be charged at the \nInterest Rate or such higher commercially reasonable rate as determined by the General Partner from and including \nthe due date of the installment until, but not including, the date it is paid.\n(c)\nIf any Limited Partner (a “Defaulting Limited Partner”) other than an Institutional \nLimited Partner, fails to pay any installment of such Limited Partner’s capital commitment or fails to make any other \npayment required by this Agreement or his, her or its subscription agreement within thirty (30) calendar days (unless \nsuch period is otherwise extended by the General Partner) (a “Default”) from the date on which such installment is \ndue, (the due date of any such delinquent capital contribution or other payment, the “Default Date”) the General \nPartner will have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem, purchase or cause the Transfer of the Defaulting \nLimited Partner’s entire interest in the Fund to one or more Persons, including Goldman Sachs, another Limited \nPartner or other Eligible Investors, on the first Purchase Date following Goldman Sachs’ notification of its election \nto exercise this right at a price (the “Default Price”) equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Minimum Purchase \nPrice [           ] payable in cash, in kind or by delivery of a note (or any combination of the foregoing) and on such \nother terms and conditions as the General Partner may determine [           ].\nIn addition, the General Partner may undertake any one or more of the following remedies: (i) \n[           ], (ii) allowing the Defaulting Limited Partner to withdraw from the Fund at the Default Price and in \naccordance with the terms of Section 8.9, (iii) causing the Defaulting Limited Partner to forfeit its Participating \nInterest for no consideration (whether or not distributed or vested), and (iv) taking any other actions available to the \nGeneral Partner under law and equity.\n(d)\nIf an Institutional Limited Partner fails to pay the entire amount of any installment or \nother required payment, the foregoing purchase rights shall apply only to the portion of such Institutional Limited \nPartner’s Interest that is attributable to the Indirect Investor in respect of the amount that was not paid.  The failure \nto pay any installment or other required payment when due shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, and such \nDefaulting Limited Partner shall remain liable for such breach regardless of any purchase by Goldman Sachs of the \nDefaulting Limited Partner’s Participating Interest in the Fund (or portion thereof, in the case of an Institutional \nLimited Partner).  Goldman Sachs may, but is not required to, offer any Participating Interest so acquired to other \nLimited Partners or any other Persons, who meet, in the judgment of the General Partner, the requirements to \nbecome a Limited Partner.  Any such sale by Goldman Sachs shall be treated as a Transfer for purposes of this \nAgreement and shall be subject to and effected only in accordance with Article VIII.\n(e)\n[           ]\n(f)\nBy subscribing to the Fund, each Limited Partner authorizes Goldman Sachs to deduct \nwithout prior notice any Default amount(s) due by such Limited Partner from (i) any other Goldman Sachs \nemployee special investments in which such Limited Partner is invested (now or at any time in the future), including \nby withholding from distributions, (ii) any cash, any proceeds from the liquidation of any marketable securities, \nincluding Goldman Sachs stock, and/or any other amounts held in the Limited Partner’s Goldman Sachs brokerage \naccount(s), (iii) any amounts paid in connection with the Limited Partner’s departure from Goldman Sachs, and \n(iv) any other amounts owed to such Limited Partner by Goldman Sachs (including income, compensation, or \nequity-based awards), to the extent permitted by applicable law and any applicable plans, programs or agreements.  \nIn addition, the Fund (1) may withdraw funds credited to a Limited Partner’s Capital Account in the Fund if \n19\nnecessary to satisfy any obligation owed by such Limited Partner to Goldman Sachs and (2) to the extent such funds \nare insufficient, may cause such Limited Partner’s Interest in the Fund to be forfeited or reallocated.\n6.2.\nAdditional Capital Contributions.  Except for [           ] the indemnity obligations set forth in \nSection 8.5 arising in connection with certain Transfers, [           ], the obligation to return distributions in connection \nwith the indemnification and contribution obligations set forth in Section 5.6 and the obligation to contribute capital \nup to the amount of Underlying Fund Recyclable Proceeds in accordance with Section 6.1(a) and the clawback set \nforth in Section 6.9, no Limited Partner shall be required or, except with the express written consent of the General \nPartner, permitted to make aggregate payments or contributions of capital to the Fund in excess of such Limited \nPartner’s capital commitment, which shall be contributed as and when required by Section 6.1 and Article VII.  The \nGeneral Partner may make, but will not be obligated to make, voluntary additional capital contributions in such \namounts and at such times as it may choose, upon notification thereof to all Limited Partners and the failure of three-\nquarters in interest of the Limited Partners to object thereto in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of notice \nthereof.\n6.3.\nFiscal and Taxable Year.  Unless the General Partner at any time shall otherwise determine the \nfiscal year and taxable year of the Fund shall each end on December 31 of each year.\n6.4.\nPartners’ Capital Accounts.\n(a)\nA capital account (“Capital Account”) shall be established and maintained in the records \nof the Fund for each Partner and in respect of each class of Interests held by such Partner.  A Partner’s Capital \nAccount in respect of a class of Interests will, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, be:\n(i)\nincreased by [           ] allocations to such Partner in respect of that class of \nInterests of Fund income and gain [           ]; and\n(ii)\ndecreased by (A) the amount of money or the net fair value of property \ndistributed to such Partner by the Fund in respect of that class of Interests, (B) allocations to such Partner in \nrespect of that class of Interests of Fund loss and deduction [           ].\nIf any Limited Partner Transfers all or any portion of his, her or its Interests (including as provided \nin Section 6.1), the Capital Account of such transferor Limited Partner that is attributable to such portion will carry \nover to the transferee Limited Partner.  A Partner’s aggregate Capital Account shall equal the sum of his, her or its \nCapital Accounts maintained in respect of each class of Interests held by such Partner.\nAs used herein, a Partner Capital Account means a Partner’s aggregate Capital Account or a \nPartner’s Capital Account in respect of a particular class of Interests as the context so requires.\n(b)\nThe Investment Manager shall determine the value or oversee the valuation of each \nLimited Partner’s Capital Account as of the close of (i) the annual accounting period and (ii) the period ending with \nthe distribution pursuant to Section 9.2 by treating each Fund Investment as having been disposed of for its fair \nvalue on the earlier of the last day of such period or the day such Fund Investment was actually disposed of or an In-\nkind Distribution was made, as the case may be, during such period, and by applying the allocation principles set \nforth in Section 6.5.  Unrealized gains and losses shall be determined with respect to each Fund Investment owned \nby the Fund by reference to the value at which such Fund Investment is carried on the balance sheet of the Fund as \ndetermined by the Investment Manager in accordance with the valuation principles used in the quarterly financial \nstatements of the Fund prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (the \n“Financial Statement Value”).  The reasonableness and appropriateness of the procedure utilized to determine such \nFinancial Statement Values shall be reviewed annually by the Fund’s independent auditors in connection with the \nexamination of the Fund’s annual financial statements.  The determination of capital gains and losses with respect to \nany Fund Investment shall take into account any related fees and expenses incurred in connection with the \nacquisition and disposition of such Fund Investment, including Fund Expenses which are capitalized into the basis \nof a Fund Investment.\n20\n6.5.\nAllocation of Profits and Losses.\n(a)\nThe Fund’s profits and losses for any year shall be determined by the General Partner in \naccordance with GAAP and procedures using the accrual method (with investments carried at their fair value as \ndetermined by the General Partner or Persons selected by it).  The General Partner shall determine the allocation \nperiods under this Section 6.5, and any period in respect of which an allocation is made is referred to herein as an \n“Allocation Period.”\n(b)\nProfits and losses of the Fund for each Allocation Period shall be allocated as follows, \nsubject, in each case, to Section 6.5(c) and any adjustments the General Partner determines appropriate so as to take \ninto account (i) any Default by a Limited Partner, (ii) [           ] (iii) any deemed distribution of withholding and/or \nother taxes that are allocable or attributable to a particular Limited Partner and (iv) the forfeiture of any Class O \nInterests held by each Limited Partner, (v) [           ], and (vi) any clawback of Carried Interest:\n(i)\n[           ];\n(ii)\n[           ];\n(iii)\n[           ];\n(iv)\n[           ]\n(v)\nan amount equal to the Carried Interest received directly from the Carried \nInterest Paying Funds (including, for purposes hereof, any investment vehicle directly or indirectly held by \none or more of the Carried Interest Paying Funds by which Carried Interest is paid) shall be allocated \namong the Class O Limited Partners in proportion to their respective Class O Percentages.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may determine not to allocate Borrowing \nExpenses to any, all or certain Participating Interests held by SOX Insiders, including Institutional Limited Partners, \nif any (to the extent of the portion of any Institutional Limited Partner’s Participating Interests held directly or \nindirectly by SOX Insiders), in the event SOX Insiders have pre-funded their capital calls or purchased SOX Insider \nPreferred Interests as contemplated by Section 6.1.  Allocations with respect to SOX Insider Preferred Interests shall \nbe made in accordance with Section 7.2.\n(c)\nAllocations for U.S. federal income tax purposes will generally follow the allocations \ndescribed above (except that investments will not generally be marked to market).\n(d)\nIt is the intention of the parties that, to the extent possible and consistent with the \neconomics of this Agreement, the allocations made by the General Partner be respected for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes and comply with Section 704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and \nTreasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and shall be interpreted and applied in a \nmanner consistent with Section 704 and such Treasury Regulations.  In furtherance of this intention a “qualified \nincome offset provision” and any such other provision described in applicable regulations and deemed desirable by \nthe General Partner shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any implication to the \ncontrary contained herein, the General Partner shall have authority to make or refrain from making available tax \nelections and to choose from all available tax accounting methodologies in implementing the foregoing.  To the \nextent consistent with applicable law, the General Partner may specially allocate income to any Partner, the status of \nwhich resulted in recognition of such income or otherwise alters the distribution or allocation provisions herein so \nthat such Partner bears the consequences of such recognition.  The General Partner’s determination of allocations \nshall be binding upon all parties.\n(e)\nAllocation of Certain Taxes and Income.  Taxes (including any U.S. or non-U.S. income, \nwithholding and similar taxes paid by Subsidiaries) will be allocated annually to the Partners in the same proportion \n21\nthat the income in that year in respect of which such taxes are paid is allocated; provided, however, that where any \nsuch tax payable by the Fund or a Subsidiary is calculated, under applicable law, with respect to income allocable to \nsome but not all of the Partners, or, to the extent income allocable to some of the Partners is exempt from tax in the \nhands of the Fund (or such taxes are reduced in respect of income allocated to certain Partners), or such tax arises as \na result of the status of one or more Partners (or class of Partners), the failure by one or more Partners to comply \nwith their obligations under Section 10.5, or the treatment or characterization for applicable tax purposes of any \nentity, payment or instrument by one or more Partners (or class of Partners), such taxes shall be allocated, as \nreasonably determined by the General Partner, among such Partners to whom allocations of income are subject to \ntax in the hands of the Fund (or to reflect such reductions) or to whom such taxes are otherwise properly allocable.  \nTo the extent consistent with applicable law, the General Partner may specially allocate income to any Limited \nPartner the status of which resulted in recognition of such income or otherwise alter the distribution or allocation \nprovisions herein so that such Limited Partner bears the consequences of such recognition.\n(f)\nCertain Definitions.\n(i)\n[           ]\n(ii)\n“Borrowing Expenses” means all amounts in respect of premium, discount and \ninterest on, and all costs, expenses, commissions and fees relating to, any incurrence, modification, \namendment, restructuring, refinancing, cancellation or repayment of the direct or indirect indebtedness of \nthe Fund and relating to notes and guarantees and providing any credit support.\n(iii)\n[           ]\n(iv)\n[           ]\n(v)\n[           ]\n(vi)\n[           ]\n(vii)\n[           ]\n(viii)\n[           ]\n(ix)\n“Class O Percentage” means, with respect to any Class O Limited Partner and \nany date of determination, a fraction, the numerator of which is the Class O Interest of such Limited \nPartner, and the denominator of which is the aggregate Class O Interests.  Each Class O Limited Partner’s \ninitial Class O Percentage will be determined with respect to a Class O Limited Partner based upon the \nClass O Interests offered to a Class O Limited Partner (or in the case of an investor who is an Affiliated \nInvestor Entity, its related Offeree) as described in the Offering Memorandum.  A Class O Limited \nPartner’s Class O Percentage may be adjusted from time to time, including in connection with any whole or \npartial withdrawal, Transfer or forfeiture of a Class O Limited Partner’s Class O Interest, or any grant of \nadditional Class O Interests to a Class O Limited Partner in accordance with this Agreement, as determined \nby the General Partner in its discretion.  The General Partner’s determination of the adjusted Class O \nPercentage of a Class O Limited Partner for purposes of any distribution shall be conclusive and binding on \nall Limited Partners.\n(x)\n“FATCA” means, Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (or any amended or \nsuccessor provisions), any current or future regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof, any \nagreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, any fiscal or regulatory legislation, \nrules or practices adopted pursuant to any applicable intergovernmental agreement entered into in \nconnection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code, and any other similar legislation, \nregulations or guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction which seeks to implement similar financial \naccount information reporting and/or withholding tax regimes.\n22\n(xi)\n[           ]\n(xii)\n[           ]\n(xiii)\n“Person” means, any individual, partnership, limited liability company, \ncorporation, trust, estate, association or other entity, or any other custodian or nominee or any individual or \nentity in its own or any representative capacity.\n6.6.\nDistributions to Limited Partners.\n(a)\nGeneral.  The amount and timing of distributions to each Limited Partner shall be at the \nsole discretion of the General Partner.  The General Partner will have the right to withhold distributions if a Limited \nPartner fails to comply with any Goldman Sachs policy or request.  In addition, (i) the timing of distributions may \nvary among the classes of Limited Partners, in the sole discretion of the General Partner and (ii) the General Partner \nmay take into account legal, tax, regulatory or other considerations, including to comply with regulatory or \nlegislative rules, when determining the timing of any payments (including, but not limited to, distributions) with \nrespect to one or more Limited Partners (including considerations applicable to a Limited Partner’s status as an \nemployee of Goldman Sachs) and/or classes, as it or Goldman Sachs determines is necessary or advisable, it being \nunderstood that varying regional considerations may result in one or more Limited Partners receiving such payments \nearlier than one or more other Limited Partners.  Underlying Fund Recyclable Proceeds and other amounts held by \nthe Fund may be retained in the Fund for reinvestment or distributed to the Limited Partners and subsequently \nrecalled for reinvestment by the Fund, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 6.1.  Any Underlying Fund \nRecyclable Proceeds so retained or recalled shall not reduce the available capital commitments of the Limited \nPartners.  The General Partner at any time may cause the Fund to retain any proceeds from any investment \n(including the amount of the capital contribution relating to that investment) it receives to pay (or establish reserves \nfor) any of the Fund’s current or anticipated direct or indirect obligations (including indebtedness, management fees \nand other Fund Expenses, as well as obligations relating to current or additional investments) and may also offset an \namount that would otherwise be distributed to Limited Partners (including amounts payable in respect of a different \nclass of Interests owned by the Limited Partner) against amounts due pursuant to capital calls or otherwise.  [           ]  \nThe General Partner does not intend to make any distributions in respect of Carried Interest (excluding the \ndistribution of Carried Interest Tax Distribution Amounts in respect of Carried Interest) until at least [   ].  Moreover, \nthe General Partner does not intend to make any distributions of Carried Interest until the likelihood of clawback is \nremote.\n(b)\nNotwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that \ndistributions from, or proceeds from the disposition of, Fund Investments are retained (rather than distributed, \nsubject to recall), the General Partner will have the authority to adjust distributions and allocations to cause each \nPartner to receive, to the extent possible, the same distributions and allocations (as determined without giving effect \nto the individual tax treatment of any Partner) that each such Partner would have received had the amounts been \ndistributed and the Partners made capital contributions in accordance with Section 6.1 (so that each Limited Partner \nbears his, her or its share of Fund Expenses that are not borne by the Partners in proportion to their capital \ncommitments, bears amounts attributable to such Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.5(e), and bears any other \nFund Expenses according to such Partner’s capital commitment, and so that each Limited Partner receives an \nappropriate amount of distributions and allocations as contemplated herein, in each case as determined by the \nGeneral Partner).\nAny amounts that become available for distribution but are not distributed, including the Carried \nInterest, may be invested in money market instruments and/or other marketable securities, either directly or through \nfunds that are managed by Goldman Sachs.  The General Partner may determine to make distributions to the \nInstitutional Limited Partners prior to making distributions to the other Limited Partners, in which case the General \nPartner shall make subsequent distributions disproportionately to the other Limited Partners until the amounts \ndistributed to each other Limited Partner hereunder would equal the amount each such Limited Partner would have \nreceived had no such special distributions been made to the Institutional Limited Partners.  All distributions will be \n23\nmade net of any taxes payable by the Fund or by entities in which the Fund invests (including, for example, any \nlocal, non-U.S. withholding or other taxes).\nThe General Partner in its discretion may withhold from amounts otherwise distributable to a \nLimited Partner pursuant to this Section 6.6 [           ] amounts withheld pursuant to Section 6.6(e) in respect of taxes \nallocable to such Limited Partner.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision shall limit in any way \nthe General Partner’s discretion to maintain reserves to meet potential investment needs or other obligations of the \nFund.\n(c)\nDistributions will generally be made as follows, subject, in each case, to any adjustments \nthe General Partner determines appropriate so as to take into account (i) any Default by a Limited Partner, (ii) \n[           ], (iii) any deemed distribution of withholding and/or other taxes that are allocable or attributable to a \nparticular Limited Partner and (iv) the forfeiture of any Class O Interests held by each Limited Partner, (v) [           ], \nand (vi) any clawback of Carried Interest.\n(i)\n[           ]\n(ii)\n[           ]\n(iii)\n[           ]\n(iv)\n[           ]\n(v)\nDistributions to Holders of Class O Interests.  Subject to Section 6.6(a) and \nSection 6.6(c), the available cash to be distributed, with respect to the Carried Interest, including any tax \ndistribution amount (each, a “Carried Interest Tax Distribution Amount”) received by the Fund in its \ncapacity as a direct or indirect recipient of Carried Interest for purposes of the respective operating \nagreements of the Carried Interest Paying Funds (including, for purposes hereof, any investment vehicle \ndirectly or indirectly held by one or more of Carried Interest Paying Funds by which Carried Interest is \npaid), will be distributed among the Class O Limited Partners in proportion to their Class O Percentages, \nsubject to any “Incremental Hurdle” or “Notch Amount” as described in the Offering Memorandum.\n(vi)\nAdjustments to Class O and Sharing Percentages.  Each Class O Limited Partner \nacknowledges that the Sharing Percentage and/or the Class O Limited Partners’ Class O Percentages may \nbe adjusted if there are aggregate commitments to the Carried Interest Paying Funds in excess of the \naggregate amount of commitments that were projected in respect of the Carried Interest Paying Funds in \nconnection with the determination of the total number of Carried Interest points offered to Class O Limited \nPartners (or in the case of investors who are Affiliated Investor Entities, their related Offerees), in order to \ngive effect to changes in the points as described in the Offering Memorandum.  The General Partner may \nalso determine that any commitments in excess of the initial projection will not be considered part of the \nCarried Interest Paying Funds for purposes of this Agreement.  Any determination described in this Section \n6.6(c)(vi) will be made in Goldman Sachs’ sole discretion and without prior notice to the holders of Class \nO Interests.  Goldman Sachs may also determine whether or not any additional capital commitments \nsubsequent to the final closing of the Carried Interest Paying Funds are included in the Carried Interest \nPaying Funds.\n(vii)\nDistributions to Holders of SOX Insider Preferred Interests.  Distributions with \nrespect to SOX Insider Preferred Interests shall be made in accordance with Section 7.2.\n24\n(d)\nIn-kind Distributions.  The General Partner may make in kind distributions of property \n(“In-kind Distributions”) (including interests denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar) which generally \nshall be distributed among the Partners in the same proportions as cash of equivalent value would be distributed if \nIn-kind Distributions had been sold and the proceeds distributed pursuant to this Section 6.6, provided that the Fund \nmay make a non-pro rata distribution of property (including distributing certain types of property to certain Partners \nand cash or other types of property to other Partners), pursuant to the redemption or purchase of the Interests by the \nFund of one or more Partners (including pursuant to Section 8.7 or 8.9) or otherwise where the General Partner \ndetermines a non-pro rata distribution is appropriate or necessary.  In-kind Distributions shall be valued at their fair \nvalue as determined by the investment managers of the Underlying Funds; provided that the investment managers of \nthe Underlying Funds may hire third parties to make valuation determination or estimation, or may delegate \nvaluation determination or estimation to third parties, and the investment managers of the Underlying Funds (or the \nInvestment Manager) shall be entitled to rely upon such determinations or estimates.  Where securities are to be \ndistributed in kind among all or a group of Partners, securities will be distributed to all such Partners who would \nreceive a specified minimum number of securities, and, as an administrative convenience, the securities distributable \nto Partners who would receive fewer securities may, instead, be distributed to a selling pool for sale on behalf of \nthese Partners.  In this way, all Partners entitled to such distribution will be treated as receiving a distribution at the \nsame time.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, money or other property wrongfully \ndistributed to any Partners in violation of this Agreement may be recovered by the Fund.\n(e)\nWithholding and Other Taxes.\n(i)\nThe General Partner may withhold and/or pay any taxes with respect to any \nLimited Partner’s share of Fund taxable income (or which relate to a predecessor Interest or to a transfer (or \ndeemed transfer) of such Limited Partner’s Interest) (including any taxes paid by the Fund as a result of an \naudit adjustment or a change in law), and any such taxes may be withheld from any distribution otherwise \npayable to such Limited Partner.  Taxes so withheld (or paid), or taxes withheld on amounts directly or \nindirectly payable to the Fund, a financing vehicle, a Fund Investment Holding Corporation, a Fund \nInvestment Holding Partnership, or a pass-through vehicle in which the Fund has an investment and taxes \notherwise directly or indirectly paid by the Fund, a financing vehicle or such pass-through vehicle may, in \nthe General Partner’s discretion, be treated for purposes of this Agreement (including Section 6.6) as \ndistributed to the Partners to which such taxes are properly allocable (including as a result of the status of a \nPartner (or class of Partners) or the treatment or characterization for applicable tax purposes of any entity, \npayment or instrument by any Partner (or class of Partners)) and deemed paid by such Partners to the \nrelevant taxing jurisdiction [           ].\n(ii)\nEach Limited Partner (or former Limited Partner) hereby agrees to indemnify \nand hold harmless the Fund, any Subsidiary, the Management Indemnified Persons and the Advisory \nCommittee Indemnified Persons and the other Limited Partners from and against any withholding or other \ntax-related liability (including any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax, interest or failure to \nwithhold taxes) directly or indirectly payable (or otherwise borne) by the Fund, including through \nInvestment Vehicles, that arise with respect to, or as a result of, income attributable to such Limited \nPartner, distributions or other payments to such Limited Partner, the status of such Limited Partner (or class \nof Limited Partners including such Limited Partner), the failure by such Limited Partner to comply with its \nobligations under Section 10.5, or the treatment or characterization for applicable tax purposes of any \nentity, payment or instrument by such Limited Partner (or class of Limited Partners including such Limited \nPartner) (including taxes indemnified under Section 5.6).  For the avoidance of doubt, any such indemnity \nmay be structured as a contribution to the Fund and will not be considered a capital contribution for \npurposes of this Agreement, nor shall any requirement that any such contribution be paid be considered a \ncapital call.  The amount of any taxes in respect of which a Limited Partner makes such a contribution shall \nnot be treated as deemed distributed as described above.  The foregoing provision of this Section 6.6(e) \nshall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n25\nRecognizing the complexity of the distributions pursuant to this Section 6.6, the General Partner is \nauthorized to modify these distributions to ensure that they achieve the intended results without the consent of a \nLimited Partner or the Limited Partners, notwithstanding Section 11.2.\n6.7.\nAllocation in Case of Transfers.  In the event of a Transfer of an Interest during a taxable year of \nthe Fund, allocations of income, gain, loss, deductions and credits and items of tax preference and other tax items of \nthe Fund between the transferor and the transferee will be based on the portions of such taxable year during which \neach owned the Interest or as the transferor and the transferee may agree, provided that in either case the General \nPartner shall have consented to such allocation and the transferor and the transferee shall have agreed to reimburse \nthe Fund for any incremental accounting fees and other expenses incurred by the Fund in making such allocation.  \n[           ]\n6.8.\n[           ]\n6.9.\nClawback\n.  Any distributions of Carried Interest to a Limited Partner (including the General Partner) in excess of the \nCarried Interest allocable to such Limited Partner as described in Section 6.5 will be subject to clawback by the \nGeneral Partner.  In addition, the Fund may become obligated to recontribute all or a portion of the Carried Interest \nto one or more of the Carried Interest Paying Funds (including, for purposes hereof, any investment vehicle directly \nor indirectly held by one or more of the Carried Interest Paying Funds by which Carried Interest is paid) if the \ninvestors in such Carried Interest Paying Fund have not received the preferred return provided for in the applicable \noperating agreement of such Carried Interest Paying Fund or are otherwise entitled to clawback payments pursuant \nto the operating agreement of such Carried Interest Paying Fund.  Moreover, the Fund may become obligated to \nrecontribute all or a portion of the Carried Interest received from one or more of the Carried Interest Paying Funds if \nthe distributions made by such Carried Interest Paying Fund in respect of such amounts exceed the respective \nCarried Interest accrued as of certain measurement dates.  Each of the General Partner and each Class O Limited \nPartner agrees that, in any of the foregoing cases, such Class O Limited Partner will recontribute to the Fund such \nLimited Partner’s appropriate share of the Carried Interest previously distributed to such Limited Partner that must \nbe recontributed to such Carried Interest Paying Fund (including, for purposes hereof, any investment vehicle \ndirectly or indirectly held by one or more of the Carried Interest Paying Funds by which Carried Interest is paid) (net \nof any Carried Interest Tax Distribution Amount distributed in respect of such recontributed Carried Interest), \npromptly upon request by the General Partner.  The General Partner may provide each Class O Limited Partner with \nan invoice setting forth the amount owing by the Class O Limited Partner for amounts due in respect of any \nclawback obligations, and each Class O Limited Partner shall be obligated to pay the invoiced amount promptly \nupon request by the General Partner.  Any unpaid amount shall constitute an obligation of the Class O Limited \nPartner and shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate, and that amount, together with accrued interest, shall be debited \nfrom any distributions otherwise to be made to the Class O Limited Partner or from other sources (including but not \nlimited to any source listed in Section 6.1(f)).\n6.10.\nModifications to Allocations and/or Distributions.  The General Partner may make allocations and/\nor distributions in a manner other than as described in this Article VI, including disproportionate allocations of gain \nor loss and/or disproportionate distributions to the extent required under applicable laws, rules and regulations, or \notherwise deemed advisable or necessary by the General Partner in its discretion in order to give economic effect to \nthe provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that all such allocations are intended to be made in a manner \nsuch that all Class O Interests will be treated as “profits interests” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nArticle VII\nSarbanes-Oxley Act; SOX Insider Preferred Interests;\nModification of SOX Insiders’ Interests;\nLimitation on Pledges\n7.1.\nPurchase of SOX Insider Preferred Interests; Issuance of SOX Insider Preferred Interests.\n(a)\nFor purposes of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( “SOX””), including \nSection 402 thereof and any rules, regulations or interpretations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or \n26\nits staff promulgated thereunder (“SOX § 402”), the Fund is authorized to issue, from time to time, one or more \nclasses of preferred limited partnership interests (“SOX Insider Preferred Interests” and the holder or holders of such \nSOX Insider Preferred Interests, “SOX Insider Preferred Limited Partners”), in such amounts as the General Partner \ndetermines, and the General Partner may require the purchase thereof by such of the Limited Partners as could, at \nany time and from time to time, in the judgment of the General Partner, be deemed to be (or to be Affiliated Investor \nEntities affiliated with) directors or executive officers (or equivalent thereof) of GS Group within the meaning of \nSOX § 402 (“SOX Insiders”).  Any such SOX Insider will be required to purchase the SOX Insider Preferred \nInterest no later than a date and time set by the General Partner.  The General Partner shall use commercially \nreasonable efforts to provide no less than five (5) days’ notice to any Limited Partner required to purchase a SOX \nInsider Preferred Interest.\n(b)\nThe General Partner may require any subsequently admitted Institutional Limited Partner \nto (i) purchase a SOX Insider Preferred Interest if and to the extent that the General Partner determines, or the \nmanager or general partner of such Institutional Limited Partner notifies the General Partner, that one or more \nIndirect Investors in such Institutional Limited Partner are SOX Insiders and (ii) allocate such SOX Insider Preferred \nInterest to such Indirect Investors under such methods as the General Partner or that the manager or general partner \nof the Institutional Limited Partner deems appropriate.\n(c)\nThe General Partner will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid requiring a \nLimited Partner to contribute, in the aggregate, more than such Limited Partner’s capital commitment towards such \nLimited Partner’s Participating Interest and any SOX Insider Preferred Interest.\n7.2.\nTerms.  SOX Insider Preferred Interests shall be entitled to the following rights and subject to the \nfollowing terms:\n(a)\nDistributions.  Each SOX Insider Preferred Interest shall entitle the holder thereof to \nreceive a preferred distribution in respect of the capital contributed, as an expense of the Fund, at a rate and at times \nto be determined by the General Partner and notified to the Limited Partner required to purchase such SOX Insider \nPreferred Interest.  The General Partner expects that the distribution rate will equal the rate payable from time to \ntime, directly or indirectly, by the Fund, or any Investment Vehicle in which it has invested, on borrowings generally \nsecured by unfunded capital commitments of the direct or indirect investors in the applicable borrower.\n(b)\nPreference.  Each SOX Insider Preferred Interest shall have a preference over all Interests \n(other than other SOX Insider Preferred Interests) as to the payment of distributions and as to the payment of the \nliquidation preference (which shall be equal to the amount invested in such SOX Insider Preferred Interest plus any \naccrued but unpaid distributions) upon the redemption of any SOX Insider Preferred Interest or the winding up of \nthe Fund.  SOX Insider Preferred Interests shall be pari passu with respect to each other.\n(c)\nRedemption; Application to Satisfy Capital Calls.  Notwithstanding anything to the \ncontrary herein, the General Partner may from time to time redeem any outstanding SOX Insider Preferred Interests \nin whole or in part.  The General Partner may, but shall not be obligated to, apply the proceeds from the redemption \nof a SOX Insider Preferred Interest to satisfy amounts required to be contributed by applicable SOX Insider \nPreferred Limited Partners in respect of called capital.\n(d)\nTransfer Restricted.  SOX Insider Preferred Interests shall be subject to the transfer \nrestrictions set forth in Article VIII to the same extent as the other Interests.\n(e)\nAllocation of Profits and Losses.  Profits or losses of the Fund (if any) attributable to a \nSOX Insider Preferred Interest shall, unless otherwise determined by the General Partner, be allocated solely to the \nholder of such SOX Insider Preferred Interest.\n(f)\nNo Other Rights.  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, a SOX Insider \nPreferred Interest will not entitle the holder thereof to any rights to participate in the profits or assets of the Fund or \nany other rights against the Fund or the Limited Partners with respect to the SOX Insider Preferred Interest.\n27\n7.3.\nModifications of SOX Insiders’ Interests; Voting Rights of SOX Insider Preferred Interests.\n(a)\nThe Limited Partners acknowledge that the provisions of SOX § 402 may impose \nconstraints on the ability of the General Partner, exercising prudence, to permit Limited Partners that are SOX \nInsiders or Affiliated Investor Entities affiliated with SOX Insiders to hold Interests on the same terms as other \nLimited Partners.  In light of these potential constraints, it is understood and agreed that the General Partner is \nauthorized, at any time and without notice to or the consent of any Limited Partner, to modify or redeem, in whole or \nin part, Interests held from time to time by SOX Insiders or Affiliated Investor Entities affiliated with SOX Insiders, \nas the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance by Goldman Sachs with SOX § 402; \nprovided, however, that the General Partner shall not effect any modification to an Interest that would materially \nadversely affect the Limited Partners who are not SOX Insiders or Affiliated Investor Entities affiliated with SOX \nInsiders without first complying with the procedure set forth in Section 11.2(a).\n(b)\nNotwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner \nmay at its election (but may determine not to) pledge, assign or otherwise make available as credit support the \nunfunded capital commitments of any Limited Partner who is a SOX Insider or the Affiliated Investor Entity of a \nSOX Insider, unless the General Partner determines that such pledge, assignment or availability may not comply \nwith SOX § 402.\nArticle VIII\nTransferability of Limited Partners’ Interests; Consequences of Departure, Breach of GS Agreements, etc.\n8.1.\nRestrictions on Transfer.\n(a)\nNo Limited Partner may, directly or indirectly, sell, exchange, transfer, assign, make a \ngift of, donate, bequeath, devise, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose, directly or indirectly (including \neffecting any direct or indirect transfer or other disposition of interests in, or any direct or indirect change in control \nof, any entity directly or indirectly investing in the Fund), of all or any portion of such Limited Partner’s Interest \n(each, a “Transfer”) except in accordance with this Article VIII.  The General Partner may waive any requirement of \nthis Article VIII with respect to any particular Transfer, except the provisions of Section 8.2.\n(b)\nSubject to the other requirements of this Article VIII, with the prior written consent of the \nGeneral Partner (which consent may be withheld by the General Partner in its discretion), a Limited Partner may \nTransfer all or any portion of such Limited Partner’s Interest to any Person approved by the General Partner (a \n“Transferee”).\n(c)\nIf any purported Transfer of an Interest by a Limited Partner is made other than in \naccordance with the terms of this Agreement (i) it shall be void, and neither the Fund nor the General Partner shall \nbe required to recognize any equitable or other claims to such Interest on the part of the purported Transferee thereof \nand (ii) the transferring Limited Partner shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Limited Partner.  Such default shall be \ngoverned by Section 6.1, and the General Partner may undertake any one or more of the remedies described in \nSection 6.1 with respect to such Defaulting Limited Partner.\n(d)\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.1, no Transfer of any kind \nmay be made unless it also complies with the requirements of Section 8.2.\n(e)\n[           ]\n8.2.\nCertain Conditions.

Any forfeited Carried Interest that is \nreallocated to new and/or existing Limited Partners may be subject to a different vesting schedule (including a \nshorter or longer vesting schedule).  Upon the forfeiture of all or a portion of a Limited Partner’s Class O Interest, \nsuch Limited Partner may be required, in the Investment Manager’s sole discretion, to return any Carried Interest \nTax Distribution Amount previously distributed in respect of such forfeited Class O Interest.  A conversion, \npurchase or Transfer of Interests or forfeiture of Class O Interests as described above may have adverse tax \nconsequences.\n(g)\n[           ]\n(h)\n[           ]\n(i)\nThe purchase price for any Interest acquired pursuant to Section 8.7(a), (b), (d), (e) or \n(l) shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such Limited Partner’s capital contributions plus interest at the \nInterest Rate (net of any distributions) (the “Net Contributed Capital”), and (ii) an amount equal to the then Fair \nValue of such Limited Partner’s Interest (such lesser amount, the “Minimum Purchase Price”), payable in cash, in \nkind or by delivery of a note (or any combination of the foregoing).  [           ]  For purposes hereof, the “Fair Value” \nof an Interest in the Fund shall be determined by the General Partner in its discretion at the time any such \nredemption, purchase, Transfer or withdrawal takes place (as determined without regard to the tax consequences of \nthe receipt of income or gain therefrom) as an amount equal to the fair market value of such Interest at such point in \ntime[           ].  A Transfer of an Interest as described herein may be made to Goldman Sachs, its affiliates, one or \n33\nmore Limited Partners or Eligible Investors, to the extent permitted by law, as determined by the General Partner in \nits sole discretion.  For the avoidance of doubt, such purchase price will take into account any distributions \npreviously made, and, in the case of Interests that are subject to retroactive conversion, any future distributions in \nrespect of these Interests may be adjusted by taking account of the distributions made before the date of conversion.  \nThe purchase price may reflect an illiquidity discount.  The Limited Partners hereby acknowledge that (x) if an \nInterest is sold to a third party buyer, the purchase price will reflect only what such third party buyer would be \nwilling to pay for the Interests, (y) in each case, the price of such Interests may represent a substantial discount to \nsuch Limited Partner’s Net Contributed Capital or Capital Account value, and (z) any redemption, purchase or \nTransfer of Interests may be payable in cash, in kind or by delivery of a note (or combination of any of the \nforegoing).\n(j)\nThe “Interest Rate” will be six-month SOFR plus 115 basis points, subject to change \nfrom time to time, and at any time, in the discretion of the General Partner (including, for the avoidance of doubt, \nthat the General Partner may at any time decide in its sole discretion to use a different benchmark).\n(k)\nPayment of the purchase price shall be made on May 30 of the year immediately \nfollowing the year during which Goldman Sachs or the Fund exercises its election to purchase or cause the Transfer \nof any Limited Partner’s Interest pursuant to this Agreement, or any other date as the General Partner may determine \nfrom time to time (any such date, a “Purchase Date”).  For this purpose, a payment will be deemed to have been paid \n(i) if payment is made by check, when it has been deposited by Goldman Sachs in the U.S. mail or delivered to a \nreputable courier service or (ii) if payment is made by deposit into a brokerage account, when the payment is \ndeposited into the Limited Partner’s or Related Employee’s (as the case may be) brokerage account.  Goldman Sachs \nwill have no obligation to provide any notice of purchase other than the notice accompanying payment.  The \neffective date of the purchase and the date of payment may be different days.  Notwithstanding anything to the \ncontrary in this Agreement, any Transfer upon a purchase pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall, for all purposes of this \nAgreement, be effective as of the close of business on the date determined by the General Partner.  If the effective \ndate of the Transfer is any date other than the date on which the price was calculated, then for purposes of \ndetermining the purchase price, the Limited Partner’s Capital Account balance shall be appropriately adjusted to \nreflect any contributions and distributions made in respect of such Limited Partner’s Interest after the date on which \nthe price was calculated.\n(l)\nIn addition to the other rights that Goldman Sachs has under this Section 8.7, if Goldman \nSachs determines that a Limited Partner or a Related Employee may have breached any of his, her or its \nrepresentations, warranties or covenants made in the subscription agreement or otherwise made in connection with \nthe acquisition of an Interest, then the General Partner shall have the right to cause the redemption, purchase, \nTransfer or forfeiture, or require the withdrawal, of the Limited Partner’s Interest on the Purchase Date, using the \npurchase price calculation set forth in Section 8.7(h), payable in cash, in kind or by delivery of a note (or any \ncombination of the foregoing), or, in the case of forfeiture, for no consideration.  Additionally, the General Partner, \nin its sole discretion and without the consent of any Limited Partner, may take any action, including (i) causing the \nredemption, purchase or Transfer of any Limited Partner’s Interests in the Fund to Goldman Sachs, its affiliates or \none or more other Limited Partners or Eligible Investors, to the extent permitted by law, (ii) causing the forfeiture of \nany Limited Partner’s unvested Class O Interest or (iii) requiring the withdrawal of any Limited Partner, at a price \nequal to the then Fair Value of such Limited Partner’s Interest for payment in cash, in kind, by delivery of a note (or \nany combination of the foregoing), or, in the case of forfeiture, for no consideration and/or in exchange for a \nparticipation interest (or any combination of the foregoing) and on such other terms and conditions as the General \nPartner may determine, in each case, without regard to any applicable tax consequences (including consequences of \nTransfer) and (x) as the General Partner or Goldman Sachs in its discretion determines is necessary or advisable for \nGoldman Sachs or any of its affiliates to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations (including the BHCA or \nthe Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule) affecting the Fund, the Limited Partners, Goldman Sachs or any of \nits affiliates or (y) if the General Partner determines that the continued participation of the Limited Partner in the \nFund may cause the Fund, the General Partner or any of their respective affiliates to be (or remain) in violation of \nthe terms and conditions of the Application or any order approving the Application, or any U.S. federal or state law, \nrule or regulation, including SOX or the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule, or have an adverse effect on \nthe business or operations of Goldman Sachs, or otherwise raise tax, legal (including contractual restrictions) or \n34\nregulatory issues.  [           ]  By exercising any of its rights, or taking any of the actions described above, the General \nPartner may cause distributions in kind of non-marketable securities, forced sales of Interests by some or all Limited \nPartners (for notes or other consideration), or resignation of Goldman Sachs as the Investment Manager and/or the \nGeneral Partner.  Furthermore, the General Partner may exercise any such rights or authorized actions in its sole \ndiscretion and with respect to certain or all Limited Partners in a manner that may disproportionately affect some \nLimited Partners relative to other Limited Partners (even similarly situated Limited Partners) and the General Partner \nwill have no duty (implied or otherwise) to mitigate the effect on any Limited Partners or to treat any similarly \nsituated Limited Partners similarly.\n(m)\nThe General Partner may waive, on a case-by-case basis, its rights under this Section 8.7 \nto cause the Transfer or forfeiture of, convert and/or purchase Interests, [           ] and/or the retroactivity of any \nconversion or forfeiture.  In addition to any other rights described herein, the General Partner shall have the right to \ncause the redemption, purchase, Transfer or forfeiture of any Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect a \nLimited Partner.\n(n)\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Limited Partner or any \nRelated Employee any right to continued employment with Goldman Sachs or as affecting any right that Goldman \nSachs may have to terminate or alter the terms and conditions of any such Limited Partner’s or Related Employee’s \nemployment.\n(o)\n[           ]\n(p)\nAll references to the termination of employment with or departure from Goldman Sachs \nare deemed to occur immediately following any “garden leave” or similar notice period.\n(q)\n“Association with a Covered Enterprise” means that a Limited Partner or Related \nEmployee (i) forms, or acquires a 5% or greater equity ownership, voting or profit participation interest in, any \nCovered Enterprise or (ii) associates in any capacity (including association as an officer, employee, partner, director, \nconsultant, agent or advisor) with any Covered Enterprise.  “Association with a Covered Enterprise” may include, as \ndetermined in the discretion of Goldman Sachs, (i) becoming the subject of any publicly available announcement or \nreport of a pending or future association with a Covered Enterprise and (ii) unpaid associations, including an \nassociation in contemplation of future employment.\n(r)\n“Cause” means the Limited Partner’s (i) conviction, whether following trial or by plea of \nguilty or nolo contendere (or similar plea), in a criminal proceeding (A) on a misdemeanor charge involving fraud, \nfalse statements or misleading omissions, wrongful taking, embezzlement, bribery, forgery, counterfeiting or \nextortion or (B) on a felony charge or (C) on an equivalent charge to those in clauses (A) and (B) in jurisdictions \nwhich do not use those designations; (ii) engaging in any conduct which constitutes an employment disqualification \nunder applicable law (including statutory disqualification as defined under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of \n1934, as amended); (iii) willful failure to perform the Limited Partner’s duties to the Firm; (iv) violation of any \nsecurities or commodities laws, any rules or regulations issued pursuant to such laws, or the rules and regulations of \nany securities or commodities exchange or association of which the Firm is a member; (v) violation of any Firm \npolicy concerning hedging or pledging or confidential or proprietary information, or material violation of any other \nFirm policy as in effect from time to time; (vi) engaging in any act or making any statement which impairs, \nimpugns, denigrates, disparages or negatively reflects upon the name, reputation or business interests of the Firm, \nincluding any of its portfolio companies; or (vii) engaging in any conduct detrimental to the Firm, including any of \nits portfolio companies.

The liquidator shall not be liable to any Partner for any loss attributable to any act or omission of the \nliquidator taken in good faith on its part in connection with the liquidation of the Fund and the distribution of its \nassets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner has the right to liquidate the Fund, in the manner \ndescribed in this Section 9.2, at any time or as otherwise provided by operation of law.\n9.3.\nPotential Early Liquidation of Investments.

Any proposed transactions pursuant to this Section 9.3 will be effected only in accordance with the \nterms and conditions of the Application or any order approving the Application.  The Application permits such \ntransactions upon a determination by the General Partner that the terms of the transactions are fair and reasonable to \nthe investors in the Fund and do not involve overreaching of the Fund or its investors on the part of any person \nconcerned, and that the transactions are consistent with the interests of the investors in the Fund.  In making this \ndetermination, the General Partner may consider (1) the terms upon which Goldman Sachs or any Third Party Fund \nare participating in the transaction, (2) the consideration being paid or received by the Fund, (3) the methodology for \nallocating the investment / disposition opportunity among the Fund and the other participants in the transaction and \n(4) other factors that it deems relevant.  Each Limited Partner acknowledges that by entering into this Agreement, \nsuch Limited Partner consents to all such transactions in which Goldman Sachs or an affiliate acts as a principal on \nthe other side of a transaction with the Fund, provided that such transactions meet the requirements set forth in the \nApplication or any order approving the Application.\nArticle X\nBooks and Records; Accounting;\nValuation; Tax Matters and Elections\n10.1.\nBooks and Records.  The General Partner shall provide the Limited Partners with such access to \nthe books and records of the Fund and the General Partner as they are entitled under the Delaware Act, provided, \nhowever, that the General Partner may in its discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, withhold from such \nLimited Partners certain information to which they are otherwise entitled to receive.

The foregoing tax information may be prepared by internal staff of Goldman Sachs or by a \nnationally recognized accounting firm.  Whether internal staff of Goldman Sachs or an accounting firm prepares the \ntax information, the costs of preparation and delivery will be borne by the Fund.  The Fund does not expect that it \nwill provide a Schedule K-1 to the Limited Partners in advance of April 15th; therefore, each Limited Partner should \nbe prepared to file for an extension of the filing date for his, her or its U.S. federal income tax returns (and any \nrequired U.S. state, local, or non-U.S., tax returns).  Each Limited Partner will be responsible for the preparation and \nfiling of such Limited Partner’s own income tax returns.\n(b)\nThe General Partner will send to each Person who was a Limited Partner at the end of the \nfiscal year then ended financial statements of the Fund audited by the accountants, including the portfolio valuation \nas of that date.

As soon as \npracticable after the end of the Fund’s fiscal year (commencing with the first fiscal year during which the Fund \nmakes an investment), the General Partner will also send to each Person who was a Limited Partner at the end of \nsuch fiscal year a report of the investment activities of the Fund during that year.  Each Limited Partner \nacknowledges that the General Partner’s ability to provide Limited Partners with financial reports on the Fund \ndepends, in part, on the information the General Partner and the Investment Manager receive (directly or indirectly) \nfrom the Underlying Funds, when the General Partner or the Investment Manager receives such information and \nwhether the Underlying Funds agree to permit the Fund to provide such information to Limited Partners.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding clause (b) and anything else herein to the contrary, if a Limited Partner \nleaves Goldman Sachs (or, in the case of an Affiliated Investor Entity, the related Eligible Investor leaves Goldman \nSachs), then the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, withhold from that Limited Partner some of the \ninformation Limited Partners are otherwise entitled to receive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n10.5.\nTax Matters and Elections.\n(a)\nThe General Partner, or such eligible person as the General Partner may designate, shall \nbe designated as the “partnership representative” of the Fund within the meaning of Section 6223 of the Code and \nunder any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax law.  The Fund shall be entitled to appoint a “designated \nindividual” to the extent required or allowed by Treasury Regulations or other official guidance promulgated under \nor with respect to Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code and under any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. \ntax law (such partnership representative or designated individual, as applicable, the “Partnership Representative”).  \nThe Partnership Representative is specifically directed and authorized to take whatever steps the Partnership \nRepresentative deems necessary or desirable to perfect any such designation, including filing any forms or \ndocuments with the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and taking such other action as may from time to time be \nrequired under Treasury Regulations.  Each Limited Partner does hereby agree that, to the extent permitted by law, \n(i) the Partnership Representative will have the right to control all administrative and judicial proceedings in respect \nof tax matters of the Fund, and (ii) the Limited Partners will be bound by the outcome of final administrative \nadjustments resulting from an audit, as well as by the outcome of judicial review of adjustments.  Each Limited \nPartner further agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to file all tax returns that the Limited Partner is required to file \nin a manner consistent with the Fund’s tax returns and to waive his, her or its rights to participate in any \nadministrative or judicial proceedings with respect to the determination or allocation of the Fund’s taxable income.  \n41\nEach Limited Partner does hereby agree that any action taken by the General Partner in connection with audits of the \nFund under applicable tax law will be binding upon such Limited Partner.\n(b)\nThe General Partner or the Partnership Representative may, in its discretion, cause the \nFund to make or refrain from making all elections required or permitted to be made by the Fund under applicable tax \nlaw, including but not limited to an election to treat the Fund as an Electing Investment Partnership as defined in \nSection 743(e)(5) of the Code and an election under Section 754 of the Code.  The General Partner does not expect \nthat the Fund will make an election under Section 754 of the Code.  If the General Partner makes an election under \nSection 754 of the Code and it is required to adjust the tax basis of the Fund’s assets as a result thereof, or is \notherwise required to adjust the tax basis of the Fund’s assets under Section 734 or 743 of the Code, the General \nPartner shall endeavor to make such adjustments in good faith.\n(c)\nThe General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered to prepare or have prepared, to \nexecute or have executed and to file, on behalf of and in the name of the Fund, any returns, applications, agreements, \nelections and other instruments or documents, under applicable tax law, which it deems desirable or advisable.\n(d)\nIf the Fund receives a notice of final partnership adjustment from the IRS, the Partnership \nRepresentative may, as determined in its good faith discretion and with respect to any applicable year, cause the \nFund to (x) elect the application of Section 6226 of the Code with respect to any imputed underpayment arising from \nsuch adjustment, and (y) furnish to each Limited Partner (or former Limited Partner, as applicable) a statement of \nsuch Limited Partner’s (or former Limited Partner’s) share of any adjustment to income, gain, loss, deduction or \ncredit (as determined in the notice of final partnership adjustment).\n(e)\nEach Limited Partner further agrees that such Limited Partner will, upon request by the \nGeneral Partner or the Partnership Representative, execute any forms or documents (including a power of attorney \nor settlement or closing agreement), provide any information and take any further action requested by the General \nPartner or the Partnership Representative, and that the General Partner or the Partnership Representative may \nexecute any forms or documents or obtain any information on such Limited Partner’s behalf that relate to such \nLimited Partner’s investment in the Fund, in connection with any tax matter (including in connection with a tax \naudit or proceeding) affecting the Fund, including as reasonably necessary to effectuate any of the foregoing \nprovisions of this Section 10.5, including with respect to any forms, documents or information reasonably necessary \nfor the Fund to comply with FATCA or avoid being subject to withholding tax under FATCA.\n(f)\nIf a Limited Partner fails to comply with its obligations under this Section 10.5 or as \nrequired under the withholding rules related to transfers of Interests by non-U.S. persons and such failure results in \nany taxes, penalties, interest and/or any related costs or expenses (a “Tax Cost”), the General Partner shall, to the \nextent commercially practicable, cause such Limited Partner to bear the economic burden of such Tax Cost by \nspecially allocating the Tax Cost to such Limited Partner and/or withholding the Tax Cost from proceeds otherwise \ndistributable to such Limited Partner.

The Subscriber further understands that the Subscriber may be required, under the \ncircumstances described in the Offering Memorandum, to recontribute to the Fund all or a \nportion of any Carried Interest the Subscriber may have indirectly received from the Carried \nInterest Paying Funds. The Subscriber agrees that the Subscriber will recontribute these \namounts as and when required by the Fund.\n7.\nServices Required of Class O Interest Holders.

The Subscriber represents and warrants to the Fund and \nthe Authorized Person that:\n(a)\nThe Subscriber is purchasing the Interests for the Subscriber’s account for investment \npurposes only and not for distribution or resale to others. The Subscriber agrees that the \nSubscriber will not sell or otherwise transfer these securities unless they are registered \nunder the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or unless \nan exemption from registration is available therefrom.\n(b)\nThe Subscriber understands that the Interests are speculative investments that involve a \nhigh degree of risk of loss, has adequate means of providing for the Subscriber’s current \nneeds and possible personal contingencies, has no need for liquidity of this investment, \nand is financially able to withstand the loss of the Subscriber’s entire investment in the \nFund.\n(c)\nThe Subscriber will pay the Subscription Amount only from the Subscriber’s own funds \n(including, without limitation, in the case of an entity controlled by a GS Offeree, funds \ngifted or contributed to the Subscriber by the GS Offeree). The Subscriber understands \nthat investing funds provided by any person other than the GS Offeree is strictly \nprohibited.\n(d)\nThe Subscriber understands that the Subscriber has no right to require the purchase of \nthe Subscriber’s Interests; that the transferability of the Interests is severely limited and \nthat any transfer requires the consent of the Authorized Person, which may be withheld \nin its sole discretion; that there will be no public market for Interests and it will therefore \nnot be readily possible to sell or dispose of the Interests being acquired; and that the \nSubscriber will not be readily able to liquidate this investment.\n(e)\nThe Subscriber understands that the Interests have not been registered under the 1933 \nAct in reliance on the private placement exemption thereunder, and thus the Subscriber \nwill not be afforded the protections of registration under that act. Further, the Subscriber \nunderstands that Goldman Sachs has filed an application (together with any \namendments thereto, the “Application”) with the United States Securities and Exchange \nCommission (the “SEC”) seeking an order exempting the Fund, as an “employees’ \nsecurities company,” from most, but not all, of the provisions of the U.S. Investment \nCompany Act of 1940 (as amended, the “1940 Act”), including registration thereunder \nand certain prohibitions on transactions with Goldman Sachs. The Fund will rely on Rule \n6b-1 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to which the Fund will be exempt from the provisions \nof the 1940 Act, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Application (or any \norder of the SEC approving the Application). Thus, Subscribers of the Fund thus will not \nbe afforded most of the protections afforded by the 1940 Act. If an order approving the \nApplication is not obtained, the Fund will rely on the order dated August 14, 1998 \n(Release No. IC 23390), which was previously obtained from the SEC, to be exempt \nfrom the provisions of the 1940 Act, subject to the terms of that order.\n(f)\nThe Subscriber has carefully read and fully understands the Offering Memorandum, this \nSubscription Agreement and the Disqualified Person Disclosure, including, without \nlimitation, the risks of an investment set forth in the Offering Memorandum, and has \nbeen given the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms \nand conditions of the offering and other matters pertaining to an investment in the Fund.\nA-7\n(g)\nThe Subscriber has carefully read and fully understands the discussion of consequences \nof departure in the Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, the impact of a \nbreach by the GS Offeree or Subscriber of any provision of any agreement, arrangement \nor understanding with Goldman Sachs, and the impact of engaging in certain competitive \nactivities, or failing to provide certain certifications to Goldman Sachs, and understands \nthat, upon the occurrence of certain termination events described in the Offering \nMemorandum under the caption [   ] and in the Partnership Agreement, when available, \nas well as certain other events relating to the GS Offeree or Subscriber, (1) some or all \nof the Subscriber’s applicable Class A Interests will be subject to (i) conversion \n(including, without limitation, to a Class C Interest) and/or (ii) purchase or transfer, and/or \n(2) some or all of the Subscriber’s Class O Interests will be subject to forfeiture for no \nconsideration. If the Subscriber is an entity, the events of conversion, withdrawal, \nredemption, purchase or transfer described therein will be triggered by the associated \nemployee engaging in the conduct described therein.\nThe Subscriber understands that any such purchase, conversion, transfer or forfeiture of \nClass O Interests may have adverse economic and tax consequences. The method for \ndetermining the purchase price is more completely set forth in the Partnership \nAgreement.\n(h)\nIf the Subscriber is an entity, it understands that (i) it may be subject to special tax \nconsiderations not discussed in the Offering Memorandum, (ii) it has consulted with its \nown tax advisor as to all of the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences \nof an investment in the Fund and (iii) except as otherwise consented to by the General \nPartner, in the event of any direct or indirect Transfer of interests in, or any direct or \nindirect change in control of, any entity directly or indirectly investing in the Fund, the \nGeneral Partner may, but will be under no obligation to, cause the Fund to purchase or \ncause the Transfer or forfeiture of the Subscriber’s Interest.\n(i)\nIf the Subscriber is an entity, it is not, nor has it elected, nor will it elect under Treas. Reg. \n§ 301.7701-3 to be (i) treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes or (ii) treated as a “grantor trust” for U.S. federal income tax purposes under \nSections 671-674 of the Code. The Subscriber has full power and authority to execute \nand deliver the Subscription Agreement and to subscribe for and purchase the Interests \nin the manner provided herein. The execution and delivery of the Subscription \nAgreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the \nSubscriber and will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Subscriber, \nenforceable in accordance with their respective terms.\n(j)\nThe Subscriber, by signing the Subscriber Signature Page, hereby agrees that if the \nSubscriber ceases or expects to cease to be a “United States person” as defined in \nSection 7701(a)(30) of the Code, the Subscriber shall first provide prior written notice to \nthe General Partner of the change in the Subscriber’s status as a United States person \nat least 60 days prior to such change in status. The Subscriber agrees that, subject to \nthe conditions set forth in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner in its \ndiscretion may cause the Fund (i) to transfer the Subscriber’s interest in the Fund to \nanother United States person or (ii) to redeem the Subscriber’s interest in the Fund, in \neach case prior to such change in status.\n(k)\nThe Subscriber, by signing the Subscriber Signature Page, hereby agrees that in the \nevent that the Subscriber (i) does not fund any funding notices or capital calls duly made \nor make other contributions duly called pursuant to the partnership agreement (or other \nA-8\ngoverning documents) of any employee special investments in which the Subscriber \nowns an interest, including, without limitation, the Partnership Agreement and the Fund, \nor (ii) does not recontribute any amounts previously distributed as permitted by the \npartnership agreement (or other governing documents) of such investments, including, \nwithout limitation, the Partnership Agreement and the Fund, the Subscriber authorizes \nGoldman Sachs or any of its affiliates without further notice or presentment, to the extent \npermitted under applicable law, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code, to \ndeduct any or all amount(s) due from any or all of the following (each of which shall \ninclude any such amounts due, delivered or paid to the GS Offeree, if the Subscriber is \nan entity):\n(1)\nany amount due or to become due to the Subscriber in distributions from \ninvestments in which the Subscriber is invested under the Employee Special \nInvestments Program now or at any time in the future;\n(2)\nany stock deliveries made under the GS Stock Incentive Plan if otherwise \npermitted under the terms of the applicable award agreement;\n(3)\nany cash and/or any proceeds from the liquidation of any marketable securities, \nincluding, without limitation, Goldman Sachs stock, held in the Subscriber’s \nGoldman Sachs brokerage account(s) (including, without limitation, joint \naccounts);\n(4)\nany amounts paid to the Subscriber in connection with the Subscriber’s departure \nfrom Goldman Sachs, including, without limitation, severance payments; and\n(5)\nany amounts due to the Subscriber as T&E reimbursements.\n(l)\nThe Subscriber, by signing the Subscriber Signature Page, hereby authorizes the Fund \nto (i) withdraw funds allocated to the Subscriber’s capital account if necessary to satisfy \nany obligation owed by the Subscriber to Goldman Sachs, and (ii) to the extent such \nfunds are insufficient, cause the Subscriber’s Interest to be forfeited or reallocated.\n(m)\nThe Subscriber, by signing the Subscriber Signature Page, hereby agrees to provide to \nthe Fund any information, documentation, waiver, or certification that the Fund or the \nGeneral Partner may reasonably request or require in order to comply with applicable \nUnited States and non-United States laws, including tax laws.

By \nagreeing to acquire Interests pursuant to this offering, you are agreeing to fund all future capital calls as \nand when instructed via capital call notice from the Fund.\nClass A Interests\nClass A Interests will share in the profits and losses from the Fund’s investment activities and \noperations without being subject to a management fee or carried interest payable to Goldman Sachs at \nthe level of the Fund or the Underlying Funds, subject to the Class A Vesting Date described below.  \nClass A Interests will, however, indirectly bear management fees, carried interest and/or similar fees \nand expenses charged by Non-GS External Fund managers at the level of the Non-GS External Funds.  \nThe Class A Interests will not be entitled to the benefits, nor subject to the risks and detriments, of \nleverage. The holders of Class A Interests will be required to make capital contributions in respect of the \nClass A Interests for which they subscribe.\nClass A Interests are governed by the terms of the Partnership Agreement and the Offering \nMemorandum; provided, however, that contrary to the vesting dates set forth in the Partnership \nAgreement and the Offering Memorandum (as it relates to Class A Interests), any Class A Interests \nacquired pursuant to this offering will vest on December 31, [   ] (the “Class A Vesting Date”).  If an \nExecutive Participant’s Employment terminates, for any reason (whether due to voluntary or \ninvoluntary termination of employment), before the Class A Vesting Date, the General Partner \nwill have the right, but not the obligation, to (a) convert the Executive Participant’s Class A \nInterest to a Class C Interest, which, subject to applicable law, will be subject to the Class C \nAnnex B\nManagement Fee and Class C Carried Interest, or (b) cause the redemption, purchase or transfer \nof any Class A Interest or Class C Interest of such Executive Participant at a price equal to the \nMinimum Purchase Price.\n[           ]\nClass O Interests\nClass O Interests are entitled to share in a portion of any Carried Interest that may be earned in respect \nof the applicable Carried Interest Paying Funds subject to the return hurdles, notch amounts and other \nlimits described in the offering memorandum of each Carried Interest Paying Fund and/or the \nSupplement. If the return hurdles and notch amounts are achieved or exceeded as of [   ], the Class O \nInterests will only be entitled to share in a portion of any Carried Interest that may be earned in respect \nof the applicable Carried Interest Paying Fund to the extent that (i) the applicable Carried Interest \nPaying Fund’s limited partners have achieved or exceeded the return hurdle or notch amount described \nin the offering memorandum of each applicable Carried Interest Paying Fund (the “Original Hurdle”) and \n(ii) the aggregate realized and estimated value of the Carried Interest Paying Funds’ investments \n(calculated on the assumption that all unrealized investments were disposed of for their fair values \nimmediately prior to a distribution or measurement date for such Class O Interests) as a percentage of \nthe Carried Interest Paying Funds’ aggregate investment costs represents at least the applicable \npercentage as of [   ] (as finally determined by Goldman Sachs in accordance with its valuation \nprocedures) plus [   ]% (the “Class O Incremental Hurdle”). For the avoidance of doubt, because the \nClass O Interests may be subject to the Class O Incremental Hurdle, prior Class O Interests that are not \nsubject to an additional hurdle, or that are subject to a different additional hurdle, may have value while \nClass O Interests acquired pursuant to this offering have no value.\nTo the extent the Class O Incremental Hurdle is required, until the Class O Incremental Hurdle has \nbeen achieved, any Carried Interest associated with the Class O Interests shall be allocated to \nGoldman Sachs. Once the Class O Incremental Hurdle has been achieved, each holder of Class O \nInterests will be allocated, in respect of its Class O Interest, pro rata based on all Class O Interests, (i) \nthe Carried Interest associated with the applicable Class O Interest earned after that point and (ii) a \nportion of the Carried Interest held by Goldman Sachs, until the holders of Class O Interests have been \nallocated an amount of Carried Interest that they would have been allocated in the absence of the \nOriginal Hurdle, Class O Incremental Hurdle or any notch amount set forth in the Partnership \nAgreement (the amount described in clause (ii), the “Catch-up Amount”). Each holder of a Class O \nInterest will receive the Carried Interest associated with the applicable Class O Interest earned after \nholders of Class O Interests have received the Catch-up Amount in respect of their Class O Interests. \nThe foregoing may be applied at the level of a subsidiary of the Fund.\nAs a result of the mechanic described in the previous paragraph, in order for holders of Class O \nInterests to be allocated the entire Catch-up Amount, there must be sufficient gains (as determined for \nU.S. Federal income tax purposes) with respect to the Carried Interest allocated to the holders of Class \nO Interests and to Goldman Sachs after the Class O Incremental Hurdle has been achieved. If any Re-\nOffers are conducted, such gains would be allocated among additional holders of Carried Interest, and \nthe amounts allocated to holders of Class O Interests in respect of the Catch-up Amount may be \ndelayed or reduced (as compared to the amounts that would have been allocated if no Re-Offers had \noccurred). Moreover, if as of the termination of the applicable Carried Interest Paying Fund (or at such \nearlier time in the sole discretion of Goldman Sachs) both the Original Hurdle (if any) and the Class O \nIncremental Hurdle have not been satisfied, any Carried Interest that otherwise would have been \ndistributed to the holders of Class O Interests shall instead be distributed to Goldman Sachs.\nB-2\nUnder the circumstances described in [   ] of the Offering Memorandum, you may be required to re-\ncontribute to the Fund all or a portion of the Carried Interest that has been distributed to you (e.g., if the \nFund becomes obligated to re-contribute to the Carried Interest Paying Funds all or a portion of any \nCarried Interest previously received from the Carried Interest Paying Funds because the investors in \nthe Carried Interest Paying Funds have not received their priority return amount). By agreeing to \nacquire Interests pursuant to this offering, you are agreeing that you will re-contribute these amounts as \nand when required. Class O Interests are being granted for no consideration as the Class O Interests \nare currently estimated to have no value. [           ]\nHolders of Class O Interests should be aware that regulations under Section 1061 of the Internal \nRevenue Code that were finalized in 2021 could cause a recharacterization of Carried Interest, with the \neffect that a substantial portion of your income from the Funds may be treated as ordinary income for \nU.S. tax purposes.\nVesting\nContrary to the vesting dates set forth in the Offering Memorandum and the Partnership Agreement (as \nit relates to Class O Interests), any Class O Interests acquired pursuant to this offering will vest one-\nthird on December 31, [   ], an additional one-third on December 31, [   ] (for a total of two-thirds having \nvested as of such date, including the amount vested on December 31, [   ]) and the final one-third on \nDecember 31, [   ] (for a total of 100% having vested as of such date, including the amounts vested on \nDecember 31, [   ] and December 31, [   ]) (each date, a “Class O Vesting Date” and together, the \n“Class O Vesting Dates”). Except in the case of Retirement (as described below), a departure from \nGoldman Sachs (or any successors thereto) for any reason (whether due to voluntary or \ninvoluntary termination of employment) prior to the applicable Class O Vesting Date will result \nin the automatic forfeiture, for no consideration, of the unvested portion of your Class O \nInterests. These vesting provisions will apply irrespective of involuntary termination (including \ndue to downsizing) or death or adjudication of incompetence (i.e., vesting will not be \naccelerated for any reason). \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employment of an Executive Participant is terminated by \nRetirement, such Executive Participant’s Class O Interests will not be subject to forfeiture. Instead, such \nInterests that have not yet vested will vest according to the Class O Vesting Dates set forth above; \nprovided, however, that such Executive Participant’s rights to any Class O Interest that become \nvested by virtue of Retirement will terminate and such Executive Participant will have no further \nrights in respect of that Class O Interest following such Executive Participant’s Association with \na Covered Enterprise on or before the applicable Class O Vesting Date. Class O Interests will not \nbe eligible for continued vesting as described in the preceding sentence if: (i) such Executive \nParticipant or Goldman Sachs gives notice of termination, or such Executive Participant’s Employment \nterminates for any reason, prior to the date such Executive Participant would otherwise qualify for \nRetirement; (ii) such Executive Participant’s Employment terminates while Goldman Sachs is \nconsidering whether such Executive Participant engaged in conduct constituting Cause or after \nGoldman Sachs determines that such Executive Participant has engaged in conduct constituting \nCause; or (iii) such Executive Participant has Breached an Obligation to the Firm. Goldman Sachs will \ndetermine, in its sole discretion, whether the Executive Participant meets the eligibility criteria for \ncontinued vesting described in this paragraph, and the Interests to which continued vesting may apply. \nThe terms and conditions of an investment in the Fund applicable to an Executive Participant’s Interests \nwill remain in full force and effect; including, without limitation, provisions that provide for termination of \nsome or all of an Executive Participant’s rights such as redemption, transfer and/or forfeiture of vested \nClass O Interests, as well as the Additional Conditions Applicable to Class O Interests described below.\n[           ]\nB-3\nAdditional Conditions Applicable to Class O Interests\nNotwithstanding the terms of the Partnership Agreement and the Offering Memorandum, the conditions \nset forth below apply to an Executive Participant’s Class O Interests, in addition to any other terms or \nconditions that permit forfeiture, cancellation, conversion or liquidation of the Executive Participant’s \nInterests.\nCertain Forfeiture Events\nIf Goldman Sachs determines that an Executive Participant has engaged in one or more of the following \nevents, the General Partner will cause the forfeiture for no consideration of the Executive Participant’s \nClass O Interests (whether or not vested):\n•\nFails to Consider Risk,\n•\nconduct that constitutes Cause, \n•\nBreached an Obligation to the Firm,\n•\nEngages in Solicitation prior to the applicable Class O Vesting Date, or\n•\nAssociates with a Covered Enterprise prior to the applicable Class O Vesting Date.\nDeferral of Payment upon Occurrence of Certain Events\nIf Goldman Sachs determines that one or both of the following events occurs, the General Partner will \ndefer any distribution with respect to Class O Interests (other than tax distributions), without interest \nowing on any deferred amount, until the time as Goldman Sachs determines such event is no longer \noccurring:\n•\nGS Group’s ROE is anticipated or reported to be less than 5%; or \n•\nGS Group fails to maintain the required “Minimum Tier 1 Capital Ratio” as defined \nunder Federal Reserve Board Regulations applicable to GS Inc. for a period of 90 \nconsecutive business days.\n[Forfeiture and Repayment upon Accounting Restatement]\n[Class O Interests (whether or not vested) will be forfeited, and any amounts previously paid in respect \nof Class O Interests will be subject to repayment, if GS Group is required to prepare an account \nrestatement due to GS Group’s material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial \nreporting requirement under the securities laws as described in Section 304(a) of SOX; provided, \nhowever, that an Executive Participant’s Class O Interests will only be subject to forfeiture or repayment \nto the same extent that would be required under Section 304(a) of SOX had the Executive Participant \nbeen a “chief executive officer” or “chief financial officer” of GS Group (regardless of whether the \nExecutive Participant actually holds such position at the relevant time).]\nAdditional Consequences of Forfeiture\nUpon any forfeiture, you may be required, in Goldman Sachs’ sole discretion, to return any Class O \nInterest distributions previously received (even though you may have been taxed on income allocated in \nrespect of such Class O Interest and/or paid expenses incurred in connection with the formation and \nimplementation of any such carried interest arrangement). Subject to applicable law, forfeited Class O \nInterest shall be reallocated to Goldman Sachs (and therefore may be reallocated at a later date) and/or \nto new or existing Limited Partners. Any forfeited Class O Interest that is reallocated to new and/or \nexisting Limited Partners may be subject to a different vesting schedule (including a shorter or longer \nvesting schedule). Upon the forfeiture of all or a portion of your Class O Interests, you may be required, \nB-4\nin the Investment Manager’s sole discretion, to return any tax distribution amount previously distributed \nin respect of such forfeited Class O Interest.\nDefinitions\nAs used in this Supplement:\n“Association with a Covered Enterprise,” “Cause,” “Covered Enterprise,” “Engages in \nSolicitation,” Firm,” “Goldman Sachs,” “GS Group,” and “SOX” have the same meaning as set \nforth in the Partnership Agreement.\n“Breached an Obligation to the Firm” means that Goldman Sachs has determined, in its sole \ndiscretion, that an Executive Participant has failed to meet, in any respect, any obligation under \nany agreement with the Firm, or any agreement entered into in connection with the Executive \nParticipant’s Employment, including the Firm’s notice period requirements, applicable restrictive \ncovenants (such as restrictions on association with a Competitive Enterprise or Covered \nEnterprise, Engaging in Solicitation, and similar terms or concepts), any offer letter, employment \nagreement (e.g., Managing Director Agreement) or any shareholders’ agreement relating to \nGoldman Sachs.\n“Employment” means an Executive Participant’s employment by the Firm.\n“ROE” means the return on average common shareholders’ equity as calculated by the Firm.\n“Retirement” means termination of an Executive Participant’s Employment at a time when (i) (A) \nthe sum of the Executive Participant’s age plus years of service with the Firm equals or exceeds \n60 and (B) the Executive Participant has completed at least 10 years of service with the Firm or, \nif earlier, (ii) (A) the Executive Participant has attained age 50 and (B) the Executive Participant \nhas completed at least five years of service with the Firm; in each case, as determined by the \nFirm in its sole discretion.\nCertain U.K. Investors Only\nThe General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the forfeiture for no \nconsideration of some or all of the Class O Interest(s) of a U.K. investor who is considered a “Material \nRisk Taker”, if any of the following events occurs prior to the seventh anniversary of the issuance of the \napplicable Class O Interest(s) (which period may be extended by the General Partner in the event of \nany action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any of the following events is initiated by \nGoldman Sachs or a third party prior to the end of such seven-year period): \n(i) The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Investors Only\nIn accordance with Articles 1:126 and 1:127 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het \nfinancieel toezicht) in conjunction with Article 2:135 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), the \nboard of GSAM BV will have the obligation to cause the forfeiture of or to claw back, for no \nconsideration, some or all of the Class O Interest(s) of a Dutch investor who works under the \nresponsibility of GSAM BV (a “Dutch O Investor”), if any of the following events occurs prior to the fifth \nanniversary of the board of GSAM BV becoming aware of those events:\n(i) the Dutch O Investor has not met appropriate standards of competence and proper conduct; \nor\n(ii) the person was responsible for behaviours that have significantly deteriorated the financial \nposition of GSAM BV. \nIn addition, the board of GSAM BV will have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the forfeiture for \nno consideration of some or all of the Class O Interest(s) of a Dutch O Investor, if any of the following \nevents occurs prior to the fifth anniversary of the board of GSAM BV becoming aware of the event:\n(i) the award of the Class O Interest(s) to the Dutch O Investor would be unacceptable \naccording to standards of reasonableness and fairness.\nFinally, the board of GSAM BV will have the right, but not the obligation, to claw back for no \nconsideration some or all of the Class O Interest(s) of a Dutch O Investor, if the following event occurs \nprior to the fifth anniversary of the board of GSAM BV becoming aware of the event: \n(i) the Class O Interest(s) have been awarded on the basis of incorrect information about the \nachievement of the goals underlying the award or about the circumstances on which the \naward was dependent.\nProviding Information to the Appropriate Authorities and Protected Communications\nIn accordance with applicable law, nothing in the Fund Documentation (including the forfeiture, \nclawback and repayment provisions) prevents you from providing information you reasonably believe to \nbe true to the appropriate governmental authority, including a regulatory, judicial, administrative, or \nother governmental entity; reporting possible violations of law or regulation; making other disclosures \nthat are protected under any applicable law or regulation; or filing a charge or participating in any \ninvestigation or proceeding conducted by a governmental authority. For the avoidance of doubt, \ngovernmental authority includes Federal, state and local government agencies such as the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and any state \nor local human rights agency (e.g., the New York State Division of Human Rights, the New York City \nCommission on Human Rights, the California Civil Rights Department), as well as law enforcement \n(e.g., the state Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Justice). Similarly, nothing in the Fund \nDocumentation prohibits you from engaging in protected concerted activity pursuant to applicable law \nprotecting such activity, including discussing wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of your \nemployment; or speaking with your own attorney regarding your own legal rights or obligations. In \naddition, nothing in the Fund Documentation limits your ability to use the internal and external reporting \nB-7\nchannels that are available to you, as described in the Firmwide Policy on Escalation. “Fund \nDocumentation” means this Supplement, the Subscription Materials, the Subscription Agreement, the \nPartnership Agreement and the Offering Memorandum, as well as any other documentation presented \nto you in connection with the Fund.\nTax Considerations\nFor a general description of certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences and certain \nother tax considerations applicable to you of an investment in the Fund, including in respect of \nthe Class O Interests [           ].\nCertain Tax Implications – Funds\nThe Class O Interests are being granted for no consideration as such Class O Interests are currently \nestimated to have no value. [           ] As a result, you are not expected to be subject to U.S. federal \nincome taxes or to have a tax payment obligation in connection with acquiring interests pursuant to this \noffering. However, as valuation principles are inherently uncertain, the assets are illiquid and difficult to \nvalue, and timely information may not be readily available, there can be no assurance that the \nvaluations of the Interests assumed herein will not be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service \n(“IRS”), or that any such challenge would not be upheld. If the IRS determines that the fair market value \nof the Interests you are acquiring exceeds the amount you include in income, you will be required to \ninclude in income the excess. Accordingly, in agreeing to acquire Interests pursuant to this offering, you \nagree to accept the risk of incurring tax liability. Goldman Sachs cannot quantify the size of any such \npotential tax exposure. If a tax liability occurs, you may be required to make a tax payment to Goldman \nSachs for any applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld by, or otherwise paid \nby, Goldman Sachs in connection with the acquisition of the Interests.\nAs discussed above, in the event that the Class O Incremental Hurdle is established, until the Class O \nIncremental Hurdle has been achieved, any Carried Interest associated with the Class O Interests shall \nbe allocated to Goldman Sachs. Once the Class O Incremental Hurdle has been achieved, each holder \nof the Class O Interests will be allocated (i) allocations in respect of the Carried Interest earned after \nthat point and (ii) a portion of allocations in respect of the Carried Interest held by Goldman Sachs, until \nthe holders of Class O Interests have been allocated income equal to the amount of Carried Interest \nthat they would have been allocated in the absence of the Original Hurdle and the Class O Incremental \nHurdle (the amount described in clause (ii), the “Catch-up Amount”). Adverse consequences, including \nwith respect to character of income for tax purposes, may apply to the extent that distributions of \nCarried Interest to a holder of Class O Interests exceed the allocations described in the previous \nsentence. Each Class O Limited Partner should consult his or her own tax advisors with respect to the \ntax consequences of a Class O Incremental Hurdle and related mechanics.\nIf you are a non-U.S. investor, you should be prepared to be subject to similar rules and similar risks. \nThese taxes will generally depend upon the specific laws of your jurisdiction of tax residence, as well as \nthe values ascribed to the Interests by your applicable taxing authority. Accordingly, non-U.S. investors \nshould also carefully consider these consequences and risks. \nIf you are a U.K. investor and you would like to hold your Interests through a brokerage account \nseparate from the brokerage account through which you hold other employee fund interests, if \napplicable, please contact [   ].\nPotential Changes to Tax Laws and Regulations\nB-8\nEach Limited Partner should be aware that developments in the tax laws of the United States, or other \njurisdictions (including as a result of BEPS, ATAD, ATAD 2 and ATAD 3, and DAC6), could, directly or \nindirectly, have a material effect on the tax consequences to the Limited Partners and/or the Fund and \nthat a Limited Partner may be required to provide certain additional information to the Fund (which may \nbe provided to the IRS or other taxing authorities) or may be subject to other adverse consequences as \na result of such developments.  \nGoldman Sachs is both the owner of the Interests and the Investment Manager of the Funds. As \na result, Goldman Sachs may be in possession of certain non-public information regarding the \nFunds, assets owned by the Funds, and/or the fair market value of the Interests. Goldman Sachs \nis under no obligation to and may not affirmatively disclose such information. However, you \nmay discuss such information with the General Partner. Please contact the designated contact \nperson in the launch email with any questions.\nAn investment in the Fund will involve substantial risks and there are conflicts of interest. \n[           ]\nB-9\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

    "text": "Page 2 of 13\n1 \nSee the Firmwide Trading Policy for more information on transactions involving GS Equity Awards and for specific \nrestrictions, limitations and procedures, as well as reporting requirements, relating to the trading of GS Securities. If \nany provisions of this policy are inconsistent with the provisions of the Personal Trading Policy or the Firmwide \nTrading Policy, this policy shall govern. \nstate securities laws and this policy, no Firm Individual who is in possession of material nonpublic \ninformation related to the firm, may (i) trade in any GS Securities, or securities issued by another \ncompany, on the basis of material nonpublic information or (ii) “tip” any material nonpublic \ninformation to another person who may use such information to trade in GS Securities or such \nother company’s securities. \n2.\nMaterial Nonpublic Information\ni\nDetermining Materiality\nWhether a piece of information is material depends on the facts and circumstances in which it is \ncreated and distributed. \nInformation is typically deemed “material” if:\n•\nThere is substantial likelihood that it would be viewed by a reasonable investor as important in \nmaking an investment decision;\n•\nIts disclosure would be viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total \nmix of information otherwise available; or \n•\nIt is information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of a security.\nBoth favorable and unfavorable information can be material. However, there is no precise definition \nof “materiality,” and the question of whether information is material is subjective and may be \nquestioned in hindsight. Accordingly, Firm Individuals are advised to take a cautious view when \nevaluating whether information is “material.” Note that information may be considered material \neven if it relates to contingent, uncertain, or rumored events. Some examples of “material \ninformation” may include, depending on the particular circumstances:\n•\nPotential merger and acquisition activities;\n•\nPotential public offerings or other financings;\n•\nFinancial forecasts or projections;\n•\nSignificant changes in management; and\nSignificant product developments.
