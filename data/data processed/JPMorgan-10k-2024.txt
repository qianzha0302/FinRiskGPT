Item 1. Business.
Overview
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the 
“Firm”, NYSE: JPM), a financial holding company 
incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading 
financial services firm based in the United States of 
America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. 
JPMorganChase had $4.0 trillion in assets and $344.8 
billion in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2024. 
The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial 
services for consumers and small businesses, 
commercial banking, financial transaction processing 
and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and 
Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers, 
predominantly in the U.S., and many of the world’s 
most prominent corporate, institutional and 
government clients globally.
JPMorganChase’s principal bank subsidiary is 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association 
(“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national banking 
association with U.S. branches in 48 states and 
Washington, D.C. JPMorganChase’s principal non-
bank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. 
Morgan Securities”), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank 
and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorganChase operate 
nationally as well as through overseas branches and 
subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary 
foreign banks. The Firm’s principal operating 
subsidiaries outside the U.S. are J.P. Morgan Securities 
plc and J.P. Morgan SE (“JPMSE”), which are 
subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and are 
based in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Germany, 
respectively.
The Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com. 
JPMorganChase makes available on its website, free of 
charge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports 
on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K 
pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as 
reasonably practicable after it electronically files or 
furnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov. 
JPMorganChase makes new and important 
information about the Firm available on its website at 
https://www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the 
Investor Relations section of its website at https://
www.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on the Firm's 
website, including documents on the website that are 
referenced in this Form 10-K, is not incorporated by 
reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K” or 
“Form 10-K”) or the Firm’s other filings with the SEC. 
Business segments & Corporate
Effective in the second quarter of 2024, 
JPMorganChase reorganized its reportable business 
segments by combining the former Corporate & 
Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business 
segments to form one reportable segment, the 
Commercial & Investment Bank. As a result of the 
reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business 
segments – Consumer & Community Banking (“CCB”), 
Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”) and Asset & 
Wealth Management (“AWM”) – with the remaining 
activities in Corporate. The Firm’s consumer business 
segment is CCB, and the Firm’s wholesale business 
segments are CIB and AWM.
A description of the Firm’s reportable business 
segments and the products and services that they 
provide to their respective client bases, as well as a 
description of Corporate activities, is provided in the 
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial 
condition and results of operations section of this 
Form 10-K (“Management’s discussion and analysis” or 
“MD&A”) under the heading “Business Segment & 
Corporate Results,” which begins on page 52, and in 
Note 32. 
Competition
JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries and affiliates 
operate in highly competitive environments. 
Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, 
investment banking companies, merchant banks, 
hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private 
equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund 
companies, investment managers, credit card 
companies, mortgage banking companies, trust 
companies, securities processing companies, 
automobile financing companies, leasing companies, 
e-commerce and other internet-based companies, 
financial technology companies, and other companies 
engaged in providing similar and new products and 
services. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on 
the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s 
products and services, transaction execution, 
innovation, reputation and price. Competition also 
varies based on the types of clients, customers, 
industries and geographies served. With respect to 
some of its geographies and products, 
JPMorganChase competes globally; with respect to 
others, the Firm competes on a national or regional 
basis. New competitors in the financial services 
industry continue to emerge, including firms that offer 
products and services solely through the internet and 
non-financial companies that offer products and 
services that disintermediate traditional banking 
products and services offered by financial services 
firms such as JPMorganChase.
Part I
1
Supervision and regulation
The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive 
regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as 
the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
in which the Firm does business.  
Financial holding company:
Consolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a 
bank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding 
company (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject 
to comprehensive consolidated supervision, 
regulation and examination by the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). 
The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the 
consolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of 
JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated 
directly by additional authorities based on the 
activities or licenses of those subsidiaries.
JPMorganChase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, 
with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
JPMorganChase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised 
and regulated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the 
Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-
related activities are supervised and regulated by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). 
J.P. Morgan Securities plc holds a banking license in 
the U.K. and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential 
Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial 
Conduct Authority (“FCA”). 
JPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution jointly 
regulated by the European Central Bank (“ECB”), the 
German Financial Supervisory Authority and the 
German Central Bank, as well as the local regulators in 
each of the countries in which it operates. The Firm’s 
other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the 
banking, securities, prudential, payments and conduct 
regulatory authorities, as applicable, in the countries in 
which they operate. 
Permissible business activities. The Bank Holding 
Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in 
business activities other than the business of banking 
and certain closely-related activities. FHCs are 
permitted to engage in a broader range of financial 
activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to 
limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible 
activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution 
subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility 
requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose 
corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on 
the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require 
divestiture of the FHC’s depository institutions. If any 
depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to 
maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community 
Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit 
the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new 
activities other than those permissible for BHCs, or 
acquiring a company engaged in such activities. 
Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal 
Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage 
requirements for JPMorganChase that are generally 
consistent with the international Basel III capital and 
liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s 
compliance with those requirements. The OCC 
establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries 
and branches are also subject to local capital and 
liquidity requirements.
Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and 
enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial 
institutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators 
released a proposal to amend the U.S. risk-based 
capital framework to incorporate certain elements of 
the revised international Basel III capital framework. 
The proposal would significantly revise risk-based 
capital requirements for banks with assets of $100 
billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global 
systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). Finalization of 
the proposal, including the required implementation 
date, is uncertain. The Firm continues to monitor 
developments and potential impacts.
In the EU and U.K., regulators have finalized the rules 
implementing their Basel III frameworks. The new rules 
became effective in the EU beginning January 1, 2025, 
with market risk aspects delayed until January 1, 2026. 
In January 2025, the PRA announced that it intends to 
delay the implementation of the new rules in the U.K. to 
January 1, 2027. There are certain transitional 
arrangements applicable in both the EU and U.K. until 
2032 and 2030, respectively.
Stress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorganChase is 
subject to supervisory stress testing administered by 
the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s 
annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual 
company-run stress tests and must also submit an 
annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into 
account the results of separate stress tests designed 
by each of the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The 
Federal Reserve uses the results under the severely 
adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to 
determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) 
requirement for the coming year, which forms part of 
the Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is 
required to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 
2025. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its 
indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2025 and final 
SCB requirement by August 31, 2025. The Firm’s final 
Part I
2
SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 
2025. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to 
perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The 
Firm publishes each year the results of the annual 
stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse” 
scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the 
OCC. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve 
indicated in a press release that it intends to seek 
public comment on changes to its stress testing 
framework. Additionally, there is a pending legal 
challenge to the manner in which stress testing is 
administered. Refer to Litigation and regulatory 
challenges on pages 6-7 for further information.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 
and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for 
more information.
Enhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate 
to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of 
the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) 
recommends prudential standards and reporting 
requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically 
important financial institutions (“SIFIs”), such as 
JPMorganChase. The Federal Reserve has adopted 
several rules to implement those heightened 
prudential standards, including rules relating to risk 
management and corporate governance of subject 
BHCs. JPMorganChase is required under these rules to 
comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk 
management standards, including oversight by the 
board of directors of risk management activities.
Holding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. is required to serve as a source of 
financial strength for its depository institution 
subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those 
subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the 
Federal Reserve. 
Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and 
their banks are subject to requirements, limitations 
and prohibitions established by law and by the Federal 
Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs 
are required to obtain the approval of the Federal 
Reserve before they acquire more than 5% of the 
voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, 
acquisitions by financial companies are generally 
prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total 
liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% 
of the total liabilities of all financial companies, as 
determined under Federal Reserve regulations. 
Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must 
provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to 
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any 
voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in 
assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in 
nature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a 
broader range of activities (including acquisitions) 
than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to 
limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible 
acquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository 
institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable 
eligibility requirements.
Ongoing obligations. The Firm is subject to a five-year 
cooperation obligation under an order issued by the 
CFTC on September 29, 2020, relating to precious 
metals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations. The 
Firm also remains subject to consent orders entered 
into in March 2024 with the OCC and the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and a 
resolution entered into in May 2024 with the CFTC, 
which relate to the Firm’s processes to inventory 
trading venues and confirm the completeness of 
certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms.
Subsidiary banks: 
The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s 
principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those 
specifically authorized under the National Bank Act 
and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has 
authority to bring an enforcement action against 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound 
banking practices, which could include limiting 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct 
otherwise permissible activities, or imposing 
corrective capital or managerial requirements on the 
bank.
FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance 
fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits 
and is funded through assessments on banks, 
including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The FDIC is 
required to maintain a minimum reserve ratio, which 
measures the balance of reserves in the deposit 
insurance fund against an estimate of FDIC-insured 
deposits, of 1.35%. The reserve ratio is currently below 
the statutory minimum and, in October 2022, the FDIC 
adopted a final rule to raise bank assessments and 
accelerate the time by which the reserve ratio would 
meet the statutory minimum. As a result, the FDIC has 
adopted a restoration plan to bring the reserve ratio up 
to the required 1.35% by September 30, 2028, with a 
longer-term target of maintaining a reserve ratio of 2%.
FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any 
insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC 
could be appointed as conservator or receiver under 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad 
powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the 
approval of the institution’s creditors.  
Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take 
“prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository 
institution if that institution does not meet certain 
3
capital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is 
also authorized to take appropriate action against the 
parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on 
the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In 
certain instances, the BHC would be required to 
guarantee the performance of the capital restoration 
plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. 
Heightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S., the 
OCC has established guidelines setting forth 
heightened standards for large banks, including 
minimum standards for the design and 
implementation of a risk governance framework for 
banks. Under these standards, a bank’s risk 
governance framework must ensure that the bank’s 
risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from 
that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. 
The bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for 
approving the bank’s risk governance framework, 
providing active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking 
activities, and holding management accountable for 
adhering to the risk governance framework.
The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. are 
subject to supervisory expectations published by the 
ECB and the PRA, respectively, addressing bank 
strategy, governance and risk management in the 
areas of climate change, operational resilience, 
reliance on IT systems and third-party services, and 
resilience from macro-financial and geopolitical 
shocks. 
Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to 
restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of 
credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and 
derivatives, securities lending and certain other 
transactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain 
other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries unless 
the loans are secured in specified amounts and 
comply with certain other requirements. 
Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations 
on the payment of dividends by national banks, such 
as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the 
amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
could pay, at January 1, 2025, to JPMorganChase 
without the approval of the banking regulators. The 
OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to 
prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank 
subsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking 
regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would 
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the 
financial condition of the bank. 
Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of 
a receiver of an insured depositary institution (“IDI”) for 
administrative expense and the claims of holders of 
U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits 
in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. 
and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims 
of other unsecured creditors of the institution, 
including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public 
noteholders. 
Consumer supervision and regulation. 
JPMorganChase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are 
subject to supervision and regulation in the U.S. by the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with 
respect to federal consumer protection laws, including 
laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of 
unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in 
connection with the offer, sale or provision of 
consumer financial products and services. The CFPB 
also has jurisdiction over small business lending 
activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory 
oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement 
actions against firms that offer certain products and 
services to consumers using practices that are 
deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In March 
2024, the CFPB released a final rule which significantly 
reduces the late payment fees that large credit card 
issuers, including the Firm, are permitted to charge to 
customers (the “CFPB Late Fee Rule”). The final rule is 
currently stayed pending resolution of an industry-led 
challenge in federal court. Refer to Litigation and 
regulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for further 
information.
In addition, in October 2024, the CFPB issued a final 
rule that requires data providers, including banks, to 
make certain consumer data available to consumers 
and authorized third parties in electronic form 
beginning in April 2026 (the “CFPB Data Sharing 
Rule”). Refer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on 
pages 6-7 for further information.
Separately, in December 2024, the CFPB announced a 
final rule that would significantly restrict overdraft fees 
for certain insured depository institutions, including 
the Firm (the “CFPB Overdraft Rule”). The rule imposes 
certain requirements on overdraft protections that are 
similar to those that apply to credit cards, unless the 
institution prices the overdraft fee at $5 per 
transaction or the institution’s cost as outlined by the 
CFPB. Refer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on 
pages 6-7 for further information. 
In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board proposed 
to lower the maximum interchange fee that large debit 
card issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to 
receive for a debit card transaction. The proposal 
would also establish a process for automatically 
publishing an updated maximum fee amount every 
other year going forward. The Firm’s consumer 
activities are also subject to regulation under state 
Part I
4
statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or 
empowered agency of each state.
In the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P. 
Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides retail 
investment management services through Nutmeg 
Saving and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is 
regulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg 
are regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct 
of financial services in the U.K., including obligations 
relating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is 
also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator 
with respect to its operation and use of payment 
systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL 
and Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection 
legislation. 
Securities and broker-dealer regulation: 
The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing 
and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-
dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to 
regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock 
Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar 
securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local 
regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities 
are primarily conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc 
and in the EU, those activities are primarily conducted 
by JPMSE. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and 
regulations covering all aspects of the securities 
business, including sales and trading practices, 
securities offerings, publication of research reports, 
use of customer funds, the financing of client 
purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and 
retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers 
and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory 
capital on page 107 for information concerning the 
capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan 
Securities plc and JPMSE. In addition, the Firm's sales 
and trading activities, which are conducted through 
both bank and non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to 
laws and regulations relating to market conduct, 
including prohibitions on manipulative or anti-
competitive practices.
Investment management regulation: 
The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses 
are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions 
around the world relating to, among other things, the 
safeguarding and management of client assets, 
offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of 
the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and subject 
to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and 
broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered investment 
advisers in the U.S. are subject to the fiduciary and 
other obligations imposed under the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state and federal 
law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities are subject to 
supervision by the OCC. 
The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses 
continue to be subject to ongoing rule-making and 
implementation of new regulations and other 
guidance, including by the SEC and certain U.S. states 
with respect to enhanced standards of conduct and 
conflicts of interest. In April 2024, the Department of 
Labor (“DOL”) finalized a new “fiduciary” rule that 
would significantly expand the scope for defining who 
can be deemed investment advice fiduciaries for 
purposes of retirement plans and individual retirement 
accounts (“IRAs”) under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (the 
“Fiduciary Rule”). Among the most significant impacts 
of the rule and related amendments to prohibited 
transaction exemptions would be the impact on the fee 
and compensation practices at financial institutions 
that offer investment recommendations to retirement 
clients, including in the context of rollovers from an 
employer plan to an IRA. The effective date of the 
Fiduciary Rule has been stayed by two federal courts. 
Refer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on pages 
6-7 for further information. 
Derivatives regulation: 
The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its 
derivatives businesses. In the U.S., JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan 
Securities plc are registered with the CFTC as “swap 
dealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC 
as “security-based swap dealers”. As a result, these 
entities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory 
framework applicable to their swap or security-based 
swap activities, including capital requirements, rules 
requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and 
security-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of 
counterparty collateral, business conduct and 
documentation standards, rules requiring the central 
clearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) 
derivatives, requirements that certain standardized 
OTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, 
record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-
fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar 
requirements have also been established in the 
European Union (“EU”) under the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as well as 
in the U.K. and other jurisdictions around the world. 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the 
CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a 
member of the National Futures Association. 
Data, privacy, cybersecurity and artificial 
intelligence regulation: 
The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules 
and regulations globally concerning data, including 
data protection, consumer protection, privacy, 
cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and related 
5
matters. These laws, rules and regulations are 
constantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a 
focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by 
private parties or government bodies, and continue to 
have a significant impact on all of the Firm’s 
businesses and operations.
For example, the Digital Operational Resilience Act 
(DORA) mandates that the Firm’s financial services 
subsidiaries operating in the EU comply with 
requirements relating to information and 
communications technology (“ICT”) risk management, 
reporting, security control testing and ICT third party 
risks beginning in January 2025. In addition, the EU 
Artificial Intelligence Act regulates the development 
and deployment of artificial intelligence systems within 
the EU, with phased-in requirements that began in 
February 2025.
The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: 
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial 
institutions, including banks and securities broker-
dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal 
controls reasonably designed to prevent money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA 
includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting 
requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-
customer documentation requirements. The Firm is 
also subject to the regulations and economic 
sanctions programs administered and enforced by the 
U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(“OFAC”) and EU and U.K. authorities which target 
entities or individuals that are, or are located in 
countries that are, involved in activities including 
terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights 
violations. The Firm is also subject to economic 
sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other 
jurisdictions in which it operates, including those that 
conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorganChase 
from complying with certain laws, rules and 
regulations to which it is otherwise subject.
Anti-Corruption: 
The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to 
corrupt and illegal payments to government officials 
and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, 
including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and 
the U.K. Bribery Act.
Compensation practices: 
The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to 
oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other 
agencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued 
guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed 
to ensure that incentive compensation paid by 
banking organizations does not encourage imprudent 
risk-taking that threatens the organizations’ safety and 
soundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has 
also established standards covering compensation 
principles for banks. The Firm’s compensation 
practices are also subject to regulation and oversight 
by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth 
Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as 
implemented in the EU and as largely adopted in the 
U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. 
The European Banking Authority has instituted 
guidelines on compensation policies including under 
CRD V which in certain countries (such as Germany) 
are implemented or supplemented by local regulations 
or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted 
regulations and guidelines on compensation policies, 
which diverge in certain areas from EU rules. The Firm 
expects that the implementation of regulatory 
guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and 
other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect 
the manner in which the Firm structures its 
compensation programs and practices.
Sustainability:
Policymakers in the U.K. and the EU have continued to 
implement and enhance sustainability-related 
initiatives and disclosure requirements. The Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will replace 
and significantly expand the scope and content of 
certain EU ESG reporting requirements, with phased-
in requirements expected to start with fiscal year 
2024. The implementation of CSRD into local law has 
been delayed in a number of member states, including 
in Germany, and the Firm continues to monitor 
developments and potential impacts. In addition, in 
July 2024, the EU enacted the Corporate Sustainability 
Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”), which provides for 
phased-in requirements starting in 2027. The CSDDD 
sets mandatory due diligence obligations for 
companies to address actual and potential human 
rights violations and environmental adverse impacts 
stemming from their own operations and business 
relationships, including the activities of certain 
companies with which they have established business 
relationships and also requires the adoption of 
company-specific climate-related transition plans. 
Both the CSRD and CSDDD will impact certain of the 
Firm’s EU and non-EU entities.
Litigation and regulatory challenges:
Trade organizations representing the financial 
services industry and others have filed lawsuits 
challenging various laws, rules and regulations that, if 
enacted, adopted or implemented, could have 
significant adverse impacts on the results of 
operations or compliance costs of financial 
institutions, including the Firm. These matters include:
• Stress tests: The Bank Policy Institute (“BPI”), the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other trade 
organizations filed an action against the Federal 
Reserve in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Ohio in December 2024 
challenging the manner in which the annual stress 
testing process is administered.
Part I

• CFPB Late Fee Rule: This rule has been stayed 
pending resolution of an action challenging the rule 
filed against the CFPB in the United States District 
Court for the Northern District of Texas in March 
2024 by trade organizations including the American 
Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers 
Association.
• CFPB Data Sharing Rule: The BPI, the Kentucky 
Bankers Association and other organizations filed an 
action against the CFPB in the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in October 
2024 challenging key aspects of this rule.
• CFPB Overdraft Rule: An action filed by trade 
organizations led by the Mississippi Bankers 
Association against the CFPB in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi 
in December 2024 seeks a preliminary injunction to 
stay the October 1, 2025 effective date of this rule. 
The CFPB has consented in part to stay the effective 
date of the rule by 90 days and to temporarily stay 
the litigation. The preliminary injunction and the stay 
of litigation are pending court approval.
• Fiduciary Rule: Trade organizations including the 
Federation of Americans for Consumer Choice and 
the American Council of Life Insurers filed actions 
against the DOL seeking to enjoin this rule, and in 
July 2024, the effective date of the rule was stayed 
by two United States District Courts.

Attracting and retaining employees
The goal of JPMorganChase’s recruitment efforts is to 
attract and hire highly qualified candidates in all roles 
and at all career levels. The Firm’s hiring practices 
focus on the skills and qualifications of a candidate 
relative to the job requirements.
The Firm strives to provide both external candidates 
and internal employees who are seeking a different 
role with challenging and stimulating career 
opportunities. These opportunities range from 
internship training programs for students to entry-
level, management and executive careers. During 
2024, approximately 56% of the Firm’s employment 
opportunities were filled by external candidates, with 
the remainder filled by existing employees. 
Developing employees
JPMorganChase supports the professional 
development and career growth of its employees. The 
Firm requires that its employees, including new hires,

other topics, compliance with the Firm’s Code of 
Conduct and information concerning Firm policies and 
standards, including those relating to cybersecurity. In 
addition, the Firm offers extensive voluntary training 
programs and educational resources to all employees 
covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership 
and management, artificial intelligence, data literacy

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
The following discussion sets forth the material risk 
factors that could affect JPMorganChase’s financial 
condition and operations. Readers should not consider 
any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set 
of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of 
the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or 
combined with other factors, materially and adversely 
affect JPMorganChase’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition, capital position, 
liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including 
by materially increasing expenses or decreasing 
revenues, which could result in material losses or a 
decrease in earnings.
Summary
The principal risk factors that could adversely affect 
JPMorganChase’s business, results of operations, 
financial condition, capital position, liquidity, 
competitive position or reputation include:
• Regulatory risks, including the impact that 
applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-
regulated and supervised financial services industry, 
as well as changes to or in the application, 
interpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules 
and regulations, can have on JPMorganChase’s 
business and operations, including JPMorganChase 
incurring additional costs associated with 
assessments, levies or other governmental charges; 
the ways in which differences in financial services 
regulation and supervision in different jurisdictions 
or with respect to certain competitors can negatively 
impact JPMorganChase’s business; the ways in 
which governmental policies that discourage or 
penalize business relationships with clients in 
certain industries, or require specific business 
practices, can negatively affect JPMorganChase's 
businesses; the penalties and collateral 
consequences, and higher compliance and 
operational costs, that JPMorganChase may incur 
when resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways 
in which less predictable legal and regulatory 
frameworks in certain jurisdictions can negatively 
impact JPMorganChase’s operations and financial 
results; and the losses that security holders and 
other unsecured creditors will absorb if 
JPMorganChase were to enter into a resolution.
• Political risks, including the potential negative 
effects on JPMorganChase’s businesses due to 
economic uncertainty or instability caused by 
political developments.
• Market risks, including the effects that economic 
and market events and conditions, political 
developments, changes in interest rates and credit 
spreads, and market fluctuations can have on 
JPMorganChase’s consumer and wholesale 
businesses and its investment and market-making 
positions and on JPMorganChase’s earnings and its 
liquidity and capital levels.
• Credit risks, including potential negative effects 
from adverse changes in the financial condition of 
clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and 
central counterparties; the potential for losses due to 
declines in the value of collateral in stressed market 
conditions; and potential negative impacts from 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to clients, 
customers, counterparties and other market 
participants.
• Liquidity risks, including the risk that 
JPMorganChase’s liquidity could be impaired by 
market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen 
liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell 
assets, default by a significant market participant, 
unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack 
of market or customer confidence in 
JPMorganChase; the dependence of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; and 
the potential adverse effects that any downgrade in 
any of JPMorganChase’s credit ratings may have on 
its liquidity and cost of funding.
• Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or 
inability of JPMorganChase to maintain the required 
level and composition of capital, or unfavorable 
changes in applicable capital requirements, could 
limit JPMorganChase’s ability to distribute capital to 
shareholders or to support its business activities.
• Operational risks, including risks associated with 
JPMorganChase’s dependence on its operational 
systems and its employees, as well as the systems 
and employees of third parties, market participants 
and service providers; the potential negative effects 
of failing to identify and address operational risks 
related to the failure of internal or external 
operational systems, the introduction of or changes 
to products, services and delivery platforms or the 
adoption of new technologies; risks related to 
safeguarding personal information; the harm that 
could be caused by a successful cyber attack 
affecting JPMorganChase or by other extraordinary 
events; risks associated with JPMorganChase’s risk 
management framework and control environment,

judgments used in its stress testing and financial 
statements, and controls over disclosure and 
financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of 
failing to comply with applicable standards for the 
oversight of vendors and other service providers.

JPMorganChase’s competitive standing and results 
that could occur if management fails to develop and 
execute effective business strategies; risks 
associated with the significant and increasing 
competition that JPMorganChase faces; and the 
potential adverse impacts of climate change on the 
Part I
10
effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s existing business 
strategies with respect to its operations, clients and 
customers.
• Conduct risks, including the negative impact that 
can result from the actions or misconduct of 
employees, including any failure of employees to 
conduct themselves in accordance with 
JPMorganChase’s expectations, policies and 
practices.
• Reputation risks, including the potential adverse 
effects on JPMorganChase’s relationships with its 
clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders that could arise from employee 
misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk 
management, compliance or operational failures, 
litigation and regulatory investigations, failure to 
satisfy expectations concerning environmental, 
social and governance concerns, failure to 
effectively manage conflicts of interest or to satisfy 
fiduciary obligations, or other factors that could 
damage JPMorganChase’s reputation.
• Country risks, including potential impacts on 
JPMorganChase’s businesses from an outbreak or 
escalation of hostilities between countries or within a 
country or region; and the potential adverse effects 
of local economic, political, regulatory and social 
factors on JPMorganChase’s business and revenues 
in certain countries in which it operates.
• People risks, including the criticality of attracting 
and retaining qualified employees; and the potential 
adverse effects of unfavorable changes in 
immigration or travel policies on JPMorganChase’s 
workforce.
• Legal risks, including those relating to litigation and 
regulatory and government investigations.
The above summary is subject in its entirety to the 
discussion of the risk factors set forth below.
Regulatory
JPMorganChase’s businesses are highly regulated, 
and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to 
JPMorganChase have a significant impact on its 
business and operations.
JPMorganChase is a financial services firm with 
operations worldwide. JPMorganChase must comply 
with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its 
operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in 
which it does business, and financial services firms 
such as JPMorganChase are subject to extensive and 
constantly-evolving regulation and supervision.
The regulation and supervision of JPMorganChase 
significantly affects the way that it conducts its 
business and structures its operations, and 
JPMorganChase could be required to make changes to 
its business and operations in response to supervisory 
expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, 
rules and regulations. These types of developments 
could result in JPMorganChase incurring additional 
costs or experiencing a reduction in revenues to 
comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, 
which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, 
JPMorganChase’s entry into or acquisition of a new 
business or an increase in its principal investments 
may require JPMorganChase to comply with additional 
laws, rules, and regulations.
Additionally, JPMorganChase’s ability to execute 
certain business initiatives could become more 
challenging due to increased regulation in the financial 
services industry, such as limitations on late payment, 
overdraft and interchange fees. This could adversely 
affect JPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer 
businesses, prompting the reevaluation or adjustment 
of certain businesses or product offerings, as well as 
the reallocation of resources and incurrence of 
restructuring costs, which could impact revenue and 
profitability in the affected lines of business.
In response to new and existing laws, rules and 
regulations and expanded supervision, 
JPMorganChase has in the past been and could in the 
future be, required to:
• limit the products and services that it offers
• reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its 
market-making activities
• refrain from engaging in business opportunities that 
it might otherwise pursue
• pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum 
global tax regime), assessments, levies or other 
governmental charges, including in connection with 
the resolution of tax examinations
• incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent 
transactions perpetrated against its customers
• dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or 
prices that are disadvantageous
• impose restrictions on certain business activities, or
• increase the prices that it charges for products and 
services, which could reduce the demand for them.
Any failure by JPMorganChase to comply with the 
laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could 
result in:
• increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny
• regulatory and governmental enforcement actions
• the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions
• increased exposure to litigation, or
• harm to its reputation.
11
Differences and inconsistencies in financial services 
regulation and supervision can negatively impact 
JPMorganChase’s businesses, operations and 
financial results.
The content and application of laws, rules and 
regulations affecting financial services firms can vary 
according to factors such as the size of the firm, the 
jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and 
other criteria. For example:
• larger firms such as JPMorganChase are often 
subject to more stringent supervision, regulation 
and regulatory scrutiny
• financial technology companies and other non-
traditional competitors may not be subject to 
banking regulation, or may be supervised by a 
national or state regulatory agency that does not 
have the same resources or regulatory priorities as 
the regulatory agencies that supervise more 
diversified financial services firms, or 
• the financial services regulatory and supervisory 
framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor 
financial institutions that are based in that 
jurisdiction.
These types of differences in the regulatory and 
supervisory framework can result in JPMorganChase 
losing market share to competitors that are less 
regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with 
respect to unregulated financial products.
There can also be significant differences in the ways 
that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial 
services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in 
other countries and regions in which JPMorganChase 
does business. For example, when adopting rules that 
are intended to implement a global regulatory or 
supervisory standard, a national regulator may 
introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, 
which can create competitive disadvantages for 
financial services firms, such as JPMorganChase, that 
may be subject to those enhanced regulations.
In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies 
and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have 
adopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict 
with or prohibit JPMorganChase from complying with 
laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise 
subject, creating conflict of law issues that also 
increase its risk of non-compliance in those 
jurisdictions.
Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. 
have required and could in the future require 
JPMorganChase to make significant modifications to 
its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant 
countries or regions in order to comply with those 
requirements. These include laws, rules and 
regulations that have been adopted or proposed, as 
well as regulatory expectations, relating to:
• the establishment of locally-based intermediate 
holding companies or operating subsidiaries
• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of 
capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries
• the implementation of processes within locally-
based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory 
requirements or expectations
• the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking 
products and services from markets activities
• requirements for the orderly resolution of financial 
institutions
• requirements for executing or settling transactions 
on exchanges or through central counterparties 
(“CCPs”), or for depositing funds with other financial 
institutions or clearing and settlement systems
• position limits and reporting rules for derivatives
• governance and accountability regimes
• conduct of business and control requirements, and
• restrictions on compensation.
These types of differences, inconsistencies and 
conflicts in financial services regulation have required 
and could in the future require JPMorganChase to:
• divest assets or restructure its operations
• maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, or 
absorb increased capital and liquidity costs 
• incur higher operational and compliance costs 
• change the prices that it charges for its products and 
services 
• curtail the products and services that it offers to its 
customers and clients
• curtail other business opportunities, including 
acquisitions or principal investments, that it 
otherwise would have pursued
• become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or 
other sanctions, or
• incur higher costs for complying with different legal 
and regulatory frameworks. 
Any or all of these factors could harm 
JPMorganChase’s ability to compete against other 
firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and 
regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm 
JPMorganChase’s businesses, results of operations 
and profitability.
Resolving regulatory investigations can subject 
JPMorganChase to significant penalties and 
collateral consequences, and could result in higher 
compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.
JPMorganChase is subject to heightened oversight 
and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many 
jurisdictions. JPMorganChase has paid significant 
fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other 
Part I
12
penalties and experienced other repercussions in 
connection with resolving investigations and 
enforcement actions by governmental agencies. 
JPMorganChase could become subject to similar 
regulatory or governmental resolutions or other 
actions in the future, and addressing the requirements 
of any such resolutions or actions could result in 
JPMorganChase incurring higher operational and 
compliance costs, including devoting substantial 
resources to the required remediation or needing to 
comply with other restrictions. 
In connection with resolving specific regulatory 
investigations or enforcement actions, certain 
regulators have required JPMorganChase and other 
financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect 
to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These 
types of admissions can lead to:
• greater exposure in litigation
• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation
• disqualification from doing business with certain 
clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or
• other direct and indirect adverse effects.
Furthermore, government officials in the U.S. and other 
countries have demonstrated a willingness to bring 
criminal actions against financial institutions and have 
required that institutions plead guilty to criminal 
offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with 
resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement 
actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant 
collateral consequences for the subject financial 
institution, including:
• loss of clients, customers and business
• restrictions on offering certain products or services, 
and 
• losing permission to operate certain businesses, 
either temporarily or permanently.
JPMorganChase expects that: 
• it and other financial services firms will continue to 
be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and 
governmental investigations and enforcement 
actions
• governmental authorities will continue to require 
that financial institutions be penalized for actual or 
deemed violations of law with formal and punitive 
enforcement actions, including the imposition of 
significant monetary and other sanctions, rather 
than resolving these matters through informal 
supervisory actions, and  
• governmental authorities will be more likely to 
pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions 
against JPMorganChase to the extent that it has 
previously been subject to other governmental 
investigations or enforcement actions.
If JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements of 
any resolution of a governmental investigation or 
enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control 
processes that meet the heightened standards and 
expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, 
among other things:
• enter into further resolutions of investigations or 
enforcement actions
• pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into 
judgments, or
• accept material regulatory restrictions on, or 
changes in the management of, its businesses.
In these circumstances, JPMorganChase could also 
become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution 
or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave 
rise to an investigation or enforcement action. In 
addition, JPMorganChase can be subject to higher 
costs or requests for additional capital in connection 
with the resolution of governmental investigations and 
enforcement actions involving newly-acquired 
businesses, companies in which JPMorganChase has 
made principal investments, parties to joint ventures 
with JPMorganChase, and vendors with which 
JPMorganChase does business.
JPMorganChase’s operations and financial results 
can be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with less 
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.
JPMorganChase conducts existing and new business 
in certain countries, states, municipalities, territories 
and other jurisdictions in which the application of the 
rule of law is inconsistent, extralegal or less 
predictable, including with respect to:
• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or 
guidance for engaging in specific types of business 
or transactions
• conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules, regulations and 
judicial orders, or the inconsistent application or 
interpretation of existing laws, rules, regulations and 
judicial precedents
• actions by or at the direction of government officials 
or agencies
• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of 
intellectual property rights or contractual or other 
obligations
• difficulty in competing in economies in which the 
government controls or protects all or a portion of 
the local economy or specific businesses, or where 
graft or corruption may be pervasive 
• the threat of regulatory investigations, civil 
litigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary 
or otherwise contrary to established legal principles 
in other parts of the world, and  
13
• the termination of licenses required to operate in the 
local market or the suspension of business 
relationships with governmental bodies.
If the application of the laws, rules, regulations and 
judicial precedents in any jurisdiction is susceptible to 
producing outcomes that are inconsistent, unexpected 
or contrary to established legal principles, this can 
create a more difficult environment in which 
JPMorganChase conducts its business and could 
negatively affect JPMorganChase’s operations and 
reduce its earnings with respect to that jurisdiction.  
For example, JPMorganChase has faced actual and 
threatened litigation in Russia with respect to 
payments that JPMorganChase cannot make under, 
and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, 
relevant economic sanctions laws. That litigation has 
also resulted in the seizure of assets. In addition, 
conducting business in jurisdictions with less 
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks could 
require JPMorganChase to devote significant 
additional resources to understanding local laws, rules 
and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to 
comply with local laws, rules and regulations and 
implementing and administering related internal 
policies and procedures.
There can be no assurance that JPMorganChase will 
always be successful in its efforts to fully understand 
and to conduct its business in compliance with the 
laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in 
which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance, or of 
interference with JPMorganChase's businesses, can be 
greater in jurisdictions that have less predictable legal 
and regulatory frameworks.
JPMorganChase's businesses may be negatively 
impacted by governmental policies that either 
discourage or penalize business with certain 
industries or require specific business practices.
JPMorganChase's businesses and results of 
operations may be adversely affected by actions or 
initiatives by national, state or local governmental 
authorities that:
• seek to discourage financial institutions from doing 
business with companies engaged in certain 
industries, or conversely, to penalize financial 
institutions that elect not to do business with such 
companies, or
• mandate specific business practices that companies 
operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.
Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may 
differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, 
JPMorganChase may face negative consequences 
regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not 
to take, including:
• restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within 
a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental 
entities in a jurisdiction
• the threat of enforcement actions, including under 
antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and 
regulations, and
• harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, 
including from politicians, activists and other 
stakeholders.
JPMorganChase has been prohibited from engaging in 
certain business activities in specific jurisdictions as a 
result of these types of governmental actions, and 
there is no assurance that it will not face similar 
restrictions on its business and operations in the 
future.
Requirements for the orderly resolution of 
JPMorganChase could result in JPMorganChase 
having to restructure or reorganize its businesses 
and could increase its funding or operational costs or 
curtail its businesses.
JPMorganChase is required under Federal Reserve 
and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to 
those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly 
resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary 
government support, in the event of material financial 
distress or failure. The evaluation of JPMorganChase’s 
resolution plan by these agencies may change, and the 
requirements for resolution plans may be modified 
from time to time. Any such determinations or 
modifications could result in JPMorganChase needing 
to make changes to its legal entity structure or to 
certain internal or external activities, which could 
increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its 
ability to serve clients and customers.
If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to 
determine that a resolution plan submitted by 
JPMorganChase has deficiencies, they could jointly 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity 
requirements or restrictions on JPMorganChase’s 
growth, activities or operations. The agencies could 
also require that JPMorganChase restructure, 
reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that 
could materially and adversely affect 
JPMorganChase’s operations and strategy. 
Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity 
securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a 
resolution.
Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & 
Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels 
of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-
absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) 
for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorganChase’s 
operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to 
enter into a resolution either: 
• in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  
• in a receivership administered by the FDIC under 
Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  
Part I
14
If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, 
holders of eligible LTD, other unsecured creditors and 
holders of equity securities of the Parent Company will 
absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. 
The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under 
JPMorganChase’s resolution plan contemplates that 
the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy 
proceedings and JPMorganChase’s material 
subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that 
they could continue normal operations or 
subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly 
manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and 
any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be 
imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s 
equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured 
creditors, including holders of eligible LTD. Claims of 
the Parent Company's shareholders and unsecured 
creditors would have a junior position to the claims of 
creditors of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries and to the 
claims of priority (as determined by statute) and 
secured creditors of the Parent Company.   
Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in 
bankruptcy, unsecured creditors of the Parent 
Company, including holders of eligible LTD of the 
Parent Company, would realize value only to the extent 
available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, 
and only after any claims of priority and secured 
creditors of the Parent Company have been fully 
repaid. 
The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of 
entry recapitalization model would be its expected 
strategy to resolve a systemically important financial 
institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. 
However, the FDIC has not formally adopted or 
committed to any specific resolution strategy. 
If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, 
a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal 
Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow 
JPMorganChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and 
losses to unsecured creditors of the Parent Company, 
including holders of eligible LTD, and to holders of 
equity securities of the Parent Company, under 
whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be 
greater than they might have been under 
JPMorganChase’s preferred strategy.  
Political
Economic uncertainty or instability caused by 
political and geopolitical developments can 
negatively impact JPMorganChase’s businesses.
Political developments in the U.S. and other countries 
can cause uncertainty in the economic environment 
and market conditions in which JPMorganChase 
operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy 
initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, 
could significantly affect U.S. and global economic 
growth and cause higher volatility in the financial 
markets, including:
• monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal 
Reserve and other central banks or governmental 
authorities, including changes in interest rate levels 
and any sustained large-scale asset purchases or 
any suspension or reversal of those actions
• fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and 
spending
• isolationist foreign policies
• economic or financial sanctions
• the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist 
trade policies
• changes to immigration policies, or
• actions that the government takes or fails to take in 
response to the effects of health emergencies, the 
spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or 
pandemics.
These types of political developments, and uncertainty 
about the possible outcomes of these developments, 
could:
• erode investor or consumer confidence in the U.S. 
economy and financial markets, which could 
potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as 
a safe haven currency
• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other 
countries and otherwise heighten tensions in 
regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations
• increase the risk of targeted cyber attacks
• increase concerns about whether the U.S. 
government will be funded, and its outstanding debt 
serviced, at any particular time
• result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government 
• influence investor perceptions concerning 
government support of certain sectors of the 
economy or the economy as a whole
• influence monetary policy actions of the Federal 
Reserve to moderate the economic impact of 
political developments, including decisions on 
interest rate levels and asset purchases and sales
• adversely affect the financial condition or credit 
ratings of clients and counterparties with which 
JPMorganChase does business, or
• cause JPMorganChase to refrain from engaging in 
business opportunities that it might otherwise 
pursue.
These factors could lead to:
• slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession
• disruptions in labor markets
• greater market volatility
15
• a contraction of available credit and the widening of 
credit spreads
• U.S. dollar currency fluctuations
• lower investments in a particular country or sector of 
the economy
• large-scale sales of government debt and other debt 
and equity securities
• reduced commercial activity among trading partners 
or disruptions to supply chains, or
• the possible departure of a country from, or the 
dissolution or formation of, a political or economic 
alliance or treaty.
Under certain circumstances, such as geopolitically 
challenging situations in regions like Russia, the 
Middle East and China, these various risks could 
become highly correlated or combine in 
unprecedented ways.
Any of these potential outcomes could cause 
JPMorganChase to suffer losses on its market-making 
positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its 
liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for 
credit losses or lead to higher net charge-offs, hamper 
its ability to deliver products and services to its clients 
and customers, and weaken its results of operations 
and financial condition or credit rating.
Market
Economic and market events and conditions can 
materially affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and 
investment and market-making positions.
JPMorganChase’s results of operations can be 
negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the 
following:
• investor, consumer and business sentiment
• events that reduce confidence in the financial 
markets
• inflation, deflation or recession
• high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening 
labor market
• the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit
• levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads 
and market prices for currencies, debt and equity 
securities and commodities, as well as the duration 
of any such changes
• the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of 
war, hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical 
instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural 
disasters, severe weather conditions, health 
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, 
epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary 
events beyond JPMorganChase’s control, and
• the state of the U.S. and global economies.
All of these are affected by global economic, market 
and political events and conditions, including 
monetary policies and actions taken by central banks 
or other governmental authorities, as well as by the 
regulatory environment.
In addition, JPMorganChase’s investment portfolio and 
market-making businesses can suffer losses due to 
unanticipated market events, including:
• severe declines in asset values
• unexpected credit events
• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause 
previously uncorrelated factors to become 
correlated (and vice versa)
• the inability to effectively hedge risks related to 
market-making and investment portfolio positions, 
or
• other market risks that may not have been 
appropriately taken into account in the 
development, structuring or pricing of a financial 
instrument.
If JPMorganChase experiences significant losses in its 
investment portfolio or from market-making activities, 
this could reduce JPMorganChase’s profitability and 
its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain 
the growth of its businesses.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can be 
negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 
and governmental policies.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses are 
particularly affected by U.S. and global economic 
conditions, including:
• personal and household income distribution
• unemployment or underemployment
• prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low 
interest rates, or significant changes to interest rates
• changes in the value of collateral such as residential 
real estate and vehicles
• changes in housing prices
• the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods 
and services
• consumer and small business confidence levels, and
• changes in consumer spending or in the level of 
consumer debt.
Heightened levels of unemployment or 
underemployment that result in reduced personal and 
household income could negatively affect consumer 
credit performance to the extent that consumers are 
less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained 
low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary 
pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish 
customer demand for the products and services 
offered by JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses. 
Part I
16
Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an 
increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance 
for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can 
reduce JPMorganChase’s earnings. These 
consequences could be significantly worse in certain 
geographies, including where declining industrial or 
manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in 
higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of 
consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, 
could impair the ability of customers to pay their other 
consumer loan obligations.
JPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer 
businesses could also be adversely affected by 
governmental policies and actions that affect 
consumers, including:
• policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, 
education, immigration and housing, or that may 
impact employment status
• laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the 
financial services industry, such as limitations on late 
payment, overdraft and interchange fees, and
• policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such 
as higher taxes and increased regulation, which 
could result in reductions in consumer disposable 
income.
Unfavorable market and economic conditions can 
have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s 
wholesale businesses.
In JPMorganChase’s wholesale businesses, market 
and economic factors can affect the volume of 
transactions that JPMorganChase executes for its 
clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, 
the revenue that JPMorganChase receives from those 
transactions. These factors can also influence the 
willingness of other financial institutions and investors 
to participate in capital markets transactions that 
JPMorganChase manages, such as loan syndications 
or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant 
and sustained deterioration in market conditions were 
to occur, the profitability of JPMorganChase’s 
businesses engaged in capital markets activities, 
including loan syndication, securities underwriting and 
leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the 
extent that those businesses:
• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction 
volumes, including when clients are unwilling or 
unable to refinance their outstanding debt 
obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or
• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, 
or hold larger residual positions in credit 
commitments that cannot be sold at favorable 
prices.
The fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing 
client assets or holding assets under custody for 
clients could be diminished by declining asset values 
or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For 
example, higher interest rates or a downturn in 
financial markets could affect the valuation of client 
assets that JPMorganChase manages or holds under 
custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorganChase’s 
revenue from fees that are based on the amount of 
assets under management or custody. Similarly, 
adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could 
prompt outflows from JPMorganChase funds or 
accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that 
generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected 
withdrawals from a JPMorganChase fund can also 
hamper the investment performance of the fund, 
particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund 
to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or 
prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on 
the weaker investment performance.
An adverse change in market conditions in particular 
segments of the economy, such as a sudden and 
severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in 
commodity prices, severe declines in commercial real 
estate values, or sustained changes in consumer 
behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could 
have a material adverse effect on clients of 
JPMorganChase whose operations or financial 
condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the 
health or stability of those market segments or 
economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged 
in related businesses. JPMorganChase could incur 
credit losses on its loans and other commitments to 
clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector 
of the economy that is or comes under stress.
An economic downturn or sustained changes in 
consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer 
and business spending could also have a negative 
impact on certain of JPMorganChase’s wholesale 
clients, and thereby diminish JPMorganChase’s 
earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, 
the businesses of certain of JPMorganChase’s 
wholesale clients are dependent on consistent 
streams of rental income from commercial real estate 
properties, including offices, which are owned or being 
built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic 
conditions or hybrid work models could result in 
reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or 
developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, 
could depress the values of the properties, impair the 
ability of borrowers to service or refinance their 
commercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in 
foreclosures. These consequences could result in 
JPMorganChase experiencing increases in the 
allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, 
defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real 
estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for 
servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that 
portfolio. An increase in foreclosures could result in 
higher operational risk associated with 
JPMorganChase owning and managing real property, 
17
and any inadequacy in governance or control over the 
foreclosed properties could result in regulatory 
scrutiny and reputational harm.
Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can 
adversely affect JPMorganChase’s earnings, its 
liquidity or its capital levels. 
When interest rates are high or increasing, 
JPMorganChase can generally be expected to earn 
higher net interest income. However, higher interest 
rates can also lead to:
• fewer originations of commercial and residential real 
estate loans 
• losses on underwriting exposures or incremental 
client-specific downgrades, or increases in the 
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due 
to higher financing costs for clients
• the loss of deposits, particularly if customers 
withdraw deposits because they believe that interest 
rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than 
those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes 
incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior
• losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in 
the investment securities portfolio
• lower net interest income if central banks introduce 
interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated 
and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of 
short-term and long-term borrowings
• less liquidity in the financial markets, and
• higher funding costs.
All of these outcomes could adversely affect 
JPMorganChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital 
levels, and any negative outcomes could be more 
severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. 
Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the 
payment performance on loans within 
JPMorganChase’s consumer and wholesale loan 
portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If 
borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford 
higher interest payments, those borrowers may 
reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing 
JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased 
operational costs related to servicing a higher volume 
of delinquent loans. 
On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate 
environment may cause:
• net interest margins to be compressed, which could 
reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on 
its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it 
is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-
yielding instruments
• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor 
behavior, which could negatively affect 
JPMorganChase’s broader asset and liability 
management strategy, and
• a reduction in the value of JPMorganChase’s 
mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, resulting 
in decreased revenues.
When credit spreads widen, it becomes more 
expensive for JPMorganChase to borrow. 
JPMorganChase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow 
not only in response to events and circumstances that 
are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of 
general economic and geopolitical events and 
conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase’s credit 
spreads will affect, positively or negatively, 
JPMorganChase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such 
as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. 
JPMorganChase’s results may be materially affected 
by market fluctuations and significant changes in the 
valuation of financial instruments.
The value of securities, derivatives and other financial 
instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it 
makes markets can be materially affected by market 
fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market 
conditions and other disruptions in the financial 
markets may make it extremely difficult to value 
certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of 
financial instruments in future periods, in light of 
factors then prevailing, may result in significant 
changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, 
at the time of any disposition of these financial 
instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately 
realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the 
market at that time and may be materially lower than 
their current fair value. Any of these factors could 
cause a decline in the value of financial instruments 
that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes 
markets, which may have an adverse effect on 
JPMorganChase’s results of operations.
JPMorganChase’s risk management and monitoring 
processes, including its stress testing framework, seek 
to quantify and manage JPMorganChase’s exposure to 
more extreme market moves. However, 
JPMorganChase’s hedging and other risk 
management strategies may not be effective, and it 
could incur significant losses, if extreme market events 
were to occur.
Credit
JPMorganChase can be negatively affected by 
adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, 
counterparties, custodians and CCPs.
JPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with 
clients and counterparties such as corporations, 
financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, 
securities exchanges and government entities within 
and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions 
expose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients 
and counterparties, and can involve JPMorganChase in 
disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty 
defaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses 
Part I
18
or liability where a financial institution that it has 
appointed to provide custodial services for client 
assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud 
or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, 
or where clients are unable to access assets held by 
JPMorganChase as custodian due to governmental 
actions or other factors.
A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a 
CCP through which JPMorganChase executes 
contracts would require JPMorganChase to replace 
those contracts, thereby increasing its operational 
costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, 
JPMorganChase can be exposed to losses if a member 
of a CCP in which JPMorganChase is also a member 
defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of 
requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a 
portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorganChase 
can be subject to bearing its share of non-default 
losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from 
custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to 
cyber or other security breaches.
As part of its clearing services activities, 
JPMorganChase is exposed to the risk of 
nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to 
mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate 
collateral. JPMorganChase is also exposed to intra-day 
credit risk of its clients in connection with providing 
cash management, clearing, custodial and other 
transaction services to those clients. If a client for 
which JPMorganChase provides these services 
becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorganChase may 
incur losses, become involved in disputes and 
litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s 
bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to 
regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events 
can increase JPMorganChase’s operational and 
litigation costs, and JPMorganChase may suffer losses 
to the extent that any collateral that it has received is 
insufficient to cover those losses.
Transactions with government entities, including 
national, state, provincial, municipal and local 
authorities, can expose JPMorganChase to enhanced 
sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. 
Government entities may, among other things, claim 
that actions taken by government officials were 
beyond the legal authority of those officials or 
repudiate transactions authorized by a previous 
incumbent government. These types of actions have in 
the past caused, and could in the future cause, 
JPMorganChase to suffer losses or hamper its ability 
to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.
In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit 
JPMorganChase’s ability to resolve disputes and 
litigation in the event of a counterparty default or 
unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon 
payments, which could subject JPMorganChase to 
losses.
Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives 
contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement 
procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The 
disposition of those disputes could cause 
JPMorganChase to incur unexpected transaction, 
operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. 
These consequences can also impair 
JPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage its 
credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause 
harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
The financial or operational failure of a significant 
market participant, such as a major financial institution 
or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of 
such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its 
obligations, can cause substantial and cascading 
disruption within the financial markets, including in 
circumstances where coordinated action by multiple 
other market participants is required to address the 
failure or disruption. JPMorganChase’s businesses 
could be significantly disrupted by such an event, 
particularly if it leads to other market participants 
incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity 
issues or defaulting, and JPMorganChase is likely to 
have significant interrelationships with, and credit 
exposure to, such a significant market participant.
JPMorganChase may suffer losses if the value of 
collateral declines in stressed market conditions.
During periods of market stress or illiquidity, 
JPMorganChase’s credit risk may be further increased 
when:
• JPMorganChase fails to realize the estimated value 
of the collateral it holds
• collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient 
to recover the full amount owed to it, or
• counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether 
for operational or other reasons.
Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning 
the valuation of collateral may increase in times of 
significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and 
JPMorganChase could suffer losses during these 
periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of 
collateral or to manage declines in the value of 
collateral.
JPMorganChase could incur significant losses 
arising from concentrations of credit and market 
risk.
JPMorganChase is exposed to greater credit and 
market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or 
counterparties, or obligors on securities and other 
financial instruments:
• engage in similar or related businesses, or in 
businesses in related industries
• do business in the same geographic region, or
19
• have business profiles, models or strategies that 
could cause their ability to meet their obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes in economic 
conditions. 
For example, a significant deterioration in the credit 
quality of a counterparty, borrower or other obligor 
could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of 
other counterparties, borrowers or obligors in similar, 
related or dependent industries. This type of 
interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorganChase’s 
credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and 
potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value 
losses in its market-making businesses and 
investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorganChase 
may be required to increase the allowance for credit 
losses or establish other reserves with respect to 
certain clients, industries or country exposures in 
order to align with directives or expectations of its 
banking regulators. 
Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect 
a particular industry or geographic area could lead to 
concerns about the credit quality of counterparties, 
borrowers or other obligors not only in that particular 
industry or geography but in related or dependent 
industries, wherever located. These conditions could 
also heighten concerns about the ability of customers 
of JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses who live in 
those areas or work in those affected industries or 
related or dependent industries to meet their 
obligations to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase 
regularly monitors various segments of its credit and 
market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of 
concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify 
or hedge its exposure against those risks may be 
limited.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can also be 
harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit 
by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened 
competition for certain types of consumer loans could 
prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant 
reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or 
the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If 
large numbers of consumers subsequently default on 
their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an 
economic downturn or other factors, this could impair 
their ability to repay obligations owed to 
JPMorganChase and result in higher charge-offs and 
other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread 
defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary 
conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorganChase’s 
consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in 
such an environment.
If JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions 
effectively during a market dislocation, this can 
increase both the market and credit risks associated 
with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-
assets (“RWA”) that JPMorganChase holds on its 
balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect 
JPMorganChase’s capital position, funding costs and 
the profitability of its businesses.
Liquidity
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses 
could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. 
JPMorganChase’s liquidity can be impacted at any 
given time as a result of factors such as:
• market-wide illiquidity or disruption
• changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting 
from changes in laws, rules and regulations, 
including those in response to economic effects of 
systemic events
• actions taken by the U.S. government or by the 
Federal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which 
may reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and 
other financial institutions
• inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable 
times or prices
• default by a CCP or other significant market 
participant
• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral
• unexpected loss of deposits or higher than 
anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, 
and
• lack of market or customer confidence in 
JPMorganChase or financial institutions in general. 
A reduction in JPMorganChase’s liquidity may be 
caused by events over which it has little or no control. 
For example, periods of market stress, low investor 
confidence and significant market illiquidity could 
result in higher funding costs for JPMorganChase and 
could limit its access to some of its traditional sources 
of liquidity. 
JPMorganChase may need to raise funding from 
alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-
cost sources of funding, such as deposits and 
borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is 
reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more 
expensive or limited in availability. JPMorganChase’s 
funding costs could also be negatively affected by 
actions that JPMorganChase may take in order to:
• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net 
stable funding ratio requirements
• address obligations under its resolution plan, or
• satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions 
outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of 
liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal 
entities.
More generally, if JPMorganChase fails to effectively 
manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to 
fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and 
thereby adversely affect its results of operations.
Part I
20
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and 
depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make 
payments on its outstanding securities.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that 
holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an 
intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally 
holds the stock of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other 
than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. 
The IHC also owns other assets and provides 
intercompany lending to the Parent Company. 
The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the 
IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from 
securities issuances (including issuances of senior and 
subordinated debt securities and of preferred and 
common stock).
The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC 
to make payments to the Parent Company is also 
limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to 
regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as 
well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the 
Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity 
requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its 
ability to make payments to the Parent Company. The 
IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending 
credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or 
liquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are 
otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s 
management or Board of Directors. 
As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the 
Parent Company to make various payments is 
dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from 
the IHC. These limitations could affect the Parent 
Company’s ability to:
• pay interest on its debt securities
• pay dividends on its equity securities
• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and
• fulfill its other payment obligations.
These arrangements could also result in the Parent 
Company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a 
time earlier than would have been the case absent the 
existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to 
which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are 
subject.
Reductions in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings may 
adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal 
subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating 
agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry-
specific factors when determining credit ratings for a 
particular financial institution, including:
• expected future profitability 
• risk management practices
• legal expenses
• ratings differentials between bank holding 
companies and their bank and non-bank 
subsidiaries
• regulatory developments 
• assumptions about government support, and 
• economic and geopolitical developments. 
JPMorganChase closely monitors and manages, to the 
extent that it is able, factors that could influence its 
credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that 
JPMorganChase’s credit ratings will not be 
downgraded in the future. Furthermore, any such 
downgrade could occur at times of broader market 
instability when JPMorganChase’s options for 
responding to events may be more limited and general 
investor confidence is low.
A reduction in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings could 
curtail JPMorganChase’s business activities and 
reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:
• reducing its access to capital markets 
• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing 
securities 
• triggering additional collateral or funding 
requirements, and 
• decreasing the number of investors and 
counterparties that are willing or permitted to do 
business with or lend to JPMorganChase.
Any rating reduction could also increase the credit 
spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk 
on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This 
could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and 
other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its 
subsidiaries.
Capital
Maintaining the required level and composition of 
capital may impact JPMorganChase’s ability to 
support business activities, meet evolving 
regulatory requirements and distribute capital to 
shareholders.
JPMorganChase is subject to various regulatory 
capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-
based capital requirements. In addition, as a Global 
Systemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorganChase 
is required to hold additional capital buffers, including 
a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a 
countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at 
least annually. The amount of capital that 
JPMorganChase is required to hold in order to satisfy 
these leverage- and risk-based requirements could 
increase at any given time due to factors such as:
• actions by banking regulators, including changes in 
laws, rules and regulations
21
• changes in the composition of JPMorganChase’s 
balance sheet or developments that could increase 
RWA, such as increased market risk, customer 
delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or 
other factors, and
• increases in estimated stress losses as determined 
by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase 
JPMorganChase’s SCB.
Any failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to 
maintain the required level and composition of capital, 
or unfavorable changes in applicable capital 
requirements, could have an adverse impact on 
JPMorganChase’s shareholders, such as:
• reducing the amount of common stock that 
JPMorganChase is permitted to repurchase
• requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the 
redemption of, capital instruments in a manner 
inconsistent with JPMorganChase’s capital 
management strategy
• constraining the amount of dividends that may be 
paid on common stock, or
• curtailing JPMorganChase’s business activities or 
operations.
In 2023, U.S. banking regulators released a proposal to 
implement the final Basel III reforms which would have 
significantly revised the risk-based capital 
requirements for banks with assets of $100 billion or 
more, including JPMorganChase. In addition, in 2023 
the Federal Reserve released a proposal to amend the 
calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Uncertainty remains 
regarding the content of the final versions of these rule 
proposals and how they might ultimately apply to 
JPMorganChase. However, it is possible that the final 
rules could impact JPMorganChase’s decisions 
concerning the business activities in which it will 
engage and its levels of capital distributions to its 
shareholders. 
Operational
JPMorganChase’s businesses are dependent on the 
effectiveness of internal and external operational 
systems.
JPMorganChase’s businesses rely on the ability of 
JPMorganChase’s financial, accounting, transaction 
execution, data processing and other operational 
systems, including devices supporting those systems, 
to process, record, monitor and report a large number 
of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so 
accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper 
design, installation, maintenance and training, the 
effective functioning of JPMorganChase’s operational 
systems depends on:
• the quality of the information contained in those 
systems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or 
corrupted data can significantly compromise the 
functionality or reliability of a particular system and 
other systems to which it transmits or from which it 
receives information, and
• JPMorganChase’s ability to continue to maintain and 
upgrade its systems on a regular and timely basis in 
line with technological advancements and evolving 
security requirements, maintain security and 
operational continuity of its systems, including by 
carefully managing any changes introduced to its 
systems, prevent unauthorized access and the 
misuse of access to its systems, and adhere to all 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, 
particularly in regions where JPMorganChase may 
face a heightened risk of malicious activity.
JPMorganChase has experienced and expects that it 
will continue to experience failures and disruptions in 
the stability of its operational systems, including 
degraded performance of data processing systems, 
data quality issues, disruptions of network connectivity 
and malfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in 
its ability to access and use the operational systems of 
third parties and interruptions in service from third-
party service providers. These incidents have resulted 
in various negative effects for customers, including the 
inability to access account information or transact 
through ATM, internet or mobile channels, the 
exfiltration of customer personal data, the recording of 
duplicative transactions and extended delays for 
customers requiring services from call centers. There 
can be no assurance that these and other types of 
operational failures or disruptions will not occur in the 
future.
JPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage the 
stability of its operational systems and infrastructure 
could be hindered by many factors, any of which could 
have a negative impact on JPMorganChase and its 
clients, customers and counterparties, including:
• JPMorganChase’s ability to effectively maintain and 
upgrade systems and infrastructure can become 
more challenging as the speed, frequency, volume, 
interconnectivity and complexity of transactions 
continue to increase
• attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorganChase 
or its clients and customers continue to increase, 
evolve and become more complex, and during 
periods of market disruption or economic 
uncertainty, these attempts can be expected to 
further increase in volume
• errors made by JPMorganChase or another market 
participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, could 
cause widespread system disruption
• failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in 
operational systems in a timely manner
• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in 
operational systems could compound, or migrate to 
other systems over time, to become larger issues
Part I
22
• disruptions in operational systems or in the ability of 
systems to communicate with each other could be 
caused by failures in synchronization or encryption 
software, or degraded performance of 
microprocessors, and
• attempts by third parties to block the use of key 
technology solutions by claiming that the use 
infringes on their intellectual property rights.
JPMorganChase also depends on its ability to access 
and use the operational systems of third parties, 
including its custodians, vendors (such as those that 
provide data and cloud computing services, and 
security and technology services) and other market 
participants (such as clearing and payment systems, 
CCPs and securities exchanges). These external 
operational systems with which JPMorgan is 
connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be 
sources of operational risk to JPMorganChase. 
JPMorganChase may be exposed not only to a 
systems failure or cyber attack that may be 
experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with 
which JPMorganChase is directly connected, but also 
to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving 
another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure 
is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and 
processors, data aggregators and other external 
parties with which JPMorganChase’s customers do 
business can increase JPMorganChase’s operational 
risk. This is particularly the case where activities of 
customers or other parties are beyond 
JPMorganChase’s security and control systems, 
including through the use of the internet, cloud 
computing services, and personal smart phones and 
other mobile devices or services.
If an external party obtains access to customer 
account data on JPMorganChase’s systems, whether 
authorized or unauthorized, and that party 
misappropriates that data, this could result in negative 
outcomes for JPMorganChase and its clients and 
customers, including a heightened risk of fraudulent 
transactions using JPMorganChase’s systems, losses 
from fraudulent transactions and reputational harm 
arising from the perception that JPMorganChase’s 
systems may not be secure.
As JPMorganChase’s interconnectivity with clients, 
customers and other external parties continues to 
expand, JPMorganChase increasingly faces the risk of 
operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the 
systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting 
JPMorganChase’s clients or customers, or systems 
breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human 
error or misconduct affecting other external parties, 
may require JPMorganChase to take steps to protect 
the integrity of its own operational systems or to 
safeguard confidential information, including 
restricting the access of customers to their accounts. 
These actions can increase JPMorganChase’s 
operational costs and potentially diminish customer 
satisfaction and confidence in JPMorganChase.
Furthermore, the widespread and expanding 
interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing 
banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial 
technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing 
houses and other financial market infrastructures 
increases the risk that the disruption of an operational 
system involving one institution or entity, including 
due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide 
operational disruptions that could materially affect 
JPMorganChase’s ability to conduct business. In 
addition, the risks associated with the disruption of an 
operational system of a third party could be 
exacerbated to the extent that the services provided 
by that system are used by a significant number or 
proportion of market participants.
The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of 
operational systems upon which JPMorganChase 
depends, including due to a systems malfunction, 
cyber incident or other systems failure, could result in 
unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and 
for JPMorganChase and its clients and customers, 
including:
• delays or other disruptions in providing services, 
including the provision of liquidity or information to 
clients and customers
• impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to execute 
transactions, including delays or failures in the 
confirmation or settlement of transactions or in 
obtaining access to funds or other assets required 
for settlement
• the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets 
trades or other transactions are executed 
erroneously
• financial losses, including due to loss-sharing 
requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other 
market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to 
clients and customers
• higher operational costs associated with replacing 
services provided by a system that has experienced 
a failure or other disruption 
• limitations on JPMorganChase's ability to collect 
data needed for its business and operations
• loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorganChase, 
or financial institutions generally, to protect against 
and withstand operational disruptions
• dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients or 
customers
• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory 
fines, penalties or other sanctions, and 
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
If JPMorganChase’s operational systems, or those of 
acquired businesses or of external parties on which 
23
JPMorganChase’s businesses depend, are unable to 
meet the requirements of JPMorganChase’s 
businesses and operations or bank regulatory 
standards, or if they fail or have other significant 
shortcomings, JPMorganChase could be materially 
and adversely affected.
A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorganChase 
could cause significant harm to JPMorganChase and 
its clients and customers.
JPMorganChase experiences numerous cyber attacks 
on its computer systems, software, networks and other 
technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, 
including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, 
cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or 
groups that use technology to promote a political 
agenda or social change) and others. These cyber 
attacks can take many forms, including attempts to 
introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which 
are commonly referred to as “malware,” into 
JPMorganChase’s systems. These attacks are often 
designed to:
• obtain unauthorized access to JPMorganChase's 
systems or to confidential information belonging to 
JPMorganChase or its clients, customers, 
counterparties or employees
• manipulate data
• destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering 
services unavailable
• disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on 
JPMorganChase’s systems
• steal money, or
• extort money through the use of so-called 
“ransomware.”
JPMorganChase also experiences:
• distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to 
disrupt JPMorganChase’s websites, including those 
that provide online banking and other services,
• a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks 
against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical 
tensions, and
• a high volume of disruptions to internet-based 
services used by JPMorganChase that are provided 
by third parties.
JPMorganChase has experienced security breaches 
due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that 
additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such 
breach could result in serious and harmful 
consequences for JPMorganChase or its clients and 
customers.
A principal reason that JPMorganChase cannot 
provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that 
it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or 
recognize threats to JPMorganChase’s systems, or to 
implement effective preventive measures against all 
breaches due to evolving risks, including:
• the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve 
frequently and increase in sophistication, and 
therefore may not be recognized until launched or 
may go undetected for extended periods
• cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of 
sources, including JPMorganChase’s own 
employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups 
linked to terrorist organizations or hostile nation-
states that can sustain malicious activities for 
extended periods, or third parties whose objective is 
to disrupt the operations of financial institutions 
more generally
• JPMorganChase does not have control over the 
cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of 
clients, customers, counterparties and third-party 
service providers with which it does business, and
• it is possible that a third party, after establishing a 
foothold on an internal network without being 
detected, may gain access to other networks and 
systems.
The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack 
could increase in the future due to factors such as: 
• JPMorganChase’s ongoing expansion of its digital 
banking and other internet-based product offerings 
and its internal use of internet-based products and 
applications, including those that use cloud 
computing services
• advances in artificial intelligence, such as the use of 
machine learning, generative artificial intelligence 
and quantum computing by malicious actors to 
develop more advanced social engineering attacks, 
including targeted phishing attacks
• the inability to maintain the security of information 
transmitted by JPMorganChase due to advances in 
quantum computing that may counteract or nullify 
existing information protections, and
• the acquisition and integration of new businesses.
In addition, a third party could misappropriate 
confidential information obtained by intercepting 
signals or communications from mobile devices used 
by JPMorganChase’s employees.
The dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape, 
including the pace of innovation and increased threat 
of novel attack methods, necessitates ongoing 
investment in, as well as enhancement and adaptation 
of, cybersecurity controls, including the adoption of 
enhanced security measures in certain jurisdictions. 
Failure to discover or address emerging threats, 
known vulnerabilities or shortcomings in cybersecurity 
controls, or to prioritize or complete enhancements to 
address them, in each case in a timely manner, may 
leave JPMorganChase vulnerable to cyber attacks, 
potentially resulting in data breaches, financial losses, 
Part I
24
reputational damage and regulatory penalties, 
including the failure to prioritize or complete 
enhancements relating to:
• preventing unauthorized access and protecting 
against the misuse of access, including the 
maintenance and enhancement of controls related 
to secure software development practices and 
identity and access management, such as those 
relating to the management of administrative access 
to systems
• detecting, escalating and addressing effectively and 
in a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may be 
present either in internally-developed software or 
externally-provided software or services, including 
vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit 
unknown security flaws in software and hardware 
(“zero-day vulnerabilities”)
• oversight of third-party vendors and early detection 
of attacks against those vendors, including 
ransomware attacks and attacks targeting 
vulnerabilities in third-party open-source software, 
in support of the secure development and 
maintenance of internal systems
• maintaining and enhancing controls related to 
technology asset management and inventory 
systems to prevent the risk of undetected 
vulnerabilities that could undermine 
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate an effective 
control process 
• upgrading the coverage and capabilities of systems 
and controls to protect JPMorganChase and its 
clients and customers from the impact of distributed 
denial-of-service attacks, or to recover from outages 
that could be caused by a malware or ransomware 
attack
• the continuing migration of client-facing services to 
the cloud, and modernization of those services
• strengthening network security and managing 
outbound connections to reduce the risk of data loss 
• identifying, assessing and mitigating insider threat 
activities that could lead to the misuse of 
JPMorganChase’s systems or client and customer 
information, and
• integrating acquired businesses where system 
integration may be complex or may require 
extensive and lengthy remediation or enhancement 
of controls.
A successful penetration or circumvention of the 
security of JPMorganChase’s systems or the systems 
of a vendor, governmental body or another market 
participant could cause serious negative 
consequences, including:
• significant disruption of JPMorganChase’s 
operations and those of its clients, customers and 
counterparties, including losing access to 
operational systems
• misappropriation of confidential information of 
JPMorganChase or that of its clients, customers, 
counterparties, employees or regulators
• disruption of or damage to JPMorganChase’s 
systems and those of its clients, customers and 
counterparties
• the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully 
recover and restore data that has been stolen, 
manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent 
systems from processing fraudulent transactions
• demands that JPMorganChase pay a ransom to a 
malicious actor that has perpetrated a cybersecurity 
breach
• unintended violations by JPMorganChase of 
applicable privacy and other laws
• financial loss to JPMorganChase or to its clients, 
customers, counterparties or employees
• losses to JPMorganChase in excess of cyber 
insurance policy coverage
• loss of confidence in JPMorganChase’s 
cybersecurity and business resiliency measures
• dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients, 
customers or counterparties
• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory 
fines, penalties or other sanctions, and
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
The extent of a particular cyber attack, the methods 
and tools used by various actors, and the steps that 
JPMorganChase may need to take to investigate the 
attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a 
significant amount of time before such an investigation 
can be completed. While such an investigation is 
ongoing, JPMorganChase may not necessarily know 
the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, 
and that damage may continue to spread. These 
factors may inhibit JPMorganChase’s ability to provide 
rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber 
attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and 
regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may 
not be clear how best to contain and remediate the 
harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or 
actions could be repeated or compounded before they 
are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these 
factors could further increase the costs and 
consequences of a cyber attack.
JPMorganChase can be negatively affected if it fails 
to identify and address operational risks associated 
with the introduction of or changes to products, 
services and delivery platforms or the adoption of 
new technologies.
When JPMorganChase launches a new product or 
service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or 
25
distribution of products or services (including mobile 
connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), 
acquires or invests in a business, makes changes to an 
existing product, service or delivery platform, or 
adopts a new technology, it may not fully appreciate or 
identify new operational risks that may arise from 
those changes, including increased reliance on third 
party providers, or may fail to implement adequate 
controls to mitigate the risks associated with those 
changes. Any significant failure in this regard could 
diminish JPMorganChase’s ability to operate one or 
more of its businesses or result in:
• potential liability to clients, counterparties and 
customers
• higher compliance, operational or integration costs 
• higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, 
penalties and other sanctions
• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation
• impairment of JPMorganChase’s liquidity
• regulatory intervention, or 
• weaker competitive standing.
Any of the foregoing consequences could materially 
and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and 
results of operations.
JPMorganChase’s business and operations rely on 
its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to 
maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on 
the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety 
of employees.
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses 
efficiently and profitably, to offer products and 
services that meet the expectations of its clients and 
customers, and to maintain an effective risk 
management framework is highly dependent on its 
ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the 
competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of its 
employees. JPMorganChase's businesses and 
operations similarly rely on the workforces of third 
parties, including employees of vendors, custodians 
and financial markets infrastructures, and of 
businesses that it may seek to acquire. 
JPMorganChase’s businesses could be materially and 
adversely affected by:
• the ineffective implementation of business decisions
• any failure to institute controls that appropriately 
address risks associated with business activities, or 
to appropriately train employees with respect to 
those risks and controls
• staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets
• the possibility that significant portions of 
JPMorganChase’s workforce are unable to work 
effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, 
shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions 
or other restrictions in connection with health 
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, 
epidemics or pandemics, or due to extraordinary 
events beyond JPMorganChase’s control such as 
natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of 
hostilities
• a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, 
fraud or other unlawful conduct, or
• other negative outcomes caused by human error or 
misconduct by an employee of JPMorganChase or of 
another party on which JPMorganChase’s 
businesses or operations rely.
JPMorganChase’s operations could also be impaired if 
the measures taken by it or by governmental 
authorities to protect the health and safety of its 
employees are ineffective, or if any external party on 
which JPMorganChase relies fails to take appropriate 
and effective actions to protect the health and safety 
of its employees.
JPMorganChase faces substantial legal and 
operational risks in the processing and safeguarding 
of personal information.
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are 
subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and 
regulations, both within and outside the U.S., 
governing the privacy and protection of personal 
information of individuals. Governmental authorities 
around the world have adopted and are considering 
the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory 
initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and 
security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to 
these laws, rules and regulations could result in fines 
or orders requiring that JPMorganChase change its 
data-related practices, which could have an adverse 
effect on JPMorganChase’s ability to provide products 
and otherwise harm its business operations.
Implementing processes relating to JPMorganChase’s 
collection, use, sharing and storage of personal 
information to comply with all applicable laws, rules 
and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including 
where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, 
can:
• increase JPMorganChase’s compliance and 
operating costs
• hinder the development of new products or services, 
curtail the offering of existing products or services, 
or affect how products and services are offered to 
clients and customers
• demand significant oversight by JPMorganChase’s 
management, and 
• require JPMorganChase to structure its businesses, 
operations and systems in less efficient ways. 
Not all of JPMorganChase’s clients, customers, 
vendors, counterparties and other external parties 
may have appropriate controls in place to protect the 
confidentiality, integrity or availability of the 
Part I
26
information exchanged between them and 
JPMorganChase, particularly where information is 
transmitted by electronic means. JPMorganChase 
could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, 
penalties or other sanctions if personal information of 
clients, customers, employees or others were to be 
mishandled or misused, such as situations where such 
information is:
• erroneously provided to parties who are not 
permitted to have the information, or
• intercepted or otherwise compromised by 
unauthorized third parties.
The increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence 
technologies poses a greater risk of identity fraud, as 
malicious actors may exploit artificial intelligence to 
create convincing false identities or manipulate 
verification processes. This challenge necessitates 
ongoing enhancements to client verification systems 
and security protocols to prevent unauthorized access 
and protect sensitive client information. Failure to 
manage these risks or to implement effective 
countermeasures could lead to unauthorized 
transactions, financial losses, reputational damage and 
increased regulatory scrutiny.
Concerns regarding the effectiveness of 
JPMorganChase’s measures to safeguard personal 
information, or the perception that those measures are 
inadequate, could cause JPMorganChase to lose 
existing or potential clients and customers or 
employees, and thereby reduce JPMorganChase’s 
revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure 
by JPMorganChase to comply with applicable privacy 
or data protection laws, rules and regulations, or any 
failure to appropriately calibrate, manage and monitor 
access by employees or third parties to personal 
information, could subject JPMorganChase to 
inquiries, examinations and investigations that could 
result in requirements to modify or cease certain 
operations or practices, significant liabilities or 
regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of 
these could damage JPMorganChase’s reputation and 
otherwise adversely affect its businesses.
In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the 
inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of 
personal information have led to expanded 
governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the 
processing or safeguarding of personal information by 
companies in the U.S. and other countries. That 
scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the 
future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and 
regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and 
storage of personal information. These types of laws, 
rules and regulations can prohibit or significantly 
restrict financial services firms such as 
JPMorganChase from transferring information across 
national borders or sharing information among 
affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby 
increase compliance costs and operational risk, or 
restrict JPMorganChase’s use of personal information 
when developing or offering products or services to 
customers. Some countries are considering or have 
adopted legislation implementing data protection 
requirements or requiring local storage and 
processing of data which could increase the cost and 
complexity of JPMorganChase’s delivery of products 
and services. These restrictions could also inhibit 
JPMorganChase’s development or marketing of 
certain products or services, or increase the costs of 
offering them to customers.
JPMorganChase’s operations, results and reputation 
could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary 
events beyond its control.
JPMorganChase’s business and operational systems 
could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could 
be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are 
wholly or partially beyond its control, including 
material instances of:
• cyber attacks
• security breaches of its physical premises, including 
threats to health and safety
• power, telecommunications or internet outages, or 
shutdowns of mass transit
• failure of, or loss of access to, technology or 
operational systems, including any resulting loss of 
critical data
• interruption of service from third-party service 
providers 
• damage to or loss of property or assets of 
JPMorganChase or third parties, and any 
consequent injuries, including in connection with any 
construction projects undertaken by 
JPMorganChase
• effects of climate change
• natural disasters or severe weather conditions
• accidents such as explosions or structural failures
• health emergencies, the spread of infectious 
diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or
• events arising from local or larger-scale civil or 
political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of 
hostilities, or terrorist acts.
JPMorganChase operates a Firmwide resiliency 
framework that is intended to enable it to prepare for 
and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and 
recover from, and address any adverse effects on its 
operations caused by, disruptions that may impact 
critical business functions and supporting assets, 
including its staff, technology, data and facilities and 
those of third-party service providers. 
Although not every form of disruption can be 
anticipated or defended against, JPMorganChase 
27
strives for resiliency or recovery in a range of scenarios 
in the event of a disruption, including due to the 
occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its 
control. There can be no assurance that 
JPMorganChase’s Firmwide resiliency framework will 
fully mitigate all potential resiliency risks to 
JPMorganChase, its clients, and customers and third 
parties with which it does business, or that its 
resiliency framework will be adequate to address the 
effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple or 
extended disruption events. In addition, 
JPMorganChase’s ability to respond effectively to a  
disruption event could be hampered to the extent that 
the members of its workforce, physical assets,  
systems and other support infrastructure, or those of 
its third-party service providers, that are needed to 
address the event are geographically dispersed, or 
conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in 
which they are concentrated. Further, should 
extraordinary events or the factors that cause or 
contribute to those events become more chronic, the 
disruptive effects of those events on JPMorganChase’s 
business and operations, and on its clients, customers, 
counterparties and employees, could become more 
significant and long-lasting. 
Any significant failure or disruption of 
JPMorganChase’s operations or operational systems, 
or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events 
that are beyond its control, could:
• hinder JPMorganChase’s ability to provide services 
to its clients and customers or to transact with its 
counterparties
• require it to expend significant resources to correct 
the failure or disruption or to address the event
• cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from 
loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or 
injuries
• disrupt market infrastructure systems on which 
JPMorganChase’s businesses rely 
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or 
other sanctions, and
• harm its reputation.
The occurrence of one or more extraordinary events 
could also negatively impact the financial condition or 
creditworthiness of JPMorganChase’s clients and 
customers, and could lead to an increase in 
delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit 
losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce 
JPMorganChase’s earnings.
Data quality is essential to JPMorganChase’s 
business and operations, and if JPMorganChase fails 
to maintain adequate data management processes, 
this could adversely affect its ability to effectively 
manage its businesses, comply with applicable laws, 
rules and regulations, or remain competitive. 
JPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and 
complete data to effectively operate its systems and 
processes, including:
• assessing risk exposures and limits
• monitoring and detecting fraudulent transactions 
and cyber threats
• developing or maintaining models and other 
analytical and judgment-based estimations, 
including those that use machine learning or artificial 
intelligence
• implementing and maintaining compliance 
programs, and
• preparing financial statements, disclosures and 
regulatory reports, as well as internal reporting
Any deficiencies in JPMorganChase’s data 
management processes, including with respect to the 
accuracy or completeness of data, the timeliness of 
data collection, the analysis or validation of data, or the 
safeguarding of data could undermine the reliability 
and effectiveness of its operations, including:
• risk management practices, including inaccurate or 
untimely risk reporting 
• delivery of regulatory reporting or internal or 
external financial reporting
• compliance practices, such as those relating to 
transaction monitoring, customer screening, 
blocking and rejecting transactions, recordkeeping 
or reporting
• business activities, such as those related to 
managing JPMorganChase's market-making 
positions and liquidity and capital levels, including 
reliance on timely data for informed decision-making
• providing services to clients and customers, 
including transaction processing, lending services, 
account management and customer support, or
• fraud detection and prevention processes.
Any or all of these factors could impair the ability of 
JPMorganChase to make sound business decisions, 
cause it to incur higher operational and compliance 
costs, result in operational breakdowns or failure to 
meet its regulatory requirements, negatively affect 
clients and customers, or lead to reputational harm.
Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the 
oversight of vendors and other service providers can 
result in higher costs and other potential exposures.
JPMorganChase must comply with enhanced 
regulatory and other standards associated with doing 
Part I
28
business with vendors and other service providers, 
including standards relating to the outsourcing of 
functions as well as the performance of significant 
banking and other functions by subsidiaries. 
JPMorganChase incurs significant costs and expenses 
in connection with its initiatives to address the risks 
associated with oversight of its internal and external 
service providers. JPMorganChase’s failure to 
appropriately assess and manage these relationships, 
especially those involving significant banking 
functions, shared services or other critical activities, 
could materially adversely affect JPMorganChase. 
Specifically, any such failure could result in:
• potential harm to clients and customers, and any 
liability associated with that harm
• regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions
• lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost 
revenues
• increased operational costs, or
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
JPMorganChase’s risk management framework and 
control environment will not be effective in 
identifying and mitigating every risk to 
JPMorganChase.
Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorganChase’s risk 
management framework, governance structure, 
practices, models or reporting systems, or in its 
control environment, could expose it to unexpected 
losses, and its financial condition or results of 
operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
Any such inadequacy or lapse could:
• hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to 
JPMorganChase’s senior management and Board of 
Directors
• lead to business decisions that have negative 
outcomes for JPMorganChase
• require significant resources and time to remediate
• lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations
• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny
• expose JPMorganChase to litigation, regulatory 
investigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other 
sanctions
• lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and 
any liability associated with that harm
• harm its reputation, or 
• otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorganChase.
Many of JPMorganChase’s risk management 
strategies and techniques consider historical market 
behavior and to some degree are based on 
management’s subjective judgment or assumptions. 
For example, many models used by JPMorganChase 
are based on assumptions regarding historical 
correlations among prices of various asset classes or 
other market indicators. In times of market stress, 
including difficult or less liquid market environments, 
or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, 
previously uncorrelated indicators may become 
correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated 
indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. 
Sudden market movements and unanticipated market 
or economic events could, in some circumstances, 
limit the effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s risk 
management strategies, causing it to incur losses.
JPMorganChase could recognize unexpected losses, 
its capital levels could be reduced and it could face 
greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations 
or judgments, including those used in its financial 
statements, are inadequate or incorrect.
JPMorganChase has developed and uses a variety of 
models and other analytical and judgment-based 
estimations to measure, monitor and implement 
controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, 
operational and other risks. JPMorganChase also uses 
internal models and estimations as a basis for its 
stress testing and in connection with the preparation 
of its financial statements under U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). 
These models and estimations are based on a variety 
of assumptions and historical trends, and are 
periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The 
models and estimations that JPMorganChase uses, 
including those that use machine learning or artificial 
intelligence, may not be effective in all cases to 
identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of 
factors, such as:
• reliance on historical trends that may not persist in 
the future, including assumptions underlying the 
models and estimations such as correlations among 
certain market indicators or asset prices
• inherent limitations associated with forecasting 
uncertain economic and financial outcomes
• historical trend information may be incomplete, or 
may not be indicative of severely negative market 
conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or 
lack of liquidity
• sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of 
certain loans and securities may make it more 
difficult to value certain financial instruments
• technology that is introduced to run models or 
estimations may not perform as expected, or may 
not be well understood by the personnel using the 
technology
• models and estimations may contain erroneous 
data, valuations, formulas or algorithms
• review processes may fail to detect flaws in models 
and estimations, and
29
• models may inadvertently incorporate biases 
present in data used in the models.
JPMorganChase may experience unexpected losses if 
models, estimates or judgments used or applied in 
connection with its risk management activities or the 
preparation of its financial statements are inadequate 
or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices 
are not available for certain financial instruments that 
require a determination of their fair value, 
JPMorganChase may make fair value determinations 
based on internally developed models or other means 
which ultimately rely to some degree on management 
estimates and judgment. In addition, JPMorganChase 
may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates 
if assets acquired differ from those used to develop 
those models, which may lead to unexpected losses.
Similarly, JPMorganChase establishes an allowance for 
expected credit losses related to its credit exposures 
which requires significant judgments, including 
forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might 
impair the ability of JPMorganChase’s clients and 
customers to repay their loans or other obligations. 
These types of estimates and judgments may not 
prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, 
including when the current and forecasted 
environments are significantly different from the 
historical environments upon which the models were 
developed. The increased uncertainty may necessitate 
a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform 
any adjustments that JPMorganChase may make to 
model outputs than would otherwise be the case.
Some of the models and other analytical and 
judgment-based estimations used by JPMorganChase 
in managing risks are subject to review by, and require 
the approval of, JPMorganChase’s regulators. These 
reviews are required before JPMorganChase may use 
those models and estimations for calculating market 
risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA 
under Basel III. If JPMorganChase’s models or 
estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may 
be subject to higher capital charges, which could 
adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability 
to expand its businesses. 
Lapses, weaknesses or deficiencies in controls over 
disclosure or financial reporting could materially 
affect JPMorganChase’s profitability or reputation.
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are 
subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and 
regulations, both within and outside the U.S., requiring 
continuous enhancements to various disclosures in its 
financial statements and regulatory reports.
There can be no assurance that JPMorganChase’s 
disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in 
every circumstance, or that a material weakness or 
significant deficiency in internal control over financial 
reporting will not occur. Any such lapse, weakness or 
deficiency could result in inaccurate financial reporting 
which, in turn, could:
• materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s 
business and results of operations or financial 
condition
• restrict its ability to access the capital markets 
• require it to expend significant resources to correct 
the lapse, weakness or deficiency
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or 
other sanctions
• harm its reputation, or 
• otherwise diminish investor confidence in 
JPMorganChase. 
Strategic
JPMorganChase’s results or competitive standing 
could suffer if its management fails to develop and 
execute effective business strategies, and to 
anticipate changes affecting those strategies.
The development and execution of effective business 
strategies by JPMorganChase’s management, along 
with the ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in 
the competitive environment, are critical to 
JPMorganChase's competitive standing and to 
achieving its strategic objectives. These strategies 
relate to:
• the products and services that JPMorganChase 
offers
• the geographies in which it operates
• the types of clients and customers that it serves
• the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests
• the counterparties with which it does business
• the technologies that it adopts or in which it invests, 
which may include new and currently unproven 
technologies, and
• the methods, distribution channels and third party 
service providers by or through which it offers 
products and services. 
If management makes choices about these strategies 
and goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on 
incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do 
not accurately assess the competitive landscape and 
industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory 
and market environments or the expectations of 
clients, customers, investors, employees and other 
stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth 
prospects of JPMorganChase’s businesses may suffer 
and its earnings could decline.
JPMorganChase’s growth prospects also depend on 
management’s ability to develop and execute effective 
business plans to address these strategic priorities, 
both in the near term and over longer time horizons. 
Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect 
Part I
30
JPMorganChase’s ability to develop and enhance its 
resources, control expenses and return capital to 
shareholders. Each of these objectives could be 
adversely affected by any failure on the part of 
management to:
• devise effective business plans and strategies
• offer products and services that meet changing 
expectations of clients and customers
• allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term 
stability to enable JPMorganChase to build and 
invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly 
stressed environment
• allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise 
modeling or subjective judgments made in 
connection with those allocations
• appropriately assess and monitor principal 
investments made to enhance or accelerate 
JPMorganChase's business strategies 
• conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective 
business acquisitions or investments, or effectively 
integrate newly-acquired businesses
• appropriately address concerns of clients, 
customers, investors, employees and other 
stakeholders, including with respect to climate and 
other ESG matters
• react quickly to changes in market conditions or 
market structures, or
• develop and enhance the operational, technology, 
risk, financial and managerial resources and 
capabilities necessary to grow and manage 
JPMorganChase’s businesses.
Furthermore, JPMorganChase may incur costs in 
connection with disposing of excess properties, 
premises and facilities, and those costs could be 
material to its results of operations.
JPMorganChase faces significant and increasing 
competition in the rapidly evolving financial services 
industry.
JPMorganChase operates in a highly competitive 
environment in which it must evolve and adapt to 
changes  in financial regulation, technological 
advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in 
economic conditions. JPMorganChase expects that 
competition in the U.S. and global financial services 
industry will continue to be intense. Competitors 
include:
• other banks and financial institutions
• trading, advisory and investment management firms
• finance companies
• technology companies, and
• other non-bank firms that are engaged in providing 
similar as well as new products and services.
JPMorganChase cannot provide assurance that the 
significant competition in the financial services 
industry will not materially and adversely affect its 
future results of operations. For example, aggressive 
or less disciplined lending practices by non-bank 
competitors could lead to a loss of market share for 
traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could 
result in instability in the financial services industry 
and adversely impact other market participants, 
including JPMorganChase.
New competitors in the financial services industry 
continue to emerge. For example, technological 
advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it 
possible for non-depository institutions to offer 
products and services that traditionally were banking 
products. These advances have also allowed financial 
institutions and other companies to provide electronic 
and internet-based financial solutions, including 
electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, 
lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, 
payments processing and online automated 
algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, 
both financial institutions and their non-banking 
competitors face the risk that payments processing 
and other products and services, including deposits 
and other traditional banking products, could be 
significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, 
such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using 
secure distributed ledgers, that may not require 
intermediation. New technologies have required and 
could require JPMorganChase to spend more to 
modify or adapt its products to attract and retain 
clients and customers or to match products and 
services offered by its competitors, including 
technology companies. In addition, new technologies 
may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated 
by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can 
increase JPMorganChase’s costs for complying with 
laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of 
products and services through those technologies and 
reduce the income that JPMorganChase earns from 
providing products and services through those 
technologies.
Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure 
on the pricing for JPMorganChase’s products and 
services or may cause JPMorganChase to lose market 
share, particularly with respect to traditional banking 
products. This competition may be based on quality 
and variety of products and services offered, 
transaction execution, innovation, reputation and 
price. The failure of any of JPMorganChase’s 
businesses to meet the expectations of clients and 
customers, whether due to general market conditions, 
under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular 
product or service, changes in client and customer 
expectations or other factors, could affect 
JPMorganChase’s ability to attract or retain clients and 
customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce 
31
JPMorganChase’s revenues. Increased competition 
also may require JPMorganChase to make additional 
capital investments in its businesses, or to extend 
more of its capital on behalf of its clients to remain 
competitive.
The effects of climate change could adversely affect 
JPMorganChase’s business and operations, both 
directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and 
customers.
JPMorganChase operates in many regions, countries 
and communities around the world where its business, 
and the activities of its clients and customers, could be 
adversely affected by climate change. Climate change 
could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorganChase 
either through changes in the physical climate or from 
the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon 
economy. Both physical risks and transition risks 
associated with climate change could have negative 
impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness 
of JPMorganChase’s clients and customers, on 
JPMorganChase's exposure to affected companies 
and markets, and on the effectiveness of 
JPMorganChase’s existing business strategy with 
respect to its operations, clients and customers.
Physical risks include the increased frequency or 
severity of acute weather events, such as floods, 
wildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts in 
the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent 
changes in precipitation levels, or increases in average 
ambient temperatures. Potential adverse impacts of 
climate-related physical risks to JPMorganChase, its 
clients or customers include:
• declines in asset values, including due to the 
destruction or degradation of property
• reduced availability or increased cost of insurance 
for clients of JPMorganChase
• interruptions to business operations, including 
supply chain disruption, and
• population migration or unemployment in affected 
regions.
Transition risks arise from the financial and economic 
consequences of society’s shift towards a lower-
carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, 
adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer 
preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. 
These risks could also be influenced by changes in the 
physical climate. Potential adverse impacts of 
transition risks to JPMorganChase, its clients or 
customers include:  
• sudden devaluation of assets, including 
unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)
• increased operational and compliance costs driven 
by changes in climate policy  
• increased energy costs driven by governmental 
actions and initiatives such as emission pricing and 
accelerated decarbonization policies
• negative consequences to business models, and the 
need to make changes in response to those 
consequences, and
• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation, including 
due to any perception that its business practices are 
contrary to public policy or the preferences of 
different stakeholders. 
Climate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and 
conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and 
financial regulations are implemented in the many 
regions where JPMorganChase operates, including 
initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation 
with extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal 
models and estimations used in climate risk 
assessments have an increased level of uncertainty 
due to limited historical trend information and the 
absence of standardized, reliable and comprehensive 
greenhouse gas emissions data, which could lead to 
inaccurate disclosures or financial reporting. 
Conduct
Conduct failure by JPMorganChase employees can 
harm clients and customers, impact market 
integrity, damage JPMorganChase’s reputation and 
trigger litigation and regulatory action.
JPMorganChase’s employees interact with clients, 
customers, counterparties and other market and 
industry participants, and with each other, every 
day. All employees are expected to demonstrate 
values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral 
part of JPMorganChase’s Code of Conduct and 
Business Principles. JPMorganChase endeavors to 
embed conduct risk management throughout an 
employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, 
training and development, and performance 
management. Conduct risk management is also an 
integral component of JPMorganChase’s promotion 
and compensation processes.
Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and 
practices, certain employees have engaged in 
improper or illegal conduct in the past. These 
instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and 
resolutions of governmental investigations or 
enforcement actions involving consent orders, 
deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution 
agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. 
There is no assurance that further inappropriate or 
unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or 
will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these 
resolutions (and associated consequences), or that 
any such actions will always be detected, deterred or 
prevented.
JPMorganChase’s reputation could be harmed by, and 
collateral consequences could result from, a failure by 
Part I
32
one or more employees to conduct themselves in 
accordance with JPMorganChase’s expectations, 
policies and practices, including by acting in ways that 
harm clients, customers, other market participants, 
employees or others. Some examples of this include:
• improperly selling and marketing JPMorganChase’s 
products or services
• engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or 
unauthorized trading
• engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in 
connection with government relief programs
• facilitating a transaction where a material objective 
is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial 
disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny 
by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where 
the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect 
the economic substance of the transaction
• failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties 
owed to clients or customers
• violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by 
colluding with other market participants
• using electronic communications channels that have 
not been approved by JPMorganChase
• engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment 
with respect to clients, customers or employees, or 
acting contrary to JPMorganChase’s goal of 
fostering an inclusive workplace
• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate 
JPMorganChase’s risk appetite to business 
performance goals or employee compensation 
objectives, and
• misappropriating property, confidential or 
proprietary information, or technology assets 
belonging to JPMorganChase, its clients and 
customers or third parties.
The consequences of any failure by one or more 
employees to conduct themselves in accordance with 
JPMorganChase’s expectations, policies or practices 
could include litigation, or regulatory or other 
governmental investigations or enforcement actions. 
Any of these proceedings or actions could result in 
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other 
sanctions, or lead to:
• financial losses
• increased operational and compliance costs
• greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties
• regulatory actions that require JPMorganChase to 
restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities
• the need for significant oversight by 
JPMorganChase’s management
• loss of clients or customers, and
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect 
to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorganChase fails 
to successfully integrate employees of those 
businesses or any of those employees do not conduct 
themselves in accordance with JPMorganChase's 
expectations, policies and practices.
Reputation
Damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation could harm 
its businesses.
Maintaining trust in JPMorganChase is critical to its 
ability to attract and retain clients, customers, 
investors and employees. Damage to 
JPMorganChase’s reputation can therefore cause 
significant harm to JPMorganChase’s business and 
prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, 
including:
• employee misconduct, including discriminatory 
behavior or harassment with respect to clients, 
customers or employees, or actions that are contrary 
to JPMorganChase’s goal of fostering an inclusive 
workplace
• security breaches, including as a result of cyber 
attacks
• failure to safeguard client, customer or employee 
information
• failure to manage risks associated with its client 
relationships, or with transactions or business 
activities in which JPMorganChase or its clients 
engage, including transactions or activities that may 
be unpopular among one or more constituencies
• rapid and broad dissemination of misinformation 
and disinformation across the media landscape, 
including social networking sites
• incorrect, biased or misleading results or content 
generated by artificial intelligence, leading to 
harmful outcomes, including discrimination in 
lending practices against vulnerable populations, 
fraud, manipulation of customers, privacy breaches 
or intellectual property infringement
• deficiencies or perceived failures in managing ESG-
related initiatives, including modifying or failing to 
meet publicly-announced targets
• operational failures
• litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other 
sanctions 
• actions taken in executing regulatory and 
governmental requirements during a global or 
regional health emergency, spread of infectious 
disease, epidemic or pandemic
• regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or 
resolutions of these matters, and 
• failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules 
or regulations by JPMorganChase or its clients, 
33
customers, counterparties or other parties, including 
newly-acquired businesses, companies in which 
JPMorganChase has made principal investments, 
parties to joint ventures with JPMorganChase, and 
vendors with which JPMorganChase does business.
Social and environmental activists have been targeting 
JPMorganChase and other financial services firms with 
public criticism concerning their business practices, 
including business relationships with clients that are 
engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as 
companies:
• whose products are or are perceived to be harmful 
to human health, or
• whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to 
negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or 
communities. 
Activists have also taken actions intended to change 
or influence JPMorganChase’s business practices with 
respect to ESG matters, including public protests at 
JPMorganChase’s headquarters and other properties, 
and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a 
vote by JPMorganChase’s shareholders.
In addition, JPMorganChase has been and expects that 
it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians 
and other members of the public concerning business 
practices or positions taken by JPMorganChase with 
respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, 
equity and inclusion initiatives) or regarding 
transactions or other business or interactions between 
JPMorganChase and governmental or regulatory 
bodies. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's relationships 
or ability to transact with clients and customers, and 
with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions 
in which JPMorganChase does business, could be 
adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing 
business with companies in certain sensitive industries 
are perceived to harm those companies or to align with 
particular political viewpoints. The foregoing types of 
criticism can be more widespread during election 
years in various jurisdictions, and could have the effect 
of focusing attention on a company such as 
JPMorganChase as part of a wider public debate on 
public policy matters. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's 
participation in or association with certain 
environmental and social industry groups or initiatives 
could be viewed by activists or governmental 
authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory 
business behavior.
These and other types of criticism and actions 
directed at JPMorganChase could potentially 
engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, 
investors, employees, government officials and other 
stakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorganChase’s 
reputation and its business and results of operations 
could be harmed by:
• greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory 
bodies, or further criticism from politicians and other 
members of the public, including in the form of 
governmental or regulatory investigations or 
litigation
• unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media, 
including through social media campaigns
• certain clients and customers ceasing doing 
business with JPMorganChase, and encouraging 
others to do so
• impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to attract 
new clients and customers, to expand its 
relationships with existing clients and customers, or 
to hire or retain employees, or
• certain investors opting to divest from investments 
in securities of JPMorganChase.
Actions by the financial services industry generally or 
individuals in the industry can also affect 
JPMorganChase’s reputation. For example, the 
reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged 
by concerns that:
• consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial 
institution, or
• a financial institution has acted inappropriately with 
respect to the methods used to offer products to 
customers.
If JPMorganChase is perceived to have engaged in 
these types of behaviors, this could weaken its 
reputation among clients or customers, employees or 
other stakeholders.
Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of 
interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result 
in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as 
damage JPMorganChase’s reputation.
JPMorganChase’s ability to manage potential conflicts 
of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of 
its business activities which encompass a variety of 
transactions, obligations and interests with and among 
JPMorganChase’s clients and customers. 
JPMorganChase can become subject to litigation, 
enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory 
scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the 
failure or perceived failure to:
• adequately address or appropriately disclose 
conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of 
interest that may arise in connection with providing 
multiple products and services in, or having one or 
more investments related to, the same transaction
• identify and address any conflict of interest that a 
third party with which it is does business may have 
with respect to a transaction involving 
JPMorganChase
• deliver appropriate standards of service and quality
Part I
34
• treat clients and customers fairly and with the 
appropriate standard of care
• use client and customer data responsibly and in a 
manner that meets legal requirements and 
regulatory expectations
• provide fiduciary products or services in accordance 
with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, 
or 
• handle or use confidential information of customers 
or clients appropriately and in compliance with 
applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules 
and regulations. 
A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address 
conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could 
result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and 
regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and 
heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement 
actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher 
operating costs and cause serious harm to 
JPMorganChase’s reputation.
Country
An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between 
countries or within a country or region could have a 
material adverse effect on the global economy and 
on JPMorganChase’s businesses within the affected 
region or globally. 
Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, 
including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, 
could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in 
other countries or escalating into full-scale war with 
potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if 
one or more of the combatants possess nuclear 
weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the 
hostilities could result in:
• worldwide economic disruption
• heightened volatility in financial markets
• severe declines in asset values, accompanied by 
widespread sell-offs of investments
• sudden increases in prices in the energy and 
commodity markets or for certain safe haven 
currencies
• substantial depreciation of local currencies, 
potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and 
counterparties in the affected region
• disruption of global trade
• diminished consumer, business and investor 
confidence
• refugee and humanitarian crises, and
• new economic sanctions or other regulatory 
requirements, including those that introduce 
exceptional compliance challenges for multinational 
companies such as JPMorganChase.
Any of the above consequences could have significant 
negative effects on JPMorganChase’s operations and 
earnings, both in the countries or regions directly 
affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the 
U.S. were to become directly involved in such a 
conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any 
operations that JPMorganChase may have in the 
affected countries or region, as well as in any nation 
that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. 
JPMorganChase could also experience more 
numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by 
or under the sponsorship of one or more of the 
adversaries in such a conflict.
JPMorganChase’s business and operations in certain 
countries can be adversely affected by local 
economic, political, regulatory and social factors.
Some of the countries in which JPMorganChase 
conducts business have economies or markets that 
are less developed and more volatile or may have 
political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less 
established or predictable than other countries in 
which JPMorganChase operates. In addition, in some 
jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase conducts 
business, the local economy and business activities 
are subject to substantial government influence or 
control. Some of these countries have in the past 
experienced economic disruptions, including:
• extreme currency fluctuations
• high inflation
• low or negative growth
• defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt 
and
• increased fraud or other misrepresentation of value.
The governments in these countries have sometimes 
reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive 
policies that adversely affect the local and regional 
business environment, such as:
• price, capital or exchange controls, including 
imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility 
restrictions or forced currency exchange
• expropriation or nationalization of assets, including 
client assets, or confiscation of property, including 
intellectual property, and
• changes in laws, rules and regulations. 
The impact of these actions could be accentuated in 
trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more 
volatile than more-developed markets. These types of 
government actions can negatively affect 
JPMorganChase’s operations in the relevant country, 
either directly or by suppressing the business 
activities of local clients or multi-national clients that 
conduct business in the jurisdiction. 
In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as 
more developed countries, have been susceptible to 
35
unfavorable social developments arising from poor 
economic conditions or governmental actions, 
including: 
• widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general 
strikes 
• crime and corruption
• security and personal safety issues
• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other 
geopolitical instabilities
• overthrow of incumbent governments
• terrorist attacks, and 
• other forms of internal discord. 
These economic, political, regulatory and social 
developments have in the past resulted in, and in the 
future could lead to, conditions that can adversely 
affect JPMorganChase’s operations in those countries 
and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of 
those operations. In addition, any of these events or 
circumstances in one country can affect 
JPMorganChase’s operations and investments in 
another country or countries, including in the U.S.
People
JPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain 
qualified employees is critical to its success.
JPMorganChase’s employees are its most important 
resource, and in many areas of the financial services 
industry, competition for qualified personnel is 
intense. JPMorganChase endeavors to attract talented  
new employees from a variety of backgrounds and 
retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. 
JPMorganChase's efforts to hire and retain talented  
employees could be hindered by factors such as:
• the emerging need for more-skilled workers in an 
evolving labor and workplace environment, 
including due to changes in technology
• targeted recruitment of JPMorganChase employees 
by competitors, and
• modifications to or discontinuation of 
JPMorganChase's hybrid work models.
JPMorganChase's performance and competitive 
position could be materially and adversely affected if it 
is unable to attract or retain qualified employees for its 
workforce or to devise and execute effective 
succession planning for key leadership roles, such as 
the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating 
Committee and other senior leaders.
In addition, advances in technology, such as 
automation and artificial intelligence, may lead to 
workforce displacement. This could require 
JPMorganChase to invest in additional employee 
training, manage impacts on morale and retention, and 
compete for employment candidates who possess 
more advanced technological skills, all of which could 
have a negative impact on JPMorganChase's business 
and operations. 
Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel 
policies could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s 
businesses and operations.
JPMorganChase relies on the skills, knowledge and 
expertise of employees located throughout the world. 
Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. 
and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise 
make it more difficult for employees or their family 
members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, 
jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase has operations 
or conducts its business could inhibit 
JPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified 
employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its 
workforce, or could prompt JPMorganChase to make 
structural changes to its worldwide or regional 
operating models that cause its operations to be less 
efficient or more costly.
Legal
JPMorganChase faces significant legal risks from 
litigation and formal and informal regulatory and 
government investigations.
JPMorganChase is named as a defendant or is 
otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, 
including class actions, derivative actions and other 
litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as 
criminal proceedings. Actions currently pending 
against JPMorganChase may result in judgments, 
settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions 
adverse to JPMorganChase. Any of these matters 
could materially and adversely affect 
JPMorganChase’s business, financial condition or 
results of operations, or cause serious reputational 
harm. As a participant in the financial services 
industry, it is likely that JPMorganChase will continue 
to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory 
and government investigations related to its 
businesses and operations.
Regulators and other government agencies conduct 
examinations of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries 
both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and 
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are 
subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This 
heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such 
an investigation or examination, may lead to additional 
regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. 
There is no assurance that those actions will not result 
in resolutions or other enforcement actions against 
JPMorganChase. Furthermore, a single event involving 
a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise 
to numerous and overlapping investigations and 
proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local 
agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, 
regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. 
jurisdictions.
Part I
36
In addition, if another financial institution violates a law 
or regulation relating to a particular business activity 
or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation 
by regulators and other governmental agencies of the 
same or similar activity or practice by JPMorganChase. 
JPMorganChase could become subject to a significant 
regulatory investigation and be unable to disclose 
specific information concerning that investigation to 
the public if such a disclosure would violate 
JPMorganChase’s obligations under applicable rules 
and regulations to maintain the confidentiality of 
confidential supervisory information, even if the 
resolution of that investigation could have a material 
adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s business, 
operations, results or financial condition.
Regulatory investigations, examinations or other 
initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental 
authorities may subject JPMorganChase to judgments, 
settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and 
may require JPMorganChase to restructure its 
operations and activities or to cease offering certain 
products or services. All of these potential outcomes 
could harm JPMorganChase’s reputation or lead to 
higher operational costs, thereby reducing 
JPMorganChase’s profitability, or result in collateral 
consequences. In addition, the extent of 
JPMorganChase’s exposure to legal and regulatory 
matters can be unpredictable and could, in some 
cases, exceed the amount of reserves that 
JPMorganChase has established for those matters.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
The internal control framework promulgated by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control — 
Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides 
guidance for designing, implementing and conducting 
internal control and assessing its effectiveness. The 
Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the 
effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Refer to 
“Management’s report on internal control over 
financial reporting” on page 168.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and 
with the participation of the Firm’s management, 
including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 
its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its 
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 
Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
concluded that these disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards 
of internal control over financial reporting. 
Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, 
internal control over financial reporting may not 
prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or 
lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, 
and there can be no assurance that any such 
deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or 
material weaknesses in internal control in the future 
and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to 
“Management’s report on internal control over 
financial reporting” on page 168 for further 
information.  There was no change in the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in 
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934) that occurred during the three months ended 
December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is 
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting.

Class B-1 common shares in exchange for a 
combination of Visa Class B-2 common shares and

resulting in a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa 
shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024. As of 
September 30, 2024, the Firm had disposed of all of its 
Visa C shares through sales and through a

prior-year period. Where meaningful to the results, this 
is referred to in this Form 10-K as the "timing impact" 
of First Republic. Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional 
information.
Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the 
full year of 2024 versus the full year of 2023, unless 
otherwise specified.
Firmwide overview
JPMorganChase reported net income of $58.5 billion 
for 2024, up 18%, earnings per share of $19.75, ROE of 
18% and ROTCE of 22%.
• Total net revenue was $177.6 billion, up 12%, 
reflecting: 
– Net interest income (“NII”) of $92.6 billion, up 4%, 
driven by the impact of balance sheet actions, 
primarily reinvestments in the investment 
securities portfolio, higher revolving balances in 
Card Services, the timing impact of First Republic, 
higher wholesale deposit balances, and higher 
Markets net interest income, largely offset by 
deposit margin compression across the lines of 
business and lower average deposit balances in 
CCB. NII excluding Markets was $92.4 billion, up 
3%. 
– Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $85.0 billion, up 
23%, predominantly driven by a $7.9 billion net 
gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024, higher asset management fees in 
AWM and CCB, higher investment banking fees, 
and lower net investment securities losses in 
Treasury and CIO.
The prior year included the estimated bargain 
purchase gain of $2.8 billion associated with First 
Republic.
54
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
• Noninterest expense was $91.8 billion, up 5%, driven 
by higher compensation expense, including higher 
revenue-related compensation and growth in the 
number of employees, as well as a $1.0 billion 
contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase 
Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024, 
partially offset by lower FDIC-related expense, 
reflecting a $2.9 billion special assessment 
recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared 
with a $725 million increase to the FDIC special 
assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024. 
• The provision for credit losses was $10.7 billion, 
reflecting $8.6 billion of net charge-offs and a net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses of $2.0 
billion. Net charge-offs increased by $2.4 billion, 
driven by Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of 
vintages originated in recent years, credit 
normalization, and balance growth. The net addition 
to the allowance for credit losses included a net 
addition of $2.1 billion in consumer, driven by Card 
Services, and a net reduction of $19 million in 
wholesale.
The provision in the prior year was $9.3 billion, 
reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a $3.1 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses.
• The total allowance for credit losses was $26.9 
billion at December 31, 2024. The Firm had an 
allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage 
ratio of 1.87%, compared with 1.75% in the prior year.
• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.3 
billion at December 31, 2024, up 22%, driven by 
higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected 
downgrades in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, 
partially offset by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, 
which included loan sales. Refer to Wholesale Credit 
Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 
126–136 and pages 120–125, respectively, for 
additional information.
• Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 6%, 
driven by higher loans across the lines of business. 
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 
1%, reflecting:
– net inflows in Payments and net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets,
– the timing impact of First Republic, and
– growth in balances in new and existing client 
accounts in AWM,
predominantly offset by
– a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–
115 for additional information.
Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $275.5 billion, and the 
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.7% 
and 15.8%, respectively.
• SLR was 6.1%.
• TBVPS grew 13.0%, ending 2024 at $97.30.
• As of December 31, 2024, the Firm had eligible end-
of-period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of 
approximately $834 billion and unencumbered 
marketable securities with a fair value of 
approximately $594 billion, resulting in 
approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer 
to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for 
additional information.
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and 
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 59–62 
and pages 63–65, respectively, for a further discussion 
of the Firm's results, including the provision for credit 
losses, and Note 34 for additional information on the 
First Republic acquisition.
Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR 
excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a 
managed basis are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 67–69 
for a further discussion of each of these measures.

2024 compared with 2023
Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB 
the benefit of favorable market conditions, which 
resulted in:
• higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven 
by higher industry-wide issuances in leveraged 
loans, and in high-grade and high-yield bonds, 
• higher equity underwriting fees driven by higher 
industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in IPOs, 
and in follow-on and convertible securities offerings, 
and
• higher advisory fees driven by higher industry-wide 
mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity and wallet 
share gains.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 77–83 and Note 
6 for additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased driven by 
CIB, reflecting:
• higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and 
Equity Derivatives,
predominantly offset by
• lower Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting the 
net impact of declines in revenue across macro 
businesses and higher revenue in Securitized 
Products.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has 
offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance 
of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.
The increase in CIB was partially offset by a net 
decrease in Corporate, reflecting lower revenue in 
Treasury and CIO, and gains compared with a net loss 
on certain legacy private equity investments in the 
prior year.
Refer to CIB segment and Corporate results on pages 
77–83 and pages 88–90, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, 
reflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees, including 
cash management fees in Payments, on higher 
volume; and higher lending-related fees, including loan 
commitment fees. These factors were largely offset by 
a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount 
on certain acquired lending-related commitments 
associated with First Republic, primarily in AWM, as 
certain of the commitments have expired. 
Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 77–
83 and pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Asset management fees increased, reflecting, in 
AWM and CCB, higher average market levels and net 
inflows, as well as higher performance fees in AWM; 
and in CCB, the timing impact of First Republic. Refer 
to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 73–76 and 
pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
59
Commissions and other fees increased, 
predominantly due to higher brokerage commissions 
and fees on higher volume, and higher custody fees, in 
both CIB and AWM, as well as higher annuity sales 
commissions in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM 
segment results on pages 73–76, pages 77–83 and 
pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 
Investment securities losses decreased, reflecting 
lower losses on sales of securities, primarily U.S. 
Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, 
associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to 
Corporate results on pages 88–90 and Note 10 for 
additional information.
Mortgage fees and related income increased in Home 
Lending, reflecting higher production revenue, which 
included the timing impact of First Republic. Refer to 
CCB segment results on pages 73–76, and Note 6 and 
15 for additional information.
Card income increased, reflecting higher net 
interchange on increased debit and credit card sales 
volume, as well as higher annual fees in CCB, partially 
offset by an increase in amortization related to new 
account origination costs. Refer to CCB segment 
results on pages 73–76 and Note 6 for additional 
information.
Other income increased, reflecting: 
• in Corporate: 
– the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares 
recorded in the second quarter of 2024,
partially offset by
– the absence of the prior-year $2.8 billion 
estimated bargain purchase gain associated with 
the First Republic acquisition, and 
• in CIB:
– the impact of the adoption of updates to the 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures guidance effective January 1, 2024, 
resulting in the amortization of certain of the 
Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments 
previously recognized in other income which is 
now recognized in income tax expense.
Both periods included impairment losses related to 
certain equity investments. 
The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the 
original minority interest in China International Fund 
Management ("CIFM"), partially offset by net 
investment valuation losses, both in AWM.
Refer to AWM segment results on pages 84–87 for 
additional information on CIFM; Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 
for additional information on the adoption of updates 
to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures guidance; Notes 2 and 6 for additional 
information on Visa shares; and Notes 6 and 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition.
Net interest income increased driven by the impact of 
balance sheet actions, primarily reinvestments in the 
investment securities portfolio, higher revolving 
balances in Card Services, the timing impact of First 
Republic, higher wholesale deposit balances and 
higher Markets net interest income. These factors 
were largely offset by deposit margin compression 
across the lines of business and lower average deposit 
balances in CCB.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5 
trillion, up $212 billion, and the yield was 5.50%, up 36 
bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, 
was 2.63%, a decrease of 7 bps. The net yield 
excluding Markets was 3.84%, relatively flat when 
compared to the prior year.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, 
interest and rates schedule on pages 322–326 for 
additional information. Net yield excluding Markets is a 
non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and 
Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures on pages 67–69 for an additional 
discussion of net yield excluding Markets.

2024 compared with 2023 
The provision for credit losses was $10.7 billion, 
reflecting $8.6 billion of net charge-offs and a $2.0 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses. 
Net charge-offs included $7.8 billion in consumer,  
predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting the 
seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, credit 
normalization and balance growth, and $0.8 billion in 
wholesale, primarily in Real Estate, largely 
concentrated in Office.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
consisted of:
• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting:
– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, 
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting 
higher revolving balances, including the seasoning 
of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and 
• a net reduction of $19 million in wholesale, 
reflecting: 
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by 
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024. 
The provision in the prior year was $9.3 billion, 
reflecting net charge-offs of $6.2 billion and a $3.1 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, 
which included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance 
for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.

2024 compared with 2023
Compensation expense increased driven by:
• higher revenue-related compensation across the 
LOBs,
• growth in the number of employees across the LOBs 
and Corporate, primarily in front office and 
technology, and
• the impact of First Republic, predominantly in CCB, 
reflecting timing and the classification of the prior-
year expense, which was recognized in other 
expense in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023 
as the individuals associated with First Republic 
were not employees of the Firm until July 2023.
Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of:
• lower FDIC-related expense recognized in 
Corporate, which included the impact of a $2.9 
billion special assessment recognized in the fourth 
quarter of 2023, compared with a $725 million 
increase to the FDIC special assessment recognized 
in the first quarter of 2024, and
• lower legal expense, reflecting the net impact of 
declines in CCB, CIB and Corporate, and an increase 
in AWM,
predominantly offset by
• a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the 
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024 in Corporate,
• higher investments in technology in the businesses, 
as well as marketing, predominantly in CCB,
• higher occupancy expense, which included the 
impact of net additions to the Firm's properties,
• higher distribution fees in AWM and brokerage 
expense in CIB, and
• the timing impact associated with First Republic, 
offset by the alignment of expense to compensation 
expense, as noted above.

Visa shares; Note 6 for additional information on other 
expense; and Note 34 for additional information on the

Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.
2024 compared with 2023 
The effective tax rate increased predominantly driven 
by:
• the adoption of updates to the Accounting for 
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on 
January 1, 2024, and
• a higher level of pretax income and changes in the 
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, 
state and local taxes, including the impact of the net 
gain on Visa shares and the contribution of Visa 
shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded 
in the second quarter of 2024.
The prior year included the impact to income tax 
expense associated with the First Republic acquisition 
that was reflected in the estimated bargain purchase 
gain, and an income tax benefit related to the 
finalization of certain income tax regulations, both of 
which resulted in a reduction in the Firm's effective tax 
rate.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
decreased driven by higher investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO, and Markets activities in CIB.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting higher client-driven market-making 
activities.
Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting a higher demand for securities to cover 
short positions.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading assets increased predominantly due to higher 
levels of debt and equity instruments in Markets 
related to client-driven market-making activities. Refer 
to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities increased due to:
• higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities, reflecting 
net purchases, primarily U.S. Treasuries and non-
U.S. government debt securities, partially offset by 
maturities and paydowns, and
• lower held to-maturity (“HTM”) securities driven by 
maturities and paydowns.
Refer to Corporate results on pages 88–90, 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 140, 
and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• higher outstanding balances in Card Services driven 
by growth in new accounts and normalization of 
revolving balances,
• higher wholesale loans in CIB, and
• higher securities-based lending in AWM due to 
higher client demand,
partially offset by
• a decline in Home Lending as paydowns and loan 
sales outpaced originations.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a 
net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $1.9 
billion, consisting of:
• $2.1 billion net addition in consumer, primarily in 
Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth, 
reflecting higher revolving balances, including the 
seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by a net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and
• a net reduction of $176 million in wholesale, 
reflecting:
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
63
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
There was also a $128 million net addition to the 
allowance for lending-related commitments 
recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. 
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit 
and Investment Risk Management on pages 59–62 
and pages 117–140, respectively, Critical Accounting 
Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 161–164, and 
Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional information on loans 
and the total allowance for credit losses. 
Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased 
primarily driven by lower receivables in Payments 
related to the timing of processing payment activities, 
due to December 31, 2023 falling on a weekend, as well 
as lower client receivables related to client-driven 
activities in Markets. 
Premises and equipment increased primarily as a 
result of the construction-in-process associated with 
the Firm's headquarters, and purchases of properties. 
Refer to Notes 16 and 18 for additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles: Refer to Note 
15 for additional information.
Other assets increased primarily due to higher cash 
collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCP") in 
Markets, the impact of the adoption of updates to the 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures 
guidance effective January 1, 2024, and higher auto 
operating lease assets in CCB. Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14

Deposits increased, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly 
in Payments, largely offset by net maturities of 
structured notes in Markets,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances 
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely 
offset by continued migration into other 
investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending and migration into higher-
yielding investments, predominantly offset by new 
accounts.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements increased driven 
by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-
making activities and higher secured financing of 
trading assets.
Short-term borrowings increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting net issuance of structured notes due to 
client demand, and higher financing requirements.

for additional information on deposits, federal funds 
purchased and securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; 
Notes 2 and 17 for deposits; and Note 11 for federal 
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements.
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven 
market-making activities primarily in Fixed Income 
Markets, which resulted in higher levels of short 
positions in debt instruments. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 
for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased 
primarily driven by lower payables in Payments related 
to the timing of processing payment activities, due to 
December 31, 2023 falling on a weekend, as well as 
lower client payables related to client-driven activities 
in Markets, partially offset by the impact of the 
adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments 
in Tax Credit Structures guidance effective January 1, 
2024. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on 
accounts payable; and Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for 
additional information on updates to the accounting 
guidance.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 
increased driven by the issuance of credit card 
securitizations in Treasury and CIO, and activity in 
municipal bond vehicles in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115; 
and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on 
Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt  increased, primarily driven by:
• net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to 
client demand,
partially offset by
• a decline in Treasury and CIO, reflecting the net 
impact of lower FHLB advances and higher long-
term debt from net issuances.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 
and Note 34 for additional information on the First 
Republic acquisition.
Stockholders’ equity increased, reflecting:
• net income,
largely offset by 
• the impact of capital actions, including repurchases 
of common shares, the declaration of common and 
preferred stock dividends, and net redemption of 
preferred stock, and 
• net unrealized losses in AOCI, including the impact 
of higher interest rates on cash flow hedges in 
Treasury and CIO.

Operating activities 
JPMorganChase’s operating assets and liabilities 
primarily support the Firm’s lending and capital 
markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary 
significantly in the normal course of business due to 
the amount and timing of cash flows, which are 
affected by client-driven and risk management 
activities and market conditions. The Firm believes 
that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate 
cash through secured and unsecured sources, are 
sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading 
assets and higher securities borrowed, largely offset 
by net income. 
• In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net 
income, lower other assets, and accrued interest and 
accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher 
trading assets, lower accounts payable and other 
liabilities, and higher securities borrowed.
Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the 
investment securities portfolio and other short-term 
instruments.
• In 2024, cash used resulted from net purchases of 
investment securities, net loan originations and 
higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements, partially offset by proceeds from sales 
and securitizations of loans held-for-investment. 
• In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds 
from investment securities, proceeds from sales and 
securitizations of loans held-for-investment, and 
lower securities purchased under resale 
agreements, largely offset by net originations of 
loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank 
acquisition.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring 
customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and 
preferred stock.
• In 2024, cash provided primarily reflected higher 
securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-
term borrowings, partially offset by net redemption 
of preferred stock.
• In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which 
included the impact of the repayment of the 
deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the 
consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm 
assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, 
partially offset by higher securities loaned under 
repurchase agreements and net proceeds from 
long- and short-term borrowings.
• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these 
financial statements appear on pages 172–176. That 
presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, 
provides the reader with an understanding of the 
Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from 
year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s 
performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements 
of other companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a 
reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, 
including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; 
these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP 
financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results 
of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with 
the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm as a whole, and for each of the reportable 
business segments and Corporate, on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures 
allow management to assess the comparability of 
revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable 
and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income 
tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded 
within income tax expense. These adjustments have 
no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a 
whole or by each of the lines of business and 
Corporate.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment levels 
because these other non-GAAP financial measures 
provide information to investors about the underlying 
operational performance and trends of the Firm or of 
the particular business segment, as the case may be, 
and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the 
business segment with the performance of its relevant 
competitors. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate 
Results on pages 70–90 for additional information on 
these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial 
measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to 
similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other companies. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed 
basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest 
revenue excluding Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, 
and noninterest revenue on a managed basis, 
management also reviews these metrics excluding 
Markets, as shown below. Markets consists of CIB’s 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These 
metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP 
financial measures. Management reviews these 
metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s 
lending, investing (including asset-liability 
management) and deposit-raising activities, apart 
from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In 
addition, management also assesses Markets 
business performance on a total revenue basis as 
offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management 
believes that these measures provide investors and 
analysts with alternative measures to analyze the 
revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial 
measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are 
calculated as follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at 
period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP 
measures such as:
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest 
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense, and
• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net 
revenue less total noninterest expense.
Management believes that these measures help 
investors to understand the effect of these items on 
reported results and provide an alternative 
presentation of the Firm’s performance.
68
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ 
equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other 
than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common 
equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares 
at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the 
Firm’s use of equity.

BUSINESS SEGMENT & CORPORATE RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable 
business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business 
segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the 
reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & 
Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. 
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, 
whose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a 
managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on 
pages 67–69 for a definition of managed basis.
The following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the reportable business segments are 
intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-
alone business. The management reporting process 
that derives business segment results includes the 
allocation of certain income and expense items. The 
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements 
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also 
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on 
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide 
various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm 
and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance.
Revenue sharing 
When business segments or businesses within each 
segment join efforts to sell products and services to 
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating 
businesses may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or 
service, with allocations to the other segments or 
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment 
and business results reflect these revenue-sharing 
agreements.
70
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
Corporate support units, or another business segment, 
the costs of those services are allocated to the 
respective business segments. The expense is 
generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of 
services provided. In contrast, certain costs and 
investments related to Corporate that are not currently 
utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business 
segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were stand-
alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned 
with a particular reportable business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which 
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the 
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary 
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the 
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets 
and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. 
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions 
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect 
economic conditions and other factors, which may 
impact the allocation of net interest income to the 
segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the 
Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer 
deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding 
benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that 
is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s 
net interest income.
As a result of higher average interest rates, the cost of 
funds for assets and the FTP benefit earned for 
liabilities have generally increased in the current year, 
impacting the net interest income of the business 
segments. During the period ended December 31, 
2024, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds for 
loans and Markets activities. In addition, rates paid to 
deposit holders increased more than the FTP benefit 
increase during the year, resulting in deposit margin 
compression.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs 
and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain 
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages 
these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign 
exchange rate movements related to the transferred 
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on 
page 149 for additional information.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the 
credit spread component of outstanding unsecured 
long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while 
the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-
term debt and preferred stock dividends to the 
business segments is aligned with the relevant 
regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of 
the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of 
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business 
segment’s net interest income, and net income is 
reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 
97–107 for additional information.
Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and 
Corporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current 
equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the 
global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) 
surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well 
as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital 
are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to 
the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of 
business and Corporate equity on page 104 for 
additional information on capital allocation.

        2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $17.6 billion, down 17%.
Net revenue was $71.5 billion, up 2%.
Net interest income was $54.9 billion, flat when 
compared with the prior year, reflecting:
• lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"), 
predominantly driven by deposit margin 
compression and lower average deposits,
offset by
• higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by 
higher revolving balances, and
• the timing impact of First Republic in Home Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 10%, 
predominantly driven by:
• higher asset management fees reflecting higher 
average market levels, including the timing impact 
of First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net inflows, 
as well as higher commissions from annuity sales in 
BWM,
• higher card income, driven by higher net 
interchange reflecting increased debit and credit 
card sales volume, and higher annual fees, partially 
offset by an increase in amortization related to new 
account origination costs, as well as
• higher production revenue in Home Lending, 
including the timing impact of First Republic. 
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card 
income, asset management fees, and commissions 
and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on 
pages 161–164 for additional information on the credit 
card rewards liability. 
Refer to Executive Overview on page 54 and Note 34 
for additional information on First Republic.
Noninterest expense was $38.0 billion, up 9%, 
reflecting First Republic-related expense that was 
aligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third 
quarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and 
noncompensation expense.
The increase in expense also reflected:
• higher compensation expense, largely driven by 
higher revenue-related compensation 
predominantly for advisors and bankers, and an 
increase in the number of employees, including in 
technology, and
• higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by 
continued investments in technology and marketing, 
as well as higher operating losses, partially offset by 
lower legal expense.
The provision for credit losses was $10.0 billion, 
reflecting:
• net charge-offs of $7.9 billion, up $2.6 billion, 
including $2.4 billion in Card Services, reflecting the 
seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, 
credit normalization and balance growth, and
• a $2.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, consisting of:
– $2.2 billion in Card Services, predominantly driven 
by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving 
balances, including the seasoning of vintages 
originated in recent years,
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending, 
primarily due to improvements in the outlook for 
home prices in the first quarter of 2024. 
The provision in the prior year was $6.9 billion, 
reflecting net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, a $1.2 billion 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, 
predominantly driven by Card Services, and a $408 
million net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans 
and lending-related commitments in the second 
quarter of 2023.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on 
pages 117–140 and Allowance for Credit Losses on 
pages 137–139 for a further discussion of the credit 
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $24.8 billion, up 23%.
Net revenue was $70.1 billion, up 9%.
Banking & Payments revenue was $35.3 billion, up 11%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $9.6 billion, up 
36%. Investment Banking fees were up 37%, driven 
by higher fees across products. The Firm ranked #1 
for Global Investment Banking fees, according to 
Dealogic.
– Debt underwriting fees were $4.1 billion, up 55%, 
predominantly driven by higher industry-wide 
issuances in leveraged loans, and in high-grade 
and high-yield bonds.
– Equity underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, up 47%, 
driven by increased industry-wide fees and wallet 
share gains in IPOs, and in follow-on and 
convertible securities offerings.
– Advisory fees were $3.3 billion, up 17%, driven by 
increased industry-wide M&A activity and wallet 
share gains.
• Payments revenue was $18.1 billion, up 1%, driven by 
fee growth on higher volumes as well as higher 
average deposits, predominantly offset by deposit 
margin compression, reflecting higher rates paid, 
and higher deposit-related client credits. 
• Lending revenue was $7.5 billion, up 8%, 
predominantly driven by the impacts of higher rates 
and the First Republic acquisition.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $34.8 
billion, up 7%. Markets revenue was $30.0 billion, up 
7%.
• Equity Markets revenue was $9.9 billion, up 13%, 
driven by higher revenue in Equity Derivatives and 
Prime Finance.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $20.1 billion, up 
5%, driven by higher revenue in the Securitized 
Products Group, Currencies & Emerging Markets, 
and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates 
and Commodities. 
• Securities Services revenue was $5.1 billion, up 7%, 
predominantly driven by fee growth on higher client 
activity and market levels.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $244 
million, compared with a loss of $280 million in the 
prior year.
Noninterest expense was $35.4 billion, up 4%, driven 
by higher compensation expense,  including revenue-
related compensation and an increase in the number 
of employees, as well as higher technology and 
brokerage expense partially offset by lower legal 
expense.
The provision for credit losses was $762 million, 
reflecting: 
• net charge-offs of $617 million, primarily in Real 
Estate, largely concentrated in Office, and
• a $145 million net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, driven by
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm's modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024, 
predominantly offset by
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
predominantly from collateral-dependent loans. 
The provision in the prior year was $2.1 billion, 
reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses, which included $608 million to establish 
the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-
related commitments in the second quarter of 2023, 
and net charge-offs of $588 million.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income 
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets 
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity 
Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal 
transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as 
well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its 
Markets business performance on a total revenue 
basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net 
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives 
that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions 
revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the 
composition of these income statement line items. 
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise 
from client-driven market-making activity. Principal 
transactions revenue includes amounts recognized 
upon executing new transactions with market 
participants, as well as “inventory-related revenue,” 
which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on 
derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has 
been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client 
demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions 
revenue recognized upon executing new transactions 
with market participants is affected by many factors 
including the level of client activity, the bid-offer 
spread (which is the difference between the price at 
which a market participant is willing and able to sell an 
instrument to the Firm and the price at which another 
market participant is willing and able to buy it from the 
Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and 
volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive 
to the same factors that drive inventory-related 
revenue, which include general market conditions, 
such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit 
spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as 
other macroeconomic conditions.

(a) The decline in Equity Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.
(b) Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets recorded losses in 
total net revenue, which includes revenue related to both trading and non-trading positions. The loss days determined under this measure 
differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s 
Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may more than offset 
backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on 
pages 143–145.
(c) In the fourth quarter of 2024, certain net funding costs that were previously allocated to Fixed Income Markets were reclassified to Equity 
Markets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Includes the amortization of the fair value discount on certain 
acquired lending-related commitments associated with First 
Republic. The discount is deferred in other liabilities and 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period 
and was largely recognized in 2023 as the commitments were 
generally short term. Refer to Note 34 for additional information.
(b) Includes the gain on the original minority interest in CIFM upon 
the Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.
2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $5.4 billion, up 4%.
Net revenue was $21.6 billion, up 9%. Net interest 
income was $6.6 billion, up 5%. Noninterest revenue 
was $15.0 billion, up 11%.
Revenue from Asset Management was $10.2 billion, up 
11%, driven by: 
• higher asset management fees, reflecting higher 
average market levels and strong net inflows, as well 
as
• higher performance fees.
The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the 
original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s 
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.
Revenue from Global Private Bank was $11.4 billion, up 
7%, driven by: 
• higher noninterest revenue, reflecting:
– higher management fees on strong net inflows and 
higher average market levels, as well as higher 
brokerage fees, 
partially offset by
– a decline in the amortization of the fair value 
discount on certain acquired lending-related 
commitments associated with First Republic that 
have expired, and
• higher net interest income driven by:
– higher average deposits associated with First 
Republic, which were transferred to AWM from 
CCB in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as wider 
spreads on loans and higher average loans, 
largely offset by
– deposit margin compression reflecting higher 
rates paid.
The prior year included net investment valuation 
losses. 
Noninterest expense was $14.4 billion, up 13%, 
predominantly driven by:
• higher compensation, including revenue-related 
compensation, and continued growth in private 
banking advisor teams, and
• higher distribution fees and legal expense,
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $68 
million. 
The provision in the prior year was $159 million, 
reflecting a $146 million addition to the allowance for 
credit losses to establish the allowance for the First 
Republic loans and lending-related commitments in 
the second quarter of 2023.

Asset Management has two high-level measures 
of its overall fund performance.
• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 
management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating 
services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance 
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star 
rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. 
A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An 
overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of 
the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- 
year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the 
individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based 
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer 
than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded 
from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories 
and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced 
from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the 
fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. 
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the 
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary 
share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, 
except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund 
level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.
• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 
management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, 
three and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings 
are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings 
are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where 
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values 
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund 
performance and associated peer rankings at the share class 
level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong 
Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The 
performance data may have been different if all share classes 
had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future 
results.
“Primary share class” means the C share class for European 
funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan 
funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share 
class is used as the primary share class.

(f) Included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for 
the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the First 
Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional 
information.
(g) In the second quarter of 2023, substantially all of the expense 
associated with First Republic was reported in Corporate. 
Commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the expense was 
aligned to the appropriate LOBs.
(h) Income taxes associated with the First Republic acquisition were 
reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain.

2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $10.6 billion, compared with $2.8 
billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $17.4 billion, compared with $8.0 
billion in the prior year.
Net interest income was $9.8 billion, up 24%, driven by 
the impact of balance sheet actions, primarily  
reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, 
partially offset by the net impact of rates. 
Noninterest revenue was $7.6 billion, compared with 
$132 million in the prior year. Excluding the $7.9 billion 
net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024 and the prior-year $2.8 billion 
estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the 
First Republic acquisition, revenue was up $2.4 billion, 
predominantly driven by lower investment securities 
losses, primarily on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS, associated with 
repositioning the investment securities portfolio in 
Treasury and CIO. 
Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, down 29%, 
driven by: 
• a lower FDIC special assessment,
• lower expense associated with the First Republic 
acquisition as the prior year expense in Corporate 
included individuals associated with First Republic 
who were not employees of the Firm until July 2023, 
and this expense was subsequently aligned to the 
appropriate LOBs starting in the third quarter of 
2023, and
• lower legal expense, 
partially offset by
• a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the 
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024, and
• higher costs associated with the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives. 
The provision for credit losses was $10 million.
The provision in the prior year was $171 million, 
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses related to a single name exposure, which was 
subsequently charged off upon the restructuring of a 
loan.
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information 
on the investment securities portfolio and the 
allowance for credit losses.
The current period income tax expense was driven by 
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses 
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, 
including the impact of the net gain on Visa shares and 
the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase 
Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024, 
partially offset by benefits related to tax audit 
settlements.
Other Corporate includes the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives, which primarily consists of Chase 
U.K., Nutmeg, and an ownership stake in C6 Bank.
The deposits within Corporate relate to the Firm’s 
international consumer initiatives and have increased 
as a result of growth in client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of additional product offerings.

Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the 
Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate 
and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by 
Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken 
by the Firm’s three reportable business segments to 
serve their respective client bases, which generate 
both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.
Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-
liability management objectives generally by investing 
in high quality securities that are managed for the 
longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to 
meet the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives. 
Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. 
In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm’s cash 
position primarily through deposits at central banks 
and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for 
further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer 
to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149 for 
information on interest rate and foreign exchange 
risks.
The investment securities portfolio predominantly 
consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, 
U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency 
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan 
obligations, obligations of U.S. states and 
municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2024, 
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, 
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $678.3 
billion, and the average credit rating of the securities 
comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon 
external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). 
Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk 
ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or 
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their 
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or 
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on 
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to 
manage its business, and the associated risks, in a 
manner that balances serving the interests of its 
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the 
safety and soundness of the Firm. 
The Firm believes that effective risk management 
requires, among other things:  
• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification 
and escalation of risks by all individuals within the 
Firm;  
• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data 
and management within each of the LOBs and 
Corporate; and 
• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced 
compensation framework with strong internal 
governance and independent oversight by the Board 
of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and 
control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s 
performance evaluation and incentive compensation 
processes. 
Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves 
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks and 
impacts of risks. 
Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. 
Drivers of risks include the economic environment, 
regulatory or government policy, competitor or market 
evolution, business decisions, process or judgment 
error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets 
and natural disasters.
Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized 
in the following four risk types: 
•
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, 
liquidity or reputation associated with poorly-
designed or failed business plans or an inadequate 
response to changes in the operating environment. 
• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with 
the default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, 
including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk 
and investment portfolio risk. 
• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors, such as interest and 
foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity 
prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the 
value of assets and liabilities held for both the short 
and long term. 
• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external 
events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. 
Operational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, 
conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both 
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many 
consequences when risks manifest themselves, 
including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in 
earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or 
penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the 
Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and 
regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on 
a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk 
Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of 
Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval 
by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the 
“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer 
(“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk 
governance framework of the Firm. The framework is 
subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee 
through its review and approval of the Risk 
Governance and Oversight Policy.
The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to 
the Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk 
Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and 
the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in 
turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance 
organizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance 
policies and standards, and define and oversee the 
implementation of the Firm’s risk governance 
framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in 
their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks 
that span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as 
functions and regions. Each area of the Firm that gives 
rise to risk is expected to operate within the 
parameters identified by the IRM function, and within 
the risk and control standards established by its own 
management. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
91
Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: 
The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury 
and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, 
including their aligned Operations, Technology and 
Control Management. The first line of defense owns 
the risks, and identification of risks, associated with 
their respective activities and the design and 
execution of controls to manage those risks. 
Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable 
laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the 
risk governance framework established by IRM, which 
may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and 
controls. 
The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is 
separate from the first line of defense and is 
responsible for independently measuring risk, as well 
as assessing and challenging the risk management 
activities of the first line of defense. IRM is also 
responsible for the identification of risks within its 
organization, its own adherence to applicable laws, 
rules and regulations and for the development and 
implementation of policies and standards with respect 
to its own processes. 
The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an 
independent function that provides objective 
assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of 
Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk 
management. The Internal Audit function is led by the 
General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee 
and administratively to the CEO.
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to 
the Firmwide control environment but are not 
considered part of a particular line of defense, 
including Corporate Finance, Human Resources and 
Legal. These other functions are responsible for the 
identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and implementation of the risk governance 
framework established by IRM.
Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, as well as the design and execution of 
controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage 
those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk 
identification framework designed to facilitate the 
responsibility of each LOB and Corporate to identify 
material risks inherent to the Firm’s businesses and 
operational activities, catalog them in a central 
repository and review material risks on a regular basis. 
The IRM function reviews and challenges the risks 
identified by each LOB and Corporate, maintains the 
central repository and provides the consolidated 
Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee 
(“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. 
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by Risk 
Appetite frameworks for quantitative and qualitative 
risks. The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and 
approved by senior management (including the CEO 
and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. 
Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to 
monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk 
consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite 
results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides 
channels for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC and the Board of Directors, as 
appropriate. 
The chart below illustrates the principal standing committees of the Board of Directors and key senior 
management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other 
committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart 
below or described in this Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), 
General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior 
executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to 
the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating 
Committee and certain other members of senior 
management are responsible for escalating to the 
Board the information necessary to facilitate the 
Board’s exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the 
business and affairs of the Firm. This includes 
monitoring the Firm’s financial performance and 
condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and 
plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant 
portion of its oversight responsibilities through its 
principal standing committees, each of which consists 
solely of independent members of the Board. The 
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees 
the control environment, and the Compensation & 
Management Development Committee oversees 
compensation and other management-related 
matters. Each committee of the Board oversees 
reputation risks, conduct risks, and environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) matters within its scope 
of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the 
bank, which it discharges both acting directly and 
through the principal standing committees of the 
Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight 
on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the 
responsibility of the Board Risk Committee and the 
Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to 
compensation and other management-related 
matters, the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its 
oversight of management’s responsibility to 
implement a global risk management framework 
reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage 
the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s 
responsibilities include approval of applicable primary 
risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
93
management. Breaches in risk appetite and 
parameters, issues that may have a material adverse 
impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity 
issues, and other significant risk-related matters are 
escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as 
appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibilities to ensure that there 
is an effective system of controls reasonably designed 
to safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the 
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and 
maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, 
policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and 
regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of 
the qualifications, independence and performance of 
the Firm’s independent registered public accounting 
firm, and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal 
Audit function.
The Compensation & Management Development 
Committee (“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight 
of the Firm’s compensation principles and practices. 
The CMDC reviews and approves the Firm’s 
compensation and qualified benefits programs. The 
Committee reviews the performance of Operating 
Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the 
CEO’s compensation award is subject to ratification by 
the independent directors of the Board. The CMDC 
also reviews the development of and succession for 
key executives. As part of the Board’s role of 
reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s 
culture, including reviewing updates from 
management regarding significant conduct issues and 
any related actions with respect to employees, 
including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and 
reviews the Firm's positions and practices on public 
responsibility matters such as community investment, 
fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and 
other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values 
and character and could impact the Firm's reputation 
among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides 
guidance on these matters to management and the 
Board, as appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
exercises general oversight with respect to the 
governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the 
qualifications of and recommends to the Board 
proposed nominees for election to the Board. The 
Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board 
corporate governance practices applicable to the 
Firm. It also reviews the framework for assessing the 
Board’s performance and self-evaluation. 
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that 
are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions 
include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s 
highest management-level risk committee. It oversees 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a 
forum for discussion of risk-related and other topics 
and issues that are raised or escalated by its members 
and other committees.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an 
escalation committee for senior management to 
review and discuss the Firmwide compliance and 
operational risk environment, including identified 
issues, compliance and operational risk metrics and 
significant events that have been escalated. 
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for overseeing the governance, limits and 
controls that have been established within the scope 
of their respective activities. These committees review 
the ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses 
operating in a particular region could be exposed to 
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, 
accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of 
matters brought to these committees. 
Management’s discussion and analysis
94
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Line of Business and Corporate Function Control 
Committees oversee the risk and control environment 
of their respective business or function, inclusive of 
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As 
part of that mandate, they are responsible for 
reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and 
other data that may impact the level of compliance and 
operational risk in a business or function, addressing 
key compliance and operational risk issues, with an 
emphasis on processes with control concerns, and 
overseeing control remediation. 
The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is 
responsible for overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability 
management (“ALM”), including the activities and 
frameworks supporting management of the balance 
sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and capital risk. 
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks 
arising from valuation activities conducted across the 
Firm.
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm monitors and measures its risk through risk 
governance and oversight functions. The scope of a 
particular function or business activity may include 
one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For 
example, Country Risk Management oversees country 
risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of 
exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types 
such as credit or market risk. 
The following sections discuss the risk governance 
and oversight functions that have been established to 
oversee the risks inherent in the Firm’s business 
activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly-designed or failed 
business plans or an inadequate response to changes 
in the operating environment. 
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior 
leadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible 
for managing the Firm’s most significant strategic 
risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business 
discussions and decision-making, including 
participation in relevant business reviews and senior 
management meetings, risk and control committees 
and other relevant governance forums, and review of 
acquisitions and new business initiatives. The Board of 
Directors oversees management’s strategic decisions, 
and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the 
Firm’s risk governance framework.
In the process of developing business plans and 
strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior 
management identify the associated risks that are 
incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification 
framework and their impact on risk appetite. 
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of 
the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess 
their impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes 
the development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other 
strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the 
Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the 
Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and 
includes components such as budget, risk appetite, 
capital, earnings and asset-liability management 
objectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business Principles, 
the Operating Committee and senior management 
teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update 
the strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the 
strategic framework and performance of strategic  
initiatives, assessing the operating environment, 
refining existing strategies and developing new 
strategies.
The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s 
assessment, are provided to the Board as part of its 
review and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and 
the plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.  
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on 
risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust 
liquidity, is also a component in the management of 
strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on 
pages 97–107 for further information on capital risk. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 
for further information on liquidity risk. Refer to 
Reputation Risk Management on page 116 for further 
information on reputation risk.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient 
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s 
business activities and associated risks during normal 
economic environments and under stressed 
conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s 
business strategy and competitive position. 
Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through 
economic volatility is a strategic imperative of the 
Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating 
Committee. The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet” 
philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong 
capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk 
management strategy focuses on maintaining long-
term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in 
market-leading businesses, including in highly 
stressed environments. Senior management considers 
the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making 
significant decisions that could impact future business 
activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s 
earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all 
sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the 
Firm’s capital strength.
Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of capital risk across the Firm.
Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk 
metrics;
• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk 
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
• Developing processes to classify, monitor and report 
capital limit breaches; 
• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital 
management activities, including changes made to 
the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and
• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory 
capital framework intended to ensure compliance 
with applicable regulatory capital rules.
Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital 
management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital 
management are to:
• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to 
build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through 
normal economic cycles and in stressed 
environments;
• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future 
investment opportunities;
• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a 
source of strength to its subsidiaries;
• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum 
regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-
capitalized” status for the Firm and its principal 
insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all times under 
applicable regulatory capital requirements;
• Meet capital distribution objectives; and
• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 
throughout a resolution period in accordance with 
the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements 
and maintaining a strong capital governance 
framework. The internal minimum capital levels 
consider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements 
as well as an internal assessment of capital 
adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress 
events;
• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 
potential events; and
• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and 
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at 
the Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s 
capital management include the Capital Governance 
Committee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional 
ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) 
Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee 
periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. 
Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 91–95 
for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and 
other risk-related committees.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank 
Holding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually 
a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by 
the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 
and other stress testing processes to assess whether 
large BHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital 
during periods of economic and financial stress, and 
have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and 
planning processes in place that address each BHC’s 
unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain 
stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve 
evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal 
capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as 
well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
97
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse 
scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine 
each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement 
for the coming year. 
The Firm's current SCB requirement is 3.3% and will 
remain in effect until September 30, 2025. The Firm’s 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including 
regulatory buffers, was 12.3% as of December 31, 2024.
Refer to Capital actions on page 105 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors. 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs 
the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of 
the Firm’s processes for managing the sources and 
uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory 
expectations for capital planning and capital 
adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing 
protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit 
Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital planning framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of 
alternative economic and business scenarios on the 
Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and 
the parameters underlying those scenarios, are 
defined centrally and applied uniformly across the 
businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of 
business results; global market shocks, which 
generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios 
are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities 
and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to 
CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management 
also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity 
analyses, as necessary. 
Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the 
capital management framework for the Firm and 
specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach 
towards capital management in normal economic 
conditions and in stressed environments. The 
Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm 
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets 
minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and 
sets out the capital contingency actions that are 
expected to be taken or considered at various levels of 
capital depletion during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes 
similar minimum capital requirements and standards 
for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally 
follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as 
amended from time to time.
Basel III Overview 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum 
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards 
for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and 
banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according 
to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two 
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for 
calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III 
Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III 
Advanced”). 
For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital 
adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of 
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared 
to their respective regulatory capital ratio 
requirements.
The current Basel III rules establish capital 
requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and 
market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, 
operational risk RWA. Key differences in the 
calculation of credit risk RWA between the 
Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-
sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of 
internal credit models and parameters, whereas for 
Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally 
based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary 
primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market 
risk RWA is generally calculated consistently between 
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In 
addition to the RWA calculated under these 
approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts 
to incorporate management judgment and feedback 
from its regulators.
As of December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Basel III 
Standardized ratios risk-based ratios were more 
binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. 
Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, 
calculate their SLRs. 
Refer to page 104 for additional information on SLR.

Key Regulatory Developments 
U.S. Basel III Finalization
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the 
FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based 
capital framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: 
Amendments applicable to large banking 
organizations and to banking organizations with 
significant trading activity", which is referred to in this 
Form 10-K as the "U.S. Basel III proposal". Under this 
proposal, changes to the framework would include 
replacement of the Advanced approach with an 
expanded risk-based approach for the calculation of 
RWA. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement 
would be applicable to both the expanded risk-based 
approach and the Standardized approach.
GSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD 
Requirements
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a proposal 
to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Under 
the proposal, the annual GSIB surcharge would be 
based on an average of the quarterly surcharge 
calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily 
averaging required for certain measures. The proposal 
would also reduce surcharge increments from 50 bps 
to 10 bps and includes other technical amendments to 
the “Method 2” calculation. The proposed changes 
would revise risk-based capital requirements for the 
Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. Refer to Risk-based Capital 
Regulatory Requirements on page 100 for further 
information on the GSIB surcharge. 
Additionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the 
FDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the 
eligible long-term debt ("eligible LTD") and clean 
holding company requirements under the existing 
total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") rule to apply to 
non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total 
consolidated assets. The proposal would also reduce 
the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less 
than two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC 
requirement and expand the existing capital deduction 
framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD 
issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD 
requirements. 
Finalization of the above proposals, including the 
required implementation dates, is uncertain. The Firm 
continues to monitor developments and potential 
impacts.

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in 
effect.
All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.
Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as 
a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital 
conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a 
discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed 
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced 
regulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable 
SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized 
regulatory capital requirements. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is 
required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual 
basis under two separately prescribed methods based 
on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject 
to the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB 
surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s 
assessment methodology, and is calculated across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2” modifies the Method 1 requirements to 
include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in 
place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score 
“multiplication factor”. 
The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB 
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023. For 2025, the Firm’s effective regulatory 
minimum GSIB surcharge calculated under both 
Method 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.5% 
and 4.5%, respectively.
2024
2023
Method 1
 2.5 %
 2.5 %
Method 2
 4.5 %
 4.0 %
The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical 
capital buffer taking into account the macro financial 
environment in which large, internationally active 
banks function. As of December 31, 2024, the U.S. 
countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The 
Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at 
least annually. The buffer can be increased if the 
Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC determine that 
systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject 
to a 12-month implementation period. 
Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in 
excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum 
plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the 
GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will 
result in limitations to the amount of capital that the 
Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and 
common share repurchases, as well as on 
discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. 
GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to 
maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible 
LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 106 for additional 
information.
Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III 
Advanced approach are currently required to have a 
minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, 
including the Firm, are also required to hold an 
additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as 
Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total 
leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is 
calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-
balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be 
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-
balance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory 
capital rules. Refer to SLR on page 104 for additional 
information.
Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as 
well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain 
executive officers.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., must also maintain 
minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action 
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act, 
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional 
information. 
Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital 
ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital 
standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in 
Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital 
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website, for further information on the Firm’s current 
capital measures.

Line of business and Corporate equity 
Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking 
into consideration a variety of factors including capital 
levels of similarly rated peers and applicable 
regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and 
internal targets for expected returns are established 
as key measures of an LOB’s performance. 
The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology 
incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB 
surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well 
as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital 
are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to 
the LOBs and Corporate may change. As of January 1, 
2025, changes to the Firm’s capital allocations are 
primarily a result of updates to the Firm’s current 
capital requirements and changes in RWA for each 
LOB under rules currently in effect. Any capital that the 
Firm has accumulated in excess of these current 
requirements, including the capital required to meet 
the potential increased requirements of the U.S. Basel 
III proposal, has been retained in Corporate in addition 
to its allocated balance.

Through June 30, 2024, the Firm was authorized to 
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its 
previously-approved common share repurchase 
program that was announced on April 13, 2022.

(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended 
share repurchases, which it resumed in the first quarter of 2023 
under its common share repurchase program.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s 
discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase 
program approved by the Board of Directors does not 
establish specific price targets or timetables. 
Management determines the amount and timing of 
common share repurchases based on various factors, 
including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking 
into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and other investment opportunities. The 
amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases 
in any period may be substantially more or less than 
the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in 
prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the 
decision-making process. The Firm’s common share 
repurchases may be suspended by management at 
any time; and may be executed through open market 
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or 
utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading 
plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time 
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise 
not be repurchasing common shares — for example, 
during internal trading blackout periods.

Other capital requirements 
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. 
GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to 
maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible 
long-term debt.
The external TLAC requirements and the minimum 
level of eligible long-term debt requirements are 
shown below:
(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to 
their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.
Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result 
in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm 
may distribute, such as through dividends and 
common share repurchases, as well as on 
discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.
The following table presents the eligible external TLAC 
and eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation 
of these amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to 
meet its cash and collateral needs as they arise or that 
it does not have the appropriate amount, composition 
and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets 
and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk management
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) 
function whose primary objective is to provide 
independent oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. 
Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities include: 
• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk 
metrics; 
• Independently establishing and monitoring limits 
and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; 
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 
limit breaches; 
• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 
management processes to evaluate their adequacy 
and effectiveness; 
• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 
entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined 
metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet 
variances and funding activities; and 
• Approving or escalating for review new or updated 
liquidity stress assumptions.
Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity 
management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity 
management are to:  
• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material 
legal entities are able to operate in support of client 
needs and meet contractual and contingent financial 
obligations through normal economic cycles as well 
as during stress events, and 
• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 
liquidity sources. 
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity 
characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the 
Firm, LOBs, legal entities, as well as currencies, 
taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational 
restrictions; 
• Developing and maintaining internal liquidity stress 
testing assumptions; 
• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-
specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 
• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved limits 
and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite 
tolerances; 
• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 
related to funding and liquidity risk; and 
• Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities 
as well as certain off-balance sheet items. 
As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management 
strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using 
a centralized, global approach designed to:  
• Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 
• Monitor exposures; 
• Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity 
between the Firm’s legal entities; and 
• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity 
at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 
Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance 
include the Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional ALCOs, 
the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk 
Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee 
reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for 
approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity 
strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 91–95 for further discussion of 
ALCO and other risk-related committees. 
Internal stress testing
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to 
monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material 
legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, 
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s 
resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests 
are produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests 
are performed in response to specific market events or 
concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the 
Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and 
take into consideration: 
• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 
funding markets; 
• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash 
outflows;
• Credit rating downgrades; 
• Collateral haircuts; and 
• Potential impediments to the availability and 
transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or 
other restrictions. 
Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time 
horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate 
both market and idiosyncratic stresses. 
Results of stress tests are considered in the 
formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment 
of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a 
source of funding for the Firm through equity and 
Management’s discussion and analysis
108
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding 
company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), 
provides funding to support the ongoing operations of 
the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm 
manages liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and 
operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply 
with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity 
requirements, and to manage through periods of 
stress when access to normal funding sources may be 
disrupted.
Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out 
the strategies for addressing and managing liquidity 
resource needs during a liquidity stress event and 
incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk 
appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the 
alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources 
available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of 
stress. 
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA 
that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated 
total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-
day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for 
purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of 
unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational 
considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA 
primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid 
securities as defined in the LCR rule.
Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held 
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its 
stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that 
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be 
excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.
Estimated net cash outflows are based on 
standardized stress outflow and inflow rates 
prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the 
balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and 
obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. 
The following table summarizes the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the 
three months ended December 31, 2024, September 
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on the Firm’s

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR increased

compared with the three months ended September 
30, 2024, driven by activities in CIB Markets, partially 
offset by lower market values of HQLA-eligible 
investment securities and funding maturities.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the 
three months ended December 31, 2024 decreased 
compared with the three months ended December 31, 
2023, driven by dividend payments to the Parent 
Company and lending activity, largely offset by higher 
market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities, 
a reduction in unencumbered non-HQLA AFS 
securities, activities in CIB Markets, and long-term 
debt issuances.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
109
Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s 
average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due 
to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and 
estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing 
business activity and from the impacts of Federal 
Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to the 
Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the 
Firm’s LCR.
Liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt 
securities, that the Firm believes would be available to 
raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA 
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of 
these securities was approximately $594 billion and 
$649 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, although the amount of liquidity that 
could be raised at any particular time would be 
dependent on prevailing market conditions. The 
decrease compared to December 31, 2023, was driven 
by reductions in unencumbered AFS securities in 
Treasury and CIO, excess eligible HQLA securities at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB 
trading assets.
The Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available 
cash and securities as of both December 31, 2024 and 
2023. For each respective period, the amount was 
comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding 
the impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately 
$834 billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered 
marketable securities with a fair value of 
approximately $594 billion and $649 billion.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of 
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $413 billion and $340 billion as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This 
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and 
securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other 
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at 
the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other 
central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased 
from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher 
amount of commercial loans and credit card 
receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. 
Although available, the Firm does not view this 
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks 
discount window and the other central banks as a 
primary source of liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” 
stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” 
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.  
For the three months ended December 31, 2024, both 
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were 
compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, 
based on the Firm’s interpretation of the final NSFR 
rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report on 
the Firm’s website for additional information.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- 
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both 
short- and long-term cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through 
diverse sources of funding including deposits, secured 
and unsecured funding in the capital markets and 
stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding 
source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding 
through short- or long-term secured borrowings, the 
issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from 
borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank 
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term 
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured 
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-
term liquid investments based on their interest rate 
and liquidity risk characteristics. 
Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–
balance sheet obligations.

(a) In the fourth quarter of 2023, CCB transferred certain deposits associated with First Republic to AWM and CIB. 
The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable 
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on 
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of 
the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and 
wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are generally considered to be 
stable sources of liquidity because they are generated 
from customers that maintain operating service 
relationships with the Firm. 
The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods 
of market disruption, average deposit trends may be 
impacted.
The following discussion excludes the impact of the 
transfer of certain First Republic deposits in the fourth 
quarter of 2023 from CCB to the other LOBs as the 
transfers had no net impact on Firmwide deposits.
Average deposits increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended 
December 31, 2023, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly 
in Payments and net issuances of structured notes 
as a result of client demand in Markets, partially 
offset by deposit attrition, which included actions 
taken to reduce certain deposits,
• the timing impact of First Republic,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances 
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely 
offset by continued migration into other 
investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending, largely offset by new accounts. 
Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 
2023, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly 
in Payments, largely offset by net maturities of 
structured notes in Markets,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances 
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely 
offset by continued migration into other 
investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending and migration into higher-
yielding investments, predominantly offset by new 
accounts.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection 
that provides additional funding stability and results in 
a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may 
be available to depositors in the countries in which the 
deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides 
deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a 
U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2024 and 
2023
(a), the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits 
were $1,414.0 billion and $1,347.8 billion, respectively, 
primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.
Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The 
table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and 
non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. 
The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time 
deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates 
periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For 
purposes of this presentation, all non-U.S. time 
deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured 
funding is securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured 
predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, 
including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS. Securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by 
Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-
making activities and higher secured financing of 
trading assets.
The increase in secured other borrowed funds at 
December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, as well 
as the increase for the average year ended 
December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, 
were both due to higher financing requirements in 
Markets, partially offset by FHLB maturities in 
Treasury and CIO.
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time 
due to investment and financing activities of clients, 
the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing 
management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, 
including its secured and unsecured financing (for 
both the investment securities and market-making 
portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.
The Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured 
funding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds. 
The decrease in average commercial paper for the 
year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior 
year period was due to lower issuances primarily as a 
result of short-term liquidity management.
The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at 
December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, was 
predominantly driven by net issuances of structured 
notes in Markets.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
113
Long-term funding
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, 
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal 
long-term funding plan. 
Unsecured funding and issuance
The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to 
provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company 
advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external 
counterparties. The increase in structured notes at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, and for the 
average year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets due to client demand.
The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have 
an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity 
sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional 
collateral or funding requirements and decrease the 
number of investors and counterparties willing to lend 
to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of 
ratings downgrades depends on numerous 
contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm 
believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress 
testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains 
sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in 
funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs 
and other third-party commitments may be adversely 
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Notes 5 
and 14 for additional information.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and certain of its principal subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 were as

(iii) revised its outlook for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. from negative to developing, reflecting its view with respect to possible support from 
the U.S. government; and (iv) assessed its outlook for J.P. Morgan SE as negative with an “(m)” modifier, reflecting a negative outlook for long-

(b) The credit ratings of the Parent Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the other subsidiaries presented in the table reflect ratings 
upgrades by Standard & Poor’s on November 15, 2024. Standard & Poor’s also revised its outlook for the Parent Company and such 
subsidiaries from positive to stable. 
JPMorganChase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future 
borrowings or require additional collateral, based on 
unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, 
financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings 
include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong 
capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and 
risk management controls, and diverse funding 
sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate 
economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory 
developments, future profitability, risk management 
practices, and litigation matters, as well as their 
broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction 
may negatively impact perception of the Firm’s 
integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s 
competence by various stakeholders, including clients, 
counterparties, customers, communities, investors, 
regulators, or employees. 
The types of events that may result in reputation risk 
are wide-ranging and can be introduced by the Firm’s 
employees, business strategies and activities, clients, 
customers and counterparties with which the Firm 
does business. These events could contribute to 
financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement 
actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as 
other harm to the Firm. 
Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the 
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is 
inherently challenging to identify, manage, and 
quantify.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function 
includes the following activities:
• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and a standard consistent with the reputation 
risk framework 
• Providing oversight of the governance framework 
through processes and infrastructure to support 
consistent identification, escalation and monitoring 
of reputation risk issues Firmwide
Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes 
the principles for managing reputation risk for the 
Firm. It is the responsibility of each LOB and 
Corporate, and the Firm’s employees, to consider the 
reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer 
a new product, engage in a transaction or client 
relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a 
business process or consider any other activity. 
Environmental impacts and social concerns are 
important considerations in assessing the Firm’s 
reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s 
reputation risk governance.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with 
the default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, 
including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, 
and investment portfolio risk.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or 
change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or 
customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of 
clients and customers, ranging from large corporate 
and institutional clients to individual consumers and 
small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm 
is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home 
lending, credit card, auto, and business banking 
businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, 
lending, market-making, and hedging activities with 
and for clients and counterparties, as well as through 
its operating services activities (such as cash 
management and clearing activities), and securities 
financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit 
risk through its investment securities portfolio and 
cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors and measures 
credit risk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk 
policies, procedures and limits. The Firm’s credit risk 
management governance includes the following 
activities:
• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
• Monitoring and measuring credit risk across all 
portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval
• Setting industry and geographic concentration 
limits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for 
credit review and analysis
• Assigning and maintaining credit approval 
authorities in connection with the approval of credit 
exposure
• Monitoring and independent assessment of 
criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 
credit risk-based capital management
Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor 
or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring 
credit risk vary depending on several factors, including 
type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk 
measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status 
and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-
rating) and risk management and collection processes 
(e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed 
workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on 
the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, 
the loss severity given a default event and the 
exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and 
estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm 
estimates credit losses for its exposures. The 
allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit 
losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-
investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-
related commitments reflects estimated credit losses 
related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and 
the allowance for investment securities reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the investment 
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and 
Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on 
pages 161–164 for further information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses 
relative to the established allowances for loan losses 
and lending-related commitments. The analyses for 
these losses include stress testing that considers 
alternative economic scenarios as described below.
Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress 
testing process assesses the potential impact of 
alternative economic and business scenarios on 
estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic 
scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined 
centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic 
factors and applied across the businesses. The stress 
test results may indicate credit migration, changes in 
delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit 
portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional 
stresses outside these scenarios, including industry 
and country- specific stress scenarios, as appropriate. 
The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on 
setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as 
well as to assess the impact of stress on individual 
counterparties.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity 
of the approval and decision-making process for 
extending credit so that credit risks are assessed 
accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly 
and managed actively at both the transaction and 
portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes 
credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-
rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used 
in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are 
independently validated by groups that are separate 
from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the 
portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be 
addressed through changes in underwriting policies 
and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management 
evaluates delinquency and other trends against 
business expectations, current and forecasted 
economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and 
trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated 
consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring 
of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. 
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an 
aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and 
counterparty level with established concentration 
limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as 
deemed appropriate by management. Industry and 
counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure 
and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-
based loss constraints.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk 
exposure is accomplished through a number of means, 
including:
• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes
• Loan syndications and participations
• Loan sales and securitizations
• Credit derivatives
• Master netting agreements, and
• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques
In addition to Credit Risk Management, an 
independent Credit Review function is responsible for: 
• Independently assessing risk grades assigned to 
exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio 
and the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by 
responsible business units; and 
• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit 
management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, 
including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk 
grading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper 
monitoring and management of credit exposures, 
and compliance with applicable grading policies and 
underwriting guidelines. 
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer 
and wholesale loans.
Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective 
decision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit 
quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile 
changes are reported regularly to senior members of 
Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting 
of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, 
product and geography are prepared, and the 
appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is 
reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly 
basis. Through the risk reporting and governance 
structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are 
provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk 
committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2023 driven by 
residential real estate loans and scored auto loans.
The following discussions provide information 
concerning individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 
for further information about this portfolio, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications 
and other credit quality indicators.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage 
loans and home equity lines of credit. 
Retained loans decreased compared to December 31, 
2023, predominantly driven by paydowns and loan 
sales, net of originations. Retained nonaccrual loans 
decreased compared to December 31, 2023, 
predominantly driven by loan sales. Net recoveries 
were higher for the year ended December 31, 2024 
compared to the prior year, driven by loan sales. 
Loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual loans held-for-sale 
increased from December 31, 2023, predominantly 
driven by transfers of certain retained loans in 
anticipation of securitization and loan sales, 
respectively. 
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2023, 
predominantly driven by higher Home Lending loans, 
as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales. 
Nonaccrual loans at fair value increased compared to 
December 31, 2023, driven by CIB.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of 
retained interest-only residential mortgage loans were 
$88.9 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These 
loans have an interest-only payment period generally 
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully 
amortizing payment period to maturity and are 
typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-
income borrowers. The credit performance of this 
portfolio is comparable to the performance of the 
broader prime mortgage portfolio.
The carrying value of retained home equity lines of 
credit outstanding was $14.5 billion at December 31, 
2024, including $3.8 billion of HELOCs that have 
recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments 
or have been modified, and $3.6 billion of interest-only 
balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. 
The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their 
revolving period by reducing or canceling the undrawn 
line in accordance with the contract or to the extent 
otherwise permitted by law, including when there has 
been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness 
of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of 
the underlying property.
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or 
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, 
predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain 
potential unrecoverable claim payments related to 
government-insured loans and considers this 
exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, generally consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, 
other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The 
portfolio decreased when compared to December 31, 
2023, predominantly due to loan securitizations. Net 
charge-offs increased compared to the prior year, 
predominantly due to net charge-offs of scored auto 
loans of $445 million compared to $357 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in 
used vehicle valuations. Refer to Note 14 for further

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 
2023 reflecting growth from new accounts and 
revolving balances. The December 31, 2024 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and 1.14%, 
respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 
2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.14% and 
1.05%, respectively, in line with the Firm’s 
expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the year 
ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year 
reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in 
recent years, credit normalization and balance growth.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes 
the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to 
credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for 
clients and counterparties, as well as through various 
operating services (such as cash management and 
clearing activities), securities financing activities and 
cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans 
originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale 
businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. 
The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio 
is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-
depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction 
structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and 
of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to 
the industry discussion on pages 128–131 for further 
information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes 
exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-
rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale 
methodology is applied when determining the 
allowance for loan losses.
As of December 31, 2024, loans increased $19.8 billion, 
driven by higher loans in CIB and higher securities-
based lending in AWM. Lending-related commitments 
decreased $5.3 billion, with decreases in AWM and 
CCB, largely offset by higher commitments in CIB.
As of December 31, 2024, nonperforming exposure 
increased by $2.3 billion, predominantly driven by Real 
Estate, concentrated in Office, Healthcare and 
Consumer & Retail, in each case resulting from 
downgrades.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, wholesale net 
charge-offs were $822 million, largely driven by Real 
Estate, concentrated in Office, and client-specific 
charge-offs across multiple industries including 
Consumer & Retail and Individuals.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the 
reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has 
purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm 
obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 
(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual 
maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2024, may become payable prior to maturity based on their 
cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 
Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, 
which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding 
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion and $41.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
representing approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $44.7 billion, 
$39.9 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Real Estate resulting from 
downgrades, primarily in Multifamily and Office, and new commitments in Technology and Media, partially offset by 
Consumer & Retail resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The industry of 
risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on industry concentrations.

Presented below is additional detail on certain of the Firm’s industry exposures.
Real Estate
Real Estate exposure was $207.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. Criticized exposure increased by $3.2 billion from 
$9.2 billion at December 31, 2023 to $12.4 billion at December 31, 2024, predominantly driven by downgrades, 
primarily in Multifamily and Office.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, 
such as commitments (including revolving credit 
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing 
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these 
financial instruments represent the maximum possible 
credit risk should the clients draw down on these 
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations 
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. 
Most of these commitments and guarantees have 
historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or 
expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-
related commitments is representative of the Firm’s 
expected future credit exposure or funding 
requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information 
on wholesale lending-related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM 
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the 
clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, 
and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or 
equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm 
establishes margin requirements and monitors the 
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires 
clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or 
to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising 
from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance 
requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as 
the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of 
collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the 
borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when 
the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these 
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not 
require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in 
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses 
is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses 
based on the value of the collateral and probability of 
borrower default. These receivables are reported within 
accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s 
accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk, including credit risk and risks arising from 
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and 
equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes 
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and 
uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with 
net open risk positions from its market-making 
activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising 
from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the 
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is 
exposed. For over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, the 
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-
counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also 
be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where 
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk 
exposures arising from derivative contracts through the 
use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements 
and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s 
OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral 
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, 
which are not typically covered by collateral agreements 
due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades 
that are settled daily — was approximately 86% and 87% 
at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to 
Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of 
collateral agreements and for a further discussion of 
derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement 
types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets was $61.0 billion and $54.9 
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 
increase was primarily as a result of market movements. 
Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the 
derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and the related 
cash collateral held by the Firm.
In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other 
cash collateral that may be used as security when the 
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. 
For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is 
consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets 
as defined in the LCR rule.
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of 
current credit risk should also take into consideration 
other collateral, which generally represents securities 
that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the 
LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the 
net amount of the derivative receivables for each 
counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, 
G7 government securities, other liquid government 
agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt 
and equity securities) delivered by clients at the 
initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to 
contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and 
collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not 
yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this 
collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and 
is not included in the tables below, it is available as 
security against potential exposure that could arise 
should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements 
for derivative transactions.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the 
net fair value of the derivative receivables does not 
capture the potential future variability of that credit 
exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm 
calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures 
of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, 
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average 
exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate 
netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, 
to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is 
broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the 
life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure 
used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative 
contracts, senior management reporting and 
derivatives exposure management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, 
on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of 
the Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit 
of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total 
life of the derivative contract is used as the primary 
metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate 
credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below. 
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in 
the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that 
active risk management is essential to controlling the 
dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In 
addition, the Firm’s risk management process for 
derivatives exposures takes into consideration the 
potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly 
defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is 
positively correlated with the impact of a default by the 
same counterparty, which could cause exposure to 
increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many 
factors may influence the nature and magnitude of 
these correlations over time. To the extent that these 
correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the 
CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. 
The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by 
entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as 
interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity 
derivative contracts.
The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The 
three measures generally show that exposure will 
decline after the first year, if no new trades are added 
to the portfolio.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary 
purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and 
second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own 
credit risk associated with various exposures.
Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-
related commitments) and derivatives counterparty 
exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses 
(collectively, “credit portfolio management activities”). 
Information on credit portfolio management activities 
is provided in the table below. 
The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising 
from certain securities held in the Firm’s market-
making businesses. These credit derivatives are not 
included in credit portfolio management activities.

(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net 
protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying 
reference entity or index. 
The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio 
management activities do not qualify for hedge 
accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are 
reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized 
in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans 
and lending-related commitments being risk-
managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This 
asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans 
and lending-related commitments and the credit 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes 
in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a 
hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary 
depending on a number of factors, including the 
named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience 
losses on specific exposures that are different than the 
named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the 
contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a 
defined credit event that does not align with an actual 
loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be 
shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm 
generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a 
maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity 
date of the exposure for which the protection was 
purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are 
actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to 
Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on 
credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit 
portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over 
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The 
Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the 
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated) and is presented separately on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, 
which is reflected in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities, which is reflected in investment securities 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 
2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 
billion from December 31, 2023.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
included:
• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting:
– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, 
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting 
higher revolving balances, including the seasoning 
of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and 
• a net reduction of $30 million in wholesale, 
reflecting:
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by 
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to 
include additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and 
downside risks related to the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic environment.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated 
using a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors 
than the central case assumptions provided in the 
table below, resulting in:
• a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking 
at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and
• a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% 
lower than the central case at the end of the second 
quarter of 2026.
The following table presents the Firm’s central case 
assumptions for the periods presented:

estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit 
losses in future periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the 
loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities 
portfolio or from principal investments. The 
investment securities portfolio is predominantly held 
by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's 
balance sheet and asset-liability management 
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly 
privately-held financial instruments and are managed 
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically 
intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure 
associated with a default in the payment of principal 
and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the 
investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and 
CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. 
At December 31, 2024, the Treasury and CIO 
investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for 
credit losses, was $678.3 billion, and the average 
credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio 
was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, 
and where not available, based primarily upon internal 
risk ratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 88–
90 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk 
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
108–115 for further information on related liquidity risk. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149 
for further information on the market risk inherent in 
the portfolio.
Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s 
Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC 
Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the 
Board Risk Committee. 
The Firm’s independent control functions are 
responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the 
carrying value of investment securities in accordance 
with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment 
securities are established for each risk category, 
including capital and credit risks.
Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically privately-held 
financial instruments representing ownership interests 
or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal 
investments include tax-oriented investments and 
investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s 
business strategies and exclude those that are 
consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These 
investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the 
LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their 
respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will 
continue to evolve based on market circumstances 
and in line with its strategic initiatives.
The table below presents the aggregate carrying

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal investment 
risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance 
structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk 
policy framework for all principal investing activities 
that includes approval by executives who are 
independent from the investing businesses, as 
appropriate.
The Firm’s independent control functions are 
responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the 
carrying value of investments in accordance with 
relevant policies. As part of the risk governance 
structure, approved levels for investments are 
established and monitored for each relevant business 
or segment in order to manage the overall size of the 
portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on 
these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate 
losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.
Management’s discussion and analysis
140
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets 
and liabilities held for both the short and long term.  
Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks 
throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies 
and procedures. 
Market Risk Management seeks to facilitate efficient 
risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board 
of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management 
is responsible for the following functions:
• Maintaining a market risk policy framework
• Independently measuring and monitoring LOB, 
Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
• Defining, approving and monitoring limits
• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 
assessments
Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various 
metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess 
risk including:
• Value-at-risk 
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns 
• Earnings-at-risk
• Economic Value Sensitivity
• Other sensitivity-based measures
Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a 
series of limits set in the context of the market 
environment and business strategy. In setting limits, 
Market Risk Management takes into consideration 
factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, 
accommodation of client business, and management 
judgment. Market Risk Management maintains 
different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR 
and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits 
include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures 
such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be 
set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the 
legal entity level.
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly 
reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior 
management is responsible for reviewing and 
approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing 
basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within 
specified time periods by Market Risk Management 
are reported to senior management. The LOBs and 
Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and 
reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of 
a breach, Market Risk Management consults with 
senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm 
to determine the suitable course of action required to 
return the applicable positions to compliance, which 
may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the 
breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to 
accommodate an expected increase in client activity 
and/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level 
limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure 
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may 
be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 160.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the 
Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify 
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent 
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly 
over time.

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions 
which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. 
In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing 
activities. To the extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk 
measures and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 140 for additional 
discussion on principal investments.

Value-at-risk
JPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a 
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss 
from adverse market moves in the current market 
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework 
used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR 
and Regulatory VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using 
historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 
months. The framework’s approach assumes that 
historical changes in market values are representative 
of the distribution of potential outcomes in the 
immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk 
Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that 
is closely aligned to risk management decisions made 
by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other 
market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated 
assuming a one-day holding period and an expected 
tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% 
confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a 
consistent framework to measure risk profiles and 
levels of diversification across product types and is 
used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits 
across businesses. VaR results are reported as 
appropriate to various groups including senior 
management, the Board Risk Committee and 
regulators.  
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are 
individual VaR models that simulate historical market 
returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. 
To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s 
risk management framework, comprehensive VaR 
model calculations are performed daily for businesses 
whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR 
models are granular and incorporate numerous risk 
factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market 
values over the historical period; inputs are selected 
based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as 
sensitivities and historical time series used to generate 
daily market values may be different across product 
types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, 
particularly those associated with market illiquidity 
and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. 
For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and 
availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm 
uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other 
products when daily time series are not available. It is 
likely that using an actual price-based time series for 
these products, if available, would affect the VaR 
results presented. The Firm therefore considers other 
nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in 
addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk 
positions. 
As VaR model calculations require daily data and a 
consistent source for valuation, the daily market data 
used may be different than the independent third-
party data collected for VCG price testing in its 
monthly valuation process. For example, in cases 
where market prices are not observable, or where 
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data 
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 
2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation 
process. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in 
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s 
modeling techniques and measurements, and other 
factors. Such changes may affect historical 
comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and 
Model Risk Management on page 160 for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR 
in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory 
VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory 
VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital 
rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently 
assumes a ten business-day holding period and an 
expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 
99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to 
“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, 
which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR 
excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in 
contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, 
Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification 
benefit for certain VaR models.
Refer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on 
Regulatory VaR and the other components of market 
risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based 
measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the 
respective backtesting).

(a) The impact of the business segment reorganization in the second quarter of 2024 was not material to Total CIB VaR. Prior periods have not 
been revised. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on pages 70–90 for additional information.
(b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-
additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification 
benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the 
components.
(c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related 
commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not 
reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties 
was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related 
hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.
(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to disaggregate AWM VaR due to the increase 
associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments. The VaR does not include the 
retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.
(e) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa C shares which the Firm disposed of in the second and third 
quarters of 2024. The impact of Visa C shares resulted in elevated average and maximum Corporate VaR, Other VaR and Total VaR. Refer to 
Executive Overview on pages 54–58 for additional information.
2024 compared with 2023
Average Total VaR increased by $4 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2024 when compared with the 
prior year. The increase was predominantly driven by 
the impact of the Firm’s receipt of Visa C shares on 
Corporate VaR and increases associated with credit 
protection purchased against certain retained loans 
and lending-related commitments within Credit 
Portfolio VaR and AWM VaR, largely offset by market 
volatility rolling out of the one-year historical look-
back period impacting the Fixed income risk type.
The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The increase in VaR and 
subsequent decline observed in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by changes in Visa C share 
exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with 
the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR 
backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted 
in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported 
revenue as they exclude certain components of total 
net revenue, such as those associated with the 
execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-
driven trading and intraday risk management 
activities), fees, commissions, other valuation 
adjustments and net interest income. These excluded 
components of total net revenue may more than offset 
the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The 
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is 
consistent with the requirements for backtesting 
under Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily 
backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management 
VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk 
Management VaR methodology, assuming current 
changes in market values are consistent with the 
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five 
times every 100 trading days on average. The number 
of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ 
from the statistically expected number of backtesting 
exceptions if the current level of market volatility is 
materially different from the level of market volatility 
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR 
calculation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Firm 
posted backtesting gains on 179 of the 260 days, and 
observed eight VaR backtesting exceptions, of which 
three were in the three months ended December 31, 
2024. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from 
the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB 
Markets revenue, as the population of positions which 
comprise each metric are different and due to the 
exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in 
backtesting gains and losses as described above. 
The following chart presents the distribution of 
Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the 
trailing 12 months and three months ended 
December 31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are 
displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily 
Risk Management VaR. The count of days with 
backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty 
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are 
displayed within the intervals that are greater than one 
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ 
from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market 
Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on 
Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered 
positions.

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool 
used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss 
due to adverse changes in markets using recent 
historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the 
risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of 
market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. 
Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to 
losses under a range of stressed but possible 
economic and market scenarios. The results are used 
to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 
The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk 
sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The 
framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of 
potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-
offs, assuming significant changes in market factors 
such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, 
currency rates and commodity prices, and combines 
them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.  
The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus 
on tail events in specific asset classes and 
geographies, including how the event may impact 
multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also 
incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress 
basis risk between different products. The flexibility in 
the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new 
scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible 
future stress events. Stress testing results are 
reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate. 
Stress methodologies are governed by the overall 
stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves 
changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios 
across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework 
are escalated to senior management, as appropriate. 
In addition, stress methodology and the models to 
calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s 
Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy  
The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test 
results, which are reported periodically to the Board of 
Directors. In addition, stress testing results are 
incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, 
and are reported periodically to the Board Risk 
Committee. 
Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight 
trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A 
profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from 
its year-to-date peak level.
Structural interest rate risk management 
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s 
reported net income is important as interest rate risk 
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. 
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities 
which are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s 
traditional banking activities, which include extension 
of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing 
debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and 
associated derivative instruments. Refer to the table 
on page 142 for a summary by LOB and Corporate 
identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
Governance
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s 
interest rate risk management policy and related 
limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk 
Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership 
with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest 
rate risk profile and reviews it with senior 
management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting 
to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for 
providing independent oversight and governance 
around assumptions and establishing and monitoring 
limits for structural interest rate risk, including limits 
related to Earnings-at-Risk and Economic Value 
Sensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate 
risk generally through its investment securities 
portfolio and interest rate derivatives.
Key risk drivers and risk management process
Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of 
factors, including:
• Differences in timing among the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments
• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and 
off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or 
repricing at the same time
• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and 
long-term market interest rates change (for 
example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)
• The impact of changes in the maturity of various 
assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as 
interest rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide 
basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to 
Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, 
which takes into account the elements of interest rate 
exposure that can be risk-managed in financial 
markets. These elements include asset and liability 
balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual 
principal payment schedules, expected prepayment 
Management’s discussion and analysis

experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, 
rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate 
ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.
Earnings-at-Risk
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest 
rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk 
estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given 
interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to 
a baseline, which includes net interest income and 
certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses 
market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, 
pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of 
changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive 
assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and 
other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These 
simulations primarily include retained and held-for-
sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing 
activities, investment securities, long-term debt,  
related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing 
of other positions in risk management VaR and other 
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 142. 
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these 
simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar 
foreign exchange exposures arising from capital 
investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange 
risk on page 149 for more information.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential 
change to a baseline over the following 12 months 
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-
term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a 
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates 
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter 
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and 
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-
term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. 
These scenarios consider many different factors, 
including: 
• The impact on exposures as a result of 
instantaneous changes in interest rates from 
baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but 
excluding assumptions about actions that could be 
taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in 
response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage 
prepayment assumptions are based on the interest 
rates used in the scenarios compared with 
underlying contractual rates, the time since 
origination, and other factors which are updated 
periodically based on historical experience. Deposit 
forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s 
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain 
assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening 
and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that 
require management judgment. The amount of 
deposits that the Firm holds at any given time may 
be influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as 
broader monetary conditions and competition for 
deposits.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates 
paid could change upon a given change in market 
interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ 
from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to 
customer behavior and competition for deposits.
The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the 
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, 
including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts 
of deposit balances, both of which are especially 
significant in the case of consumer deposits. The 
results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the 
CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in 
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s 
simulation and other factors. In the second quarter of 
2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid 
assumptions which take into account observed pricing 
and client and customer behavior during the most 
recent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates 
paid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, 
resulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in higher 
interest rate scenarios, and an increase in negative 
sensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios. 
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures 
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s actual 
net interest income for the rate changes presented 
may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are 
modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any 
actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients or 
customers in response to rate changes. Other 
significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk 
scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and 
deposit rates paid, may also differ from actual results. 
The Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included 
in the Firm’s outlook on page 57.

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar 
rates, and the inclusion of the hedges of non-U.S. dollar capital 
investments. This inclusion had no impact on total sensitivities 
but increased U.S. dollar and decreased non-U.S. dollar 
sensitivities. Subsequent to this change, non-U.S. dollar 
sensitivities were insignificant.
(b) At December 31, 2023, represents the total of the Firm’s U.S. 
dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities as previously reported.
The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of December 
31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, were 
primarily driven by Treasury and CIO balance sheet 
actions where the Firm added duration through 
investment securities activity, cash flow hedges of 
retained loans and fair value hedges of Firm debt. The 
impact on the sensitivities of the Treasury and CIO 
balance sheet actions were largely offset by the impact 
of deposits, primarily from the second quarter of 2024 
update of the deposit rates paid assumptions for 
certain consumer and wholesale deposit products. 
Additionally, the results as of December 31, 2024 
reflected the update to include hedges of the Firm’s 
non-U.S. dollar capital investments. Although total 
results were not impacted, these hedges increase U.S. 
dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar 
sensitivities. In the absence of these updates the 
Firm’s sensitivities as of December 31, 2024, would

Economic Value Sensitivity
In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a 
sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 
months, the Firm also measures Economic Value 
Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term 
economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity 
of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily retained 
loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well 
as related hedges, under various interest rate 
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow 
assumptions associated with deposits, as well as 
prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are 
significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance 
with the CTC  interest rate risk management policy, the 
Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of 
TCE.
Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may 
differ from those required in the fair value 
measurement note to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. For example, certain assets and liabilities 
with no stated maturity, such as credit card 
receivables and deposits, have longer assumed 
durations in the EVS measure. Additional information 
on long-term debt and held to maturity investment 
securities is disclosed on page 201 in Note 2.

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or 
liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, 
forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt 
issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the 
Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by 
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to 
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on 
page 142 for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging 
purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be 
representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2024 and 2023, as the 
movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s 
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be 
exposed to country risk resulting from financial, 
economic, political or other significant developments 
which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s 
exposures related to a particular country or set of 
countries. The Country Risk Management group 
actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the 
extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified 
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to 
a country.
Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 
The Firm’s country risk management function includes 
the following activities:
• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 
consistent with a comprehensive country risk 
framework
• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks 
and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country
• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure 
and stress across the Firm
• Managing and approving country limits and 
reporting trends and limit breaches to senior 
management
• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling 
models and ratings indicators, for early identification 
of potential country risk concerns
• Providing country risk scenario analysis
Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending 
and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, 
whether cross-border or locally funded. Country 
exposure includes activity with both government and 
private-sector entities in a country. 
Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual 
country is based on the country where the largest 
proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest 
proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be 
different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or 
country of incorporation. 
Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of 
the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero 
recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or 
guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which 
result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country 
are not included in the country exposure measure (for 
example, providing clearing services or secondary 
exposure to collateral on securities financing 
receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in determining 
the measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, 
issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for 
attribution to an individual country. The use of 
different measurement approaches or assumptions 
could affect the amount of reported country exposure.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash 
balances placed with central banks, commercial 
banks, and other financial institutions
• Lending exposures are measured at the total 
committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of 
the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and 
marketable securities collateral received
• Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair 
value of all positions, including both long and short 
positions
• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net 
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for 
the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the 
fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, 
reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages 
these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from 
the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank 
regulatory requirements.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis 
by measuring the impact of adverse asset price 
movements to a country based on market shocks 
combined with counterparty specific assumptions. 
Country Risk Management periodically designs and 
runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to 
individual countries or  sets of countries in response to 
specific or potential market events, sector 
performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are 
used to  inform potential risk reduction across the 
Firm, as necessary.
Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and 
reported regularly, and used by Country Risk 
Management to identify trends and monitor high 
usages and breaches against limits.  
For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including dependent territories and 
Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) such as Hong 
Kong SAR, separately from the independent sovereign 
states with which they are associated.
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of 
December 31, 2024, and their comparative exposures 
as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country 
exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures 
by individual country. Country exposures may 
fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of 
factors, including client activity, market flows and 
liquidity management activities undertaken by the 
Firm. 
The increase in exposure to Germany when compared 
to December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in 
cash placed with the central bank of Germany, 
predominantly due to client-driven market-making 
activities and higher client deposits.
The increase in exposure to Japan when compared to 
December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash 
placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of 
client-driven market-making activities.
The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, 
which corresponds to cash placed with the central 
bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of 
clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The 
Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to 
Russia is not material. Refer to Note 30 on pages 310–
311 for information concerning Russian litigation.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
Climate risk refers to the potential threats posed by  
climate change to the Firm and its clients, customers, 
operations and business strategy. Climate change is 
viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing 
types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is 
categorized into physical risk and transition risk.
Physical risk involves economic costs and financial 
losses due to a changing climate. Acute physical risk 
drivers include the increased frequency or severity of 
climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires 
and tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers 
include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea 
level rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels 
and increases in average ambient temperatures.
Transition risk involves the financial and economic 
consequences of society’s shift toward a lower-carbon 
economy. Transition risk drivers include possible 
changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies 
and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks 
may also be influenced by changes in the physical 
climate.
Organization and management
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that 
is responsible for establishing and maintaining the 
Firmwide framework and strategy for managing 
climate risks that may impact the Firm.
Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management 
include:
• Setting policies, standards, procedures and 
processes to support identification, escalation, 
monitoring and management of climate risk across 
the Firm
• Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing 
mechanisms designed to assess the range of 
potential climate-related financial and economic 
impacts to the Firm
• Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy 
and the supporting climate risk technology 
infrastructure
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification, assessment and management of climate 
risks present in their business activities and for the 
adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules 
and regulations.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s framework and strategy for managing 
climate risk is integrated into the Firm’s risk 
governance structure. This framework allows for the 
escalation of significant climate risk-related issues to 
LOB Risk Committees. The Board Risk Committee also 
receives information on significant climate risks and 
climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes 
or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. 
Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, 
and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is 
inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself 
in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business 
disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary 
events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, 
inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial 
position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the 
markets and regulatory environments in which it 
operates. 
Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to 
enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational 
risk. 
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control 
Management Organization, which consists of control 
managers within each LOB and Corporate, is 
responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR 
Framework. 
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) 
and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR 
Management Framework and establishing the 
minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and 
Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the 
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the 
respective businesses or functions they oversee. The 
CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk 
Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.
Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-
assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and 
Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their 
respective control environment to assess 
circumstances in which controls have failed, and to 
determine where remediation efforts may be required. 
The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance 
organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) 
provides oversight of and challenge to these 
evaluations and may also perform independent 
assessments of significant operational risk events and 
areas of concentrated or emerging risk.
Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an 
independent assessment of the operational risks 
inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which 
includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control 
environments and reporting the results to senior 
management.
In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, 
including operational risk-based capital and 
estimation of operational risk losses under both 
baseline and stressed conditions. 
The primary component of the operational risk-based 
capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach 
(“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the 
projected frequency and severity of operational risk 
losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used 
to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a 
one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. 
The LDA model incorporates actual internal 
operational risk losses in the quarter following the 
period in which those losses were realized, and the 
calculation generally continues to reflect such losses 
even after the issues or business activities giving rise 
to the losses have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk capital methodology, which 
uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), 
incorporates internal and external losses as well as 
management’s view of tail risk captured through 
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of 
key business environment and internal control metrics. 
The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its 
AMA estimate of operational risk capital. 
The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk 
events that may occur in a stressed environment. The 
Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is 
utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and 
other stress testing processes. 
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and 
CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and Testing
The results of risk assessments performed by 
Operational Risk and Compliance are used in 
connection with their independent monitoring and 
testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
153
laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and 
testing, Operational Risk and Compliance 
independently identify areas of heightened operational 
risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the 
LOBs and Corporate. 
Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk 
and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate 
in the development and implementation of action 
plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate 
risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate 
LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. 
Operational Risk and Compliance has established 
standards designed to ensure that consistent 
operational risk reporting and operational risk reports 
are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the 
LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the 
evaluation of key risk and performance indicators 
against established thresholds as well as the 
assessment of different types of operational risk 
against stated risk appetite. The standards establish 
escalation protocols to senior management and to the 
Board of Directors.
Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be 
mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. 
The Firm purchases insurance from commercial 
insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, 
Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be 
required by third parties with whom the Firm does 
business.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories include Compliance 
risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and 
Model risk. Refer to pages 157, 158, 159 and 160, 
respectively for more information on Compliance, 
Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. 
Details on other select examples of operational risks 
such as business and technology resiliency, payment 
fraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as 
cybersecurity, are provided below. 
Firmwide resiliency risk 
Disruptions of the Firm’s business and operations can 
occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as 
the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe 
weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate 
change, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a 
third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, 
civil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firm’s 
resiliency framework is intended to enable the Firm to 
prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and 
withstand and recover from, and address adverse 
effects on its operations caused by, disruptions that 
may impact critical business functions and supporting 
assets, including its staff, technology, data and 
facilities, as well as those of third-party service 
providers. The framework includes governance, 
awareness training, planning and testing of recovery 
strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to 
identify, assess, and manage resiliency risks. The 
framework operates in accordance with the Firm’s 
overall approach to Operational Risk Management, 
including alignment with technology, cybersecurity, 
data, physical security, crisis management, real estate 
and outsourcing programs.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. 
The Firm employs various controls for managing 
payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and 
client education and awareness trainings.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-
affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs 
and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The 
objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers 
and other third parties to an appropriate standard of 
operational performance and to mitigate key risks, 
including data loss and business disruptions. The 
Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible 
for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and 
standards with respect to third-party outsourcing 
risks.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting 
from misuse or abuse of technology or the 
unauthorized disclosure of data. 
Overview
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously 
evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are 
devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of 
computer systems, software, networks, storage 
devices, and other technology. The Firm’s security 
efforts are designed to protect against, among other 
things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in 
unauthorized access to confidential information, the 
destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of 
service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. 
The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will 
continue to experience, a higher volume and 
complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of 
heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has 
implemented measures and controls reasonably 
designed to address this evolving environment, 
including enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the 
Firm continues to review and enhance its capabilities 
to address associated risks, such as those relating to 
the management of administrative access to systems.
Third parties with which the Firm does business, that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, 
supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central 
depositories, and financial intermediaries) or that the 
Firm has acquired are also sources of cybersecurity 
risk to the Firm. Third party incidents such as system 
breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees 
of such parties, or cyber attacks, including 
ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could 
have a material adverse effect on the Firm, including in 
circumstances in which an affected third party is 
unable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
where the incident delivers compromised software to 
the Firm or results in lost or compromised information 
of the Firm or its clients or customers.
Clients and customers are also sources of 
cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information 
assets, particularly when their activities and systems 
are beyond the Firm’s own security and control 
systems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions 
with its clients, customers and other external parties 
concerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities 
to improve cybersecurity.
Risks from cybersecurity threats, including any 
previous cybersecurity events, have not materially 
affected the Firm or its business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the 
comprehensive approach that the Firm takes to 
address cybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be 
successful in preventing or mitigating a future 
cybersecurity incident that could have a material 
adverse effect on the Firm or its business strategy, 
results of operations or financial condition.
Organization and management 
The Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) 
reports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a 
member of key cybersecurity governance forums. The 
CISO leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology 
Controls organization, which is responsible for 
identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and for 
implementing and maintaining controls to manage 
cybersecurity threats. The CISO and the members of 
senior management within Global Technology and the 
Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organizations 
all have relevant expertise and experience in 
cybersecurity and information technology risk 
management, including relevant experience at the 
Firm, at other financial services companies or in other 
highly-regulated industries.
The CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information 
Security Program, which is designed to prevent, detect 
and respond to cyber attacks in order to help 
safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability 
of the Firm's infrastructure, resources and information. 
The program includes managing the Firm’s global 
cybersecurity operations centers, providing training, 
conducting cybersecurity event simulation exercises, 
implementing the Firm’s policies and standards 
relating to technology risk and cybersecurity 
management, and enhancing, as needed, the Firm’s 
cybersecurity capabilities. 
The Firm’s Information Security Program includes the 
following functions:
Cyber Operations, which is responsible for 
implementing and maintaining controls designed to 
detect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and 
includes a dedicated function for incident response 
and ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and 
vulnerabilities, including those among the Firm’s third-
party suppliers.
Technology Governance, Risk & Controls, which is 
responsible for operationalizing technology risk and 
control frameworks, analyzing regulatory 
developments that may impact the Firm, and 
developing control catalogs and assessments of 
controls, as well as overseeing governance and 
reporting of technology and cybersecurity risk.
Security Awareness, which provides awareness and 
training that reinforces information risk and security 
management practices and compliance with the Firm's 
policies, standards and practices. The training is 
mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic 
basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing 
initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm 
also provides specialized security training to  
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
155
employees in specific roles, such as application 
developers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program 
requires all employees to take periodic training on 
data privacy that focuses on confidentiality and 
security, as well as responding to unauthorized access 
to or use of information.
Technology Resiliency, which establishes control 
requirements for planning and testing the prioritized 
recovery of technology services in the event of 
degradation or outage, including incident response 
planning, data backup and retention, and recovery 
readiness in support of the Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program and operational risk management 
practices.
The Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan 
designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted 
cybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate 
with law enforcement and other government agencies, 
notify clients and customers, as applicable, and 
recover from such incidents. In addition, the Firm 
actively partners with appropriate government and law 
enforcement agencies and peer industry forums, 
participating in discussions and simulations to assist in 
understanding the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks 
and in enhancing defenses and improving resiliency in 
the Firm’s operating environment.
Governance and oversight
The governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity 
and Technology Controls organization is designed to 
appropriately identify, escalate and mitigate 
cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risk management 
and its governance and oversight are integrated into 
the Firm’s operational risk management framework, 
including through the escalation of key risk and control 
issues to management and the development of risk 
mitigation plans for heightened risk and control issues. 
IRM independently assesses and challenges the 
activities and risk management practices of the Global 
Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization 
related to the identification, assessment, 
measurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As 
needed, the Firm engages third-party assessors or 
auditing firms with industry-recognized expertise on 
cybersecurity matters to review specific aspects of the 
Firm’s cybersecurity risk management framework, 
processes and controls.
The governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk 
management includes governance forums that inform 
management of key areas of concern regarding the 
prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of 
cybersecurity risks. 
The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating 
Committee (“CTOC”) is the principal management 
committee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and 
management of cybersecurity risk, including oversight 
of the implementation and maintenance of appropriate 
controls in support of the Firm’s Information Security 
Program. The membership of the CTOC includes 
senior representatives from the Global Cybersecurity 
and Technology Controls organization and relevant 
corporate functions, including IRM and Internal Audit. 
The CTOC escalates key operational risk and control 
issues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology 
Operating Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control 
committee or to the appropriate LOB and Corporate 
Control Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the 
governance of the Firmwide Global Technology 
organization, including oversight of Firmwide 
technology strategies, the delivery of technology and 
technology operations, the effective use of information 
technology resources, and monitoring and resolving 
key operational risk and control matters arising in the 
Global Technology organization.
As part of its oversight of management’s 
implementation and maintenance of the Firm’s risk 
management framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors 
receives periodic updates from the CIO, the CISO and 
senior members of the CTOC concerning 
cybersecurity matters. These updates generally 
include information regarding cybersecurity and 
technology developments, the Firm’s Information 
Security Program and recommended changes to that 
program, cybersecurity policies and practices, and 
ongoing initiatives to improve information security, as 
well as any significant cybersecurity incidents and the 
Firm's efforts to address those incidents. The Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee assist the Board in 
this oversight.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is 
the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations 
or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 
Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary 
ownership of and accountability for managing their 
compliance risk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and 
Compliance Organization (“Operational Risk and 
Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and 
Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring 
and oversight of business operations with a focus on 
compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations across the LOBs and Corporate, 
and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial 
products and services, relationships and interactions 
with clients and customers, and employee activities. 
For example, compliance risks include those 
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, 
trading activities, market conduct, and complying with 
the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering 
of products and services across jurisdictional borders. 
Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary 
activities, including the failure to exercise the 
applicable standard of care to act in the best interest 
of fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary 
clients and customers fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant 
regulatory obligations that are specific to their 
respective areas of responsibility.
Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies 
and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, 
monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance 
risk.
Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s 
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the CCOR Management 
Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for 
Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also 
provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee 
and the Audit Committee on significant compliance 
risk issues, as appropriate. 
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets 
forth the Firm’s expectation that employees will 
conduct themselves with integrity, at all times. The 
Code provides the principles that help govern 
employee conduct with clients, customers, suppliers, 
vendors, shareholders, regulators, other employees, as 
well as with the markets and communities in which the 
Firm operates. The Code requires employees to 
promptly report any potential or actual violation of the 
Code, Firm policies, or laws, rules or regulations 
applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires 
employees to report any illegal or unethical conduct, 
or conduct that violates the underlying principles of 
the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, 
clients, customers, suppliers, contract or temporary 
workers, or business partners or agents. Training is 
assigned to newly hired employees after joining the 
Firm, and to current employees periodically thereafter. 
Employees are required to affirm their compliance with 
the Code annually. 
Employees can report any potential or actual violations 
of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline (the 
“Hotline”) by phone, mobile device or the internet. The 
Hotline is anonymous, where permitted by law, is 
available at all times globally, has translation services, 
and is administered by an outside service provider. 
The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who 
raises an issue or concern in good faith or assists with 
an inquiry or investigation. Periodically, the Audit 
Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk that any action or misconduct by an employee 
could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, 
impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm 
operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise 
the Firm’s reputation.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying 
and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The 
Business Principles serve as a guide for how 
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With 
the Business Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s 
Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each 
employee and provides information and resources to 
help employees conduct business ethically and in 
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance 
Risk Management on page 157 for further discussion of 
the Code.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s oversight and coordination of conduct risk 
is managed in the same manner as Compliance risk. 
Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 157 for 
further information.
Conduct risk management encompasses various 
aspects of people management practices throughout 
the employee life cycle, including recruiting, 
onboarding, training and development, performance 
management, promotion and compensation 
processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each 
designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews 
metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, 
and provides conduct education as appropriate. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure 
to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law 
in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements 
with clients and customers, and products and services 
offered by the Firm. 
Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal 
services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible 
for managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:
• managing actual and potential litigation and 
enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters
• advising on products and services, including 
contract negotiation and documentation
• advising on offering and marketing documents and 
new business initiatives
• managing dispute resolution
• interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes to them
• advising on advocacy in connection with 
contemplated and proposed laws, rules and 
regulations, and 
• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and 
the Board. 
Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel 
for the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is 
engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts 
Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions 
that may have the potential to create conflicts of 
interest for the Firm. 
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide 
Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. 
The Firm’s General Counsel and other members of 
Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s 
Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee. 
Legal serves on and advises various committees and 
advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential 
reputation risk issues.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
159
ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of 
operational risk, is the potential for adverse 
consequences from decisions based on incorrect or 
misused estimation outputs. 
The Firm uses models and other analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, including those based 
upon machine learning or artificial intelligence 
techniques, across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such 
as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, 
assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting 
stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit 
losses and making business decisions. A dedicated 
independent function, Model Risk Governance and 
Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s 
policies relating to the management of model risk and 
risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-
based estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning 
and analysis. 
Model risks are owned by the users of the models 
within the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific 
purposes of such models. Users and developers of 
models are responsible for developing, implementing 
and testing their models, as well as referring models to 
MRGR for review and approval. Once models have 
been approved, model users and developers are 
responsible for maintaining a robust operating 
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. 
Model users and developers may seek to enhance 
models in response to changes in the relevant 
portfolios and in product and market developments, as 
well as to capture improvements in available modeling 
techniques and systems capabilities. 
Models are tiered based on an internal standard 
according to their complexity, the exposure associated 
with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. 
This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its 
review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model 
is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be 
used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and 
challenges the model methodology and the 
reasonableness of model assumptions, and may 
perform or require additional testing, including back-
testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are 
approved by the appropriate level of management 
within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new 
models, as well as material changes to existing 
models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, 
exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to 
allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. 
MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate 
actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in 
the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading 
activity.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the 
market or economic environment. This is particularly 
true when the current and forecasted environments 
are significantly different from the historical 
environments upon which the models were developed. 
This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater 
degree of judgment and analytics to inform any 
adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs 
than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the Firm 
may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates 
if assets acquired differ from those used to develop 
the models.   
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the 
Firm on pages 161–164 and Note 2 for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation 
techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of 
estimates are integral to understanding its reported 
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting 
estimates require management’s judgment to 
ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and 
liabilities. The Firm has established policies and 
control procedures intended to ensure that estimation 
methods, including any judgments made as part of 
such methods, are well-controlled, independently 
reviewed and applied consistently from period to 
period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk 
management strategies, which may vary across the 
Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the 
policies and procedures are intended to ensure that 
the process for changing methodologies occurs in an 
appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates 
for determining the carrying value of its assets and 
liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief 
description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over 
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The 
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:
• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the 
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),
• The allowance for lending-related commitments, 
and
• The allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including 
development and weighting of macroeconomic 
forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, 
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk 
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination 
of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 
13 for further information on these judgments as well 
as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to 
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses 
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to 
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast 
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of 
macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant 
for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than 
twenty variables. The specific variables that have the 
greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio 
and geography.
• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include 
regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.
• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. 
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil 
prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. 
HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its 
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at 
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in 
the estimate from one reporting period to the next.
As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm 
recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans 
acquired and lending-related commitments assumed 
as of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in risk rating 
methodologies for the First Republic portfolio and the 
ongoing integration of products and systems, the 
allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale 
portfolio was initially measured based on similar risk 
characteristics from other facilities underwritten by 
the Firm. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, the 
acquired portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's 
modeled credit loss estimates and is now reflected in 
the wholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 
34 for additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition. 
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any 
one factor or input might affect the overall allowance 
for credit losses because management considers a 
wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the 
allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and 
inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and 
may not be consistent across all geographies or 
product types, and changes in factors and inputs may 
be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in 
one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the 
modeled credit losses determined using its central 
and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which 
are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating 
the allowances for loan losses and lending-related 
commitments. The central and relative adverse 
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but 
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 137 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
161
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1% 
higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak 
difference of approximately 3.0% in the fourth quarter 
of 2025.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected 
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a 
number of reasons, including:
• The allowance as of December 31, 2024, reflects 
credit losses beyond those estimated under the 
central scenario due to the weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios.
• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this 
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more 
severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 
• Expectations of future changes in portfolio 
composition and borrower behavior can significantly 
affect the allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates 
to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2024, 
the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its 
relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. 
Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in 
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance 
for credit losses, the comparison between these two 
scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following 
differences:
• An increase of approximately $850 million for 
residential real estate loans and lending-related 
commitments
• An increase of approximately $3.7 billion for credit 
card loans
• An increase of approximately $4.1 billion for 
wholesale loans and lending-related commitments
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in 
the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not 
reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to 
the quantitative calculation, which would also be 
influenced by the judgment management applies to 
the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the 
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime 
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic 
conditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes 
that its process to consider the available information 
and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately 
governed and that its estimates of expected credit 
losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period 
ended December 31, 2024.
Fair value
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and 
liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis, including derivatives, structured note products 
and certain securities financing agreements. Certain 
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home 
equity and other loans, where the carrying value is 
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets 
measured at fair value and the portion of such assets 
that are classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

Management’s discussion and analysis
162
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair 
value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value 
requires the application of judgment. The type and level 
of judgment required is largely dependent on the 
amount of observable market information available to 
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally 
developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and 
are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are 
more significant than those required when estimating 
the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 
and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation 
technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of 
certain significant inputs requires management to 
assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation 
inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield 
curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default 
rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and 
credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of 
the valuation of level 3 instruments, including 
unobservable inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, 
management judgment must be applied to assess the 
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect 
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, 
market funding rates, liquidity considerations, 
unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet 
specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. 
The judgments made are typically affected by the type 
of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly 
for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a 
further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by 
the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs 
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss 
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while 
the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate 
and consistent with those of other market participants, 
the methods and assumptions used reflect 
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s 
businesses and portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions 
in the determination of fair value. The use of 
methodologies or assumptions different than those 
used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of 
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a 
detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and 
hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for 
individual financial instruments.
Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to 
reporting units and tested for impairment at least 
annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to 
conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in 
Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with 
each business combination is allocated to the related 
reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm 
reviewed current economic conditions, estimated 
market cost of equity, as well as actual business results 
and projections of business performance. Based on 
such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was 
not impaired as of December 31, 2024. For each of the 
reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at 
least 10% and there was no indication of a significant 
risk of goodwill impairment based on current 
projections and valuations. 
The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are 
consistent with management’s current business outlook 
assumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best 
estimates of long-term growth and return on equity in 
the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-
party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and 
estimates.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2024.
Credit card rewards liability
JPMorganChase offers credit cards with various 
rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn 
rewards points based on their account activity and the 
terms and conditions of the rewards program. 
Generally, there are no limits on the points that an 
eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, 
and the points can be redeemed for a variety of 
rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of 
account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected 
to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued 
as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when 
the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $14.4 
billion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The 
increase in the liability was driven by continued growth 
in rewards points earned on higher spend and 
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 
2024.
The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate 
(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
163
assumption is used to estimate the number of points 
earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life 
of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate 
the cost of future point redemptions. These 
assumptions are evaluated periodically considering 
historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and 
management judgment. Updates to these assumptions 
will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 
2024, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 
1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability 
by approximately $442 million.
Income taxes 
JPMorganChase is subject to the income tax laws of the 
various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
These laws are often complex and may be subject to 
different interpretations. To determine the financial 
statement impact of accounting for income taxes, 
including the provision for income tax expense and 
unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorganChase must make 
assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and 
apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions 
and business events, as well as make judgments 
regarding the timing of when certain items may affect 
taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
JPMorganChase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the 
various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the 
Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its 
view on a tax position. These disputes over 
interpretations with the various taxing authorities may 
be settled by audit, administrative appeals or 
adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions 
in which the Firm operates. JPMorganChase regularly 
reviews whether it may be assessed additional income 
taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and 
the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, 
as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its 
estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax 
laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is 
possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income 
taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets 
and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus 
income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized if, in management’s judgment, their 
realizability is determined to be more likely than not. 
Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates 
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in 
which those temporary differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a 
change in tax rates is recognized within the provision 
for income taxes in the period enacted.
The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax 
credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular 
reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are 
realizable. These reviews include management’s 
estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable 
income, including foreign source income, and may 
incorporate various tax planning strategies, including 
strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and 
FTCs before they expire. In connection with these 
reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is 
not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The 
valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent 
reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on 
revised estimates of future taxable income or changes 
in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that 
all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of December 31, 2024, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing 
valuation allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as 
necessary when new information becomes available, 
including changes in tax law and regulations, and 
interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax 
positions that meet the more-likely-than-not 
recognition threshold are measured to determine the 
amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may have a material impact on its effective 
income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment 
occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates 
are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different 
from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax 
provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final 
outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts 
recorded, such differences will generally impact the 
Firm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which 
such a determination is made.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred 
tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the 
subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns 
are generally recorded in the period when the tax 
returns are filed and the global tax implications are 
known, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate.

taxes.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make 
forward-looking statements. These statements can be 
identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to 
historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements 
often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” 
“estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other 
words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements 
provide JPMorganChase’s current expectations or 
forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or 
aspirations. JPMorganChase’s disclosures in this 2024 
Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements within 
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking 
statements in its other documents filed or furnished with 
the SEC. In addition, the Firm’s senior management may 
make forward-looking statements orally to investors, 
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue products 
and services, and the extent to which products or 
services previously sold by the Firm require the Firm 
to incur liabilities or absorb losses not contemplated 
at their initiation or origination;
• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products 
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the 
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;
• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified 
employees;
• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of 
certain assets and liabilities;
• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or 
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread 
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an 
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other 
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate change 
or extraordinary events beyond the Firm’s control, and 
the Firm’s ability to deal effectively with disruptions 
caused by the foregoing;
• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its 
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and 
other operational systems and facilities;

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
(“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial 
reporting is a process designed by, or under the 
supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and 
principal financial officers, or persons performing 
similar functions, and effected by JPMorganChase’s 
Board of Directors, management and other personnel, 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
JPMorganChase’s internal control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of 
JPMorganChase’s management and directors; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Management has completed an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making the 
assessment, management used the “Internal Control — 
Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of December 31, 2024, 
JPMorganChase’s internal control over financial 
reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 
framework. Additionally, based upon management’s 
assessment, the Firm determined that there were no 
material weaknesses in its internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an 
independent registered public accounting firm, as 
stated in their report which appears herein.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its 
subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, comprehensive income, changes in 
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including 
the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”). We also have 
audited the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 
2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
Basis for Opinions
The Firm’s management is responsible for these 
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on 
the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the 
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on 
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered 
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules 
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements are free of material misstatement, whether 
due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal 
control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements 
included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. 
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, 
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits 
also included performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and 
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are 
matters arising from the current period audit of the 
consolidated financial statements that were 
communicated or required to be communicated to the 
audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or 
disclosures that are material to the consolidated 
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially 
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The 
communication of critical audit matters does not alter 
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matters below, 
providing separate opinions on the critical audit 
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.
Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based 
component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan 
Portfolios 
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the allowance for loan losses for the 
portfolio-based component of the wholesale and 
credit card loan portfolios was $22.0 billion on total 
portfolio-based retained loans of $919.3 billion at 
December 31, 2024. The Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses represents management’s estimate of expected 
credit losses over the remaining expected life of the 
Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future 
changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-
based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan 
portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of 
expected credit losses over the expected life of the 
loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated 
exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are 
determined based on the weighted average of five 
internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that 
take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as 
derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, 
the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment 
and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative 
calculation is further adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that 
are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss 
estimate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the allowance for 
loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the 
wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical 
audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and 
estimation by management in the forecast of 
macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. 
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, 
as the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions 
significantly affect its estimate of expected credit 
losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant 
judgment and estimation by management in 
determining the quantitative calculation utilized in 
their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take 
into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that 
are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss 
estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor 
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing 
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained 
relating to the credit loss estimates and the 
appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss 
estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing 
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in 
connection with forming our overall opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness of controls relating 
to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including 
controls over model validation and generation of 
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also 
included, among others, testing management’s 
process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, 
which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of 
the models and methodologies used in quantitative 
calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of 
forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross 
domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and 
accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) 
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s 
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts 
of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, 
trends and other subjective factors that are not yet 
otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These 
procedures also included the use of professionals with 
specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating 
the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies 
and macroeconomic variables.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements, the Firm carries $1.5 trillion of its 
assets and $586.2 billion of its liabilities at fair value on 
a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $10.9 
billion of trading assets and $51.8 billion of liabilities 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively 
financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as 
they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are 
unobservable and significant to their fair value 
measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed 
valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate 
fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The 
unobservable inputs used by management to estimate 
the fair value of certain of these financial instruments 
include interest rate volatility, equity volatility, 
Bermudan switch value and correlation relating to 
interest rates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange, 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
170
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange and equity-
to-interest rate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the fair value of 
certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit 
matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation 
by management in determining the inputs to estimate 
fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor 
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing 
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained 
related to the fair value of these financial instruments, 
and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing 
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in 
connection with forming our overall opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness of controls relating 
to the Firm’s determination of the fair value, including 
controls over models, inputs, and data. These 
procedures also included, among others, the 
involvement of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in developing an independent 
estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial 
instruments and comparing management’s estimate 
to the independently developed estimate of fair value. 
Developing the independent estimate involved testing 
the completeness and accuracy of data provided by 
management, developing independent inputs and, as 
appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s 
aforementioned unobservable inputs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Consolidated statements of cash flows
176
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the 
“Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated 
under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial 
services firm based in the U.S., with operations 
worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, 
financial services for consumers and small businesses, 
commercial banking, financial transaction processing 
and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further 
discussion of the Firm's reportable business 
segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of 
JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. 
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies 
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines 
prescribed by regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the 
accounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in 
which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All 
material intercompany balances and transactions have 
been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary 
capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase 
and are not included on the Consolidated balance 
sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling 
financial interest in an entity by first evaluating 
whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a 
variable interest entity. 
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient 
equity and provide the equity investors voting rights 
that enable them to make significant decisions relating 
to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, 
the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling 
interest is primarily based on the amount of voting 
equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a 
controlling financial interest, through ownership of the 
majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or 
through other contractual rights that give the Firm 
control, are consolidated by the Firm.
Investments in companies in which the Firm has 
significant influence over operating and financing 
decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting 
equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance 
with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair 
value if the fair value option was elected. These 
investments are generally included in other assets, 
with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.
Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are 
structured as limited partnerships or limited liability 
companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the 
general partner or managing member, but the non-
affiliated partners or members have the ability to 
remove the Firm as the general partner or managing 
member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on 
a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or 
members have rights to participate in important 
decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate 
these voting interest entities. However, in the limited 
cases where the non-managing partners or members 
do not have substantive kick-out or participating 
rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and 
consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general 
partner or managing member and has both power and 
a potentially significant interest. 
The Firm’s investment companies and asset 
management funds have investments in both publicly-
held and privately-held entities, including investments 
in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. 
These investments are accounted for under 
investment company guidelines and, accordingly, 
irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership 
interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance 
sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, 
with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If 
consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under 
such specialized investment company guidelines.
Variable interest entities 
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack 
sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its 
activities without additional subordinated financial 
support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors 
that do not have the ability to make significant 
decisions relating to the entity’s operations through 
voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb 
the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive 
the residual returns of the entity.
The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are 
commonly used in securitization transactions in order 
to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows 
from those assets to investors. The basic SPE 
structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; 
the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing 
securities to investors. The legal documents that 
govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on 
the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors 
and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. 
SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors 
from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other 
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the 
assets. 
The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has 
a controlling financial interest) is required to 
consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the 
power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; 
and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation 
to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from 
the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the 
VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all 
the facts and circumstances, including its role in 
establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and 
responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, 
identifying the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance; and second, 
identifying which party, if any, has power over those 
activities. In general, the parties that make the most 
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset 
managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of 
call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) 
or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-
makers are deemed to have the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to 
absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the 
VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, 
including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, 
and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be 
variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires 
that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether 
these interests, in the aggregate, are considered 
potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in 
assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, 
including its capitalization structure; subordination of 
interests; payment priority; relative share of interests 
held across various classes within the VIE’s capital 
structure; and the reasons why the interests are held 
by the Firm.
The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) 
whether entities previously evaluated under the 
majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, 
based on certain events, and are therefore subject to 
the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether 
changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the 
Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s 
consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-
sponsored VIEs.
Revenue recognition 
Interest income 
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt 
securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a 
level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual 
rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.
Revenue from contracts with customers 
JPMorganChase recognizes noninterest revenue from 
certain contracts with customers, in investment 
banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management 
fees, commissions and other fees, and components of 
card income, when the Firm’s related performance 
obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further 
discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with 
customers. 
Principal transactions revenue 
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and 
liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are 
reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair 
value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further 
discussion of principal transactions revenue. 
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual 
results could be different from these estimates.
Foreign currency translation
JPMorganChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue 
and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into 
U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional 
currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are 
included in the Consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to 
nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-
U.S. operations where the functional currency is the 
U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated 
statements of income.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative 
receivables and derivative payables with the same 
counterparty and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables on a net basis on the 
Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. 
GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased 
under repurchase agreements and securities 
borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements 
to be presented net when specified conditions are met, 
including the existence of a legally enforceable master 
netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such 
balances where it has determined that the specified 
conditions are met.
The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, 
including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, 
securities borrowed and securities loaned 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
178
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
agreements. A master netting agreement is a single 
agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple 
transactions governed by that agreement to be 
terminated or accelerated and settled through a single 
payment in a single currency in the event of a default 
(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment 
or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin 
when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives 
termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all 
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are 
valued and the positive values of “in the money” 
transactions are netted against the negative values of 
“out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only 
remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties 
to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise 
of default rights under repurchase agreements and 
securities loan agreements in general (i) all 
transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all 
values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are 
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each 
other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is 
of one of the parties to pay the netted termination 
amount.
Typical master netting agreements for these types of 
transactions also often contain a collateral/margin 
agreement that provides for a security interest in, or 
title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to 
the party that has the right to demand margin (the 
“demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement 
typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin 
to the demanding party with a value equal to the 
amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all 
transactions governed by the master netting 
agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin 
agreement grants to the demanding party, upon 
default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any 
amounts payable by the counterparty against any 
posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted 
collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding 
party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to 
apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the 
counterparty.
Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s 
derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further 
discussion of the Firm’s securities financing 
agreements. 
Statements of cash flows
For JPMorganChase’s Consolidated statements of 
cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included 
in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024
Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for 
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the 
Proportional Amortization Method 
The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented 
investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit 
investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by 
program basis, to be accounted for using the 
proportional amortization method. This method 
requires the cost of eligible investments, within an 
elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the 
tax benefits received with the resulting amortization 
reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns 
with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. 
Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, 
including that substantially all of the return is from 
income tax credits and other income tax benefits.
This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under 
the modified retrospective method. The adoption of 
this guidance resulted in a change to the classification 
and timing of the amortization associated with certain 
of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented 
investments. As a result of the adoption, the 
amortization of these investments that was previously 
recognized in other income is now recognized in 
income tax expense. The change in accounting 
resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $161 
million and increased the Firm’s income tax expense 
and the effective tax rate by approximately $450 
million and two percentage points, respectively, in the 
first quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net 
income.
The guidance requires additional disclosure for all 
investments that generate income tax credits and 
other income tax benefits from a tax-oriented 
investment program for which the Firm has elected to 
apply the proportional amortization method. The 
guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible 
investments when significant modifications or events 
occur that result in a change in the nature of the 
investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with 
the underlying project.
Refer to Notes 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023
Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – 
Portfolio Layer Method
The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to 
hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying 
hedge accounting relationship. As permitted by the 
guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities 
to AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio 
layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption 
impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not 
material.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled 
Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) 
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the 
requirement to measure the allowance for TDRs using 
a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology and 
allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based 
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. 
The Firm elected this option for all portfolios of 
modified loans to troubled borrowers except 
collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated 
loans, for which the Firm elected to continue applying 
a DCF methodology. The adoption of this guidance 
under the modified retrospective method on January 1, 
2023, resulted in a $446 million increase to retained 
earnings.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and 
liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are 
predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis 
(i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and 
reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and 
unfunded lending-related commitments are measured 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are 
not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are 
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain 
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of 
impairment).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted 
market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or 
quotes are not available, fair value is based on 
valuation models and other valuation techniques that 
consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as 
maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or 
unobservable market parameters, including yield 
curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, 
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value 
may also incorporate valuation adjustments. 
The level of precision in estimating unobservable 
market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of 
gain or loss recorded for a particular position. 
Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation 
methods are appropriate and consistent with those of 
other market participants, the methods and 
assumptions used reflect management judgment and 
may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. 
The Firm uses various methodologies and 
assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use 
of different methodologies or assumptions by other 
market participants compared with those used by the 
Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different 
estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 
Valuation process 
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair 
value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s 
Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the 
Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-
taking functions, is responsible for verifying these 
estimates and determining any fair value adjustments 
that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s 
positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the 
Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives, is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks 
arising from valuation activities conducted across the 
Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide 
head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s 
Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, 
CCB, AWM and certain corporate functions including 
Treasury and CIO. 
Price verification process 
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the 
risk-taking functions by leveraging independently 
derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, 
where available. Where independent prices or inputs 
are not available, the VCG performs additional review 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The 
additional review may include evaluating the limited 
market activity including client unwinds, 
benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for 
similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of 
structured instruments into individual components, 
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing 
profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in 
collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of 
management review for more significant or complex 
positions.
The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that 
may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-
taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are 
applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the 
fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion of the fair 
value hierarchy on page 182 for further information). 
For other positions, judgment is required to assess the 
need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect 
liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, 
and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, 
the size of the net open risk position. The 
determination of such adjustments follows a 
consistent framework across the Firm:
• Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered 
where an observable external price or valuation 
parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially 
due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation 
adjustments are made based on current market 
conditions. Factors that may be considered in 
determining the liquidity adjustment include 
analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the 
instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing 
points for similar instruments in active markets; and 
(3) the range of reasonable values that the price or 
parameter could take. 
• The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial 
instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure 
and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to 
estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis 
of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an 
orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation 
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of 
exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open 
risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
181
based on factors that a relevant market participant 
would consider in the transfer of the net open risk 
position, including the size of the adverse market 
move that is likely to occur during the period 
required to sufficiently reduce the net open risk 
position. 
• Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable 
parameters may be made when positions are valued 
using prices or input parameters to valuation models 
that are unobservable due to a lack of market 
activity or because they cannot be implied from 
observable market data. Such prices or parameters 
must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to 
management judgment. Adjustments are made to 
reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting 
valuation estimate. 
• Where appropriate, the Firm also applies 
adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to 
appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality 
(CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and 
the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent 
framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and 
funding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for 
more information on such adjustments.
Valuation model review and approval 
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument 
or a similar instrument, fair value is generally 
determined using valuation models that consider 
relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as 
inputs market-based or independently sourced 
parameters. Where this is the case the price 
verification process described above is applied to the 
inputs in those models. 
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new 
models, as well as material changes to existing 
models, prior to implementation in the operating 
environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may 
be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be 
used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also 
require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate 
the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These 
actions will depend on the model and may include, for 
example, limitation of trading activity. 
Fair value hierarchy 
A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established 
under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value 
measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on 
the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset 
or liability as of the measurement date. The three 
levels are defined as follows. 
• Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are 
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. 
• Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology 
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in active markets, and inputs that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for 
substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
• Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation 
methodology are unobservable and significant to the 
fair value measurement. 
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair 
value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that 
consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment 
structure of the note.
The embedded derivative features are considered using models 
such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation 
models, or a combination of models that may use observable or 
unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded 
derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature 
of the embedded derivative features, as described in the 
discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments 
are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own 
credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 198 of this Note.

(a) At December 31, 2024 and 2023, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $120.1 billion and $78.5 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-
related.
(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term 
defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the 
Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying 
value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in 
fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure 
information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short 
positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not 
required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include 
certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.0 billion, primarily reported in other assets.
(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral 
received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, 
including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for 
determining fair value, including for instruments where 
fair value is estimated using significant unobservable 
inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 181–185 of this Note for 
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and 
a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value 
for individual financial instruments. 
Estimating fair value requires the application of 
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is 
largely dependent on the amount of observable market 
information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those 
required when estimating the fair value of instruments 
classified within levels 1 and 2. 
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation 
technique to use. Second, due to the lack of 
observability of significant inputs, management must 
assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation 
inputs including transaction details, yield curves, 
interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, 
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, 
equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable 
instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. 
The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, 
the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values 
for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic 
averages of such inputs. While the determination to 
classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the 
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall 
fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments 
typically include observable components (that is, 
components that are actively quoted and can be 
validated to external sources) in addition to the 
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 
inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm 
manages the risk of the observable components of level 
3 financial instruments using securities and derivative 
positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy. 
The range of values presented in the table is 
representative of the highest and lowest level input 
used to value the significant groups of instruments 
within a product/instrument classification. Where 
provided, the weighted averages of the input values 
presented in the table are calculated based on the fair 
value of the instruments that the input is being used to 
value. 
In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and 
arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of 
input uncertainty or an assessment of the 
reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and 
assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of 
the various instruments held by the Firm and the 
relative distribution of instruments within the range of 
characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and 
valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly 
different implied volatility levels because the option 
contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike 
prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic 
average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at 
each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every 
instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $488 million, nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $368 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $18 million, trading loans of $65 million and non-trading loans of $1.3 billion. 
(d) Comprises trading loans of $1.0 billion and non-trading loans of $707 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The 
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f)
Includes equity securities of $734 million including $672 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are 
insignificant both individually and in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on 
price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i)
Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs 
The following discussion provides a description of the 
impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each 
unobservable input in isolation, and the 
interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where 
relevant and significant. The impact of changes in 
inputs may not be independent, as a change in one 
unobservable input may give rise to a change in another 
unobservable input. Where relationships do exist 
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships 
are discussed below. Relationships may also exist 
between observable and unobservable inputs (for 
example, as observable interest rates rise, 
unobservable prepayment rates decline); such 
relationships have not been included in the discussion 
below. In addition, for each of the individual 
relationships described below, the inverse relationship 
would also generally apply. 
The following discussion also provides a description of 
attributes of the underlying instruments and external 
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in 
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. 
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to 
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of 
additional annualized return over the market interest 
rate that a market participant would demand for taking 
exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit 
spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate 
used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, 
an increase in the credit spread would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. 
The yield and the credit spread of a particular 
mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk 
inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by 
the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument 
(which may not correspond directly to the level of 
inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit 
spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various 
instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in 
mortgage-backed securities is driven by the 
subordination of the security being valued and the 
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the 
collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, 
LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of 
the property and/or any tenants for commercial 
mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of 
U.S. states and municipalities and other similar 
instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of 
the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. 
Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a 
measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal 
repayments of a prepayable obligation in a 
collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally 
decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in 
prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued 
at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value 
measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. 
Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to 
collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location 
of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of 
the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or 
floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. 
Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit 
quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with 
lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being 
equal. 
Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is 
a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral 
balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a 
result of defaults. While there is typically no direct 
relationship between conditional default rates and 
prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which 
the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds 
will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An 
increase in conditional default rates would generally be 
accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an 
increase in credit spreads. An increase in the 
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional 
default rates reflect the quality of the collateral 
underlying a securitization and the structure of the 
securitization itself. Based on the types of securities 
owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, 
conditional default rates are most typically at the lower 
end of the range presented. 
Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is 
the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future 
realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of 
a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss 
relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in 
loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in 
conditional default rates. An increase in the loss 
severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair 
value measurement. 
The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed 
security depends on factors relating to the underlying 
mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the 
lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-
specific factors.

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the 
relationship between the movements of two variables. 
Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product 
where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying 
risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of 
derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign 
exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the 
underlying risks. When parameters are positively 
correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an 
increase in the other parameter. When parameters are 
negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will 
result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase 
in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a 
fair value measurement. Given a short correlation 
position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would 
generally result in a decrease in a fair value 
measurement.
The level of correlation used in the valuation of 
derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a 
number of factors including the nature of those risks. 
For example, the correlation between two credit risk 
exposures would be different than that between two 
interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the 
transaction may also impact the correlation input, as 
the relationship between the underlying risks may be 
different over different time periods. Furthermore, 
correlation levels are dependent on market conditions 
and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or 
across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile 
market conditions. 
Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in 
possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market 
index given how much the particular instrument, 
parameter or index changes in value over time. 
Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity 
options, commodity options, and interest rate options. 
Given a long position in an option, an increase in 
volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an 
increase in a fair value measurement. 
The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular 
option-based derivative depends on a number of 
factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the 
option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security 
may be significantly different from that of a particular 
commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as 
the strike price of the option. 
Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the 
difference between the overall value of a Bermudan 
swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in 
time, and its most expensive European swaption and 
reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise 
dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent 
on market conditions and can vary greatly depending 
on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the 
underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. 
An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally 
result in an increase in a fair value measurement.
Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents 
the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. 
The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and 
foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a 
pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative 
cash flow.  
Forward price – The forward price is the price at which 
the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a 
forward contract on the predetermined future delivery 
date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at 
inception. 
The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of 
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors 
including interest rates, the current price of the 
underlying asset, and the expected income to be 
received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a 
result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An 
increase in the forward can result in an increase or a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 
The following tables include a rollforward of the 
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including 
changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified 
by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for 
the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
When a determination is made to classify a financial 
instrument within level 3, the determination is based on 
the significance of the unobservable inputs to the 
overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 
financial instruments typically include, in addition to the 
unobservable or level 3 components, observable 
components (that is, components that are actively 
quoted and can be validated to external sources); 
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below 
include changes in fair value due in part to observable 
factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The 
Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 
3 financial instruments using securities and derivative 
positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk 
management instruments are not included below, the 
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the 
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related 
to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes 
The following describes significant changes to level 3 
assets since December 31, 2023, for those items 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis on page 199 for further information 
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis.

Level 3 assets were $23.8 billion at December 31, 2024, 
reflecting an increase of $127 million from December 31, 
2023.
The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
driven by:
• $599 million increase in MSRs.
• $586 million increase in other assets primarily due to 
purchases,
offset by:
• $472 million decrease in gross derivative receivables 
due to sales and settlements predominantly offset by

• $663 million decrease in non-trading loans due to 
sales and settlements largely offset by gains, 
purchases and net transfers.
Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs.
Refer to the sections below for additional information.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use 
as their basis observable market parameters. These 
market parameters generally do not consider factors 
such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s 
own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is 
generally necessary to make adjustments to the base 
estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.
CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the 
relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect 
counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm 
estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate 
the expected positive credit exposure across all of the 
Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and 
then estimates losses based on the probability of 
default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a 
counterparty credit event considering contractual 
factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit 
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. 
The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the 
probability of a default event occurring for each 
counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated 
CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied 
by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences 
in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to 
those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect 
senior unsecured creditor risk.
FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of 
funding and is recognized where there is evidence that 
a market participant in the principal market would 
incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The 
Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized 
(including partially collateralized) over-the-counter 
(“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) 
the expected funding requirements arising from the 
Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral 
arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding 
cost in the principal market which, for derivative 
liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For 
collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by 
discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant 
overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying 
collateral agreement with the counterparty, and 
therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of credit and 
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue 
in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any 
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented 
below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit 
quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the 
impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over 
time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected 
liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair 
value option has been elected requires consideration 
of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option 
elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the 
issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of 
default and LGD, which are estimated based on 
changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the 
bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for 
fair value option elected liabilities are reported in 
principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/
losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 196 in this 
Note and Note 24 for further information.

(a)  Included equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly 
transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.0 billion in level 3 assets 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2024, $668 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the 
measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the 
restrictions on the shares. Also, included impairments on certain equity method investments.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), 
plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., 
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.   
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if 
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to 
reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the 
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. 
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as 
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments 
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are 
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6 million Visa Class B-2 common shares 
("Visa B-2 shares") and 37.2 million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) reflected in the Firm's principal 
investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Visa B shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) on January 24, 2024. 
On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa B-1 shares. On May 6, 
2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million Visa B-1 shares in exchange 
for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in an initial gain of 
$8.0 billion based on the fair value of the Visa C shares. In addition, the second quarter of 2024 also reflected other 
Visa-related activity, including the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and derivative instruments, as well as 
dividends, resulting in the $7.9 billion net gain on Visa shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had 
disposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales in the second and third quarters of 2024  and through a $1.0 billion 
contribution to the Firm’s Foundation in the second quarter of 2024. 
The Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares 
(“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The 
conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was  1.5430 at December 31, 2024  and may be adjusted by Visa 
depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect 
that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 
2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated 
and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as 
differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their 
nominal carryover basis. 
Separately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments 
with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion 
rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent 
changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The 
payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B-2 shares associated with the 
previously sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at 
fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of 
final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in 
fair value are recognized in other income. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative 
instruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm held 
derivative instruments associated with 11.6 million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which 
are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of 
financial instruments that are not carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair 
value of certain financial instruments, which are 
included in the following table. However, this table 
does not include other items, such as nonfinancial 
assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, 
and customer relationships. In the opinion of 
management, these items, in the aggregate, add 
significant value to JPMorganChase.
Financial instruments for which carrying value 
approximates fair value 
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried 
at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their 
short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. 
These instruments include cash and due from banks, 
deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest 
receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds 
purchased, securities loaned and sold under 
repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and 
accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that 
the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated 
maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money 
market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; 
recognition of the inherent funding value of these 
instruments is not permitted. 
The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at 
fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including 
principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, 
prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of 
the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s 
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is 
generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect 
the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.
(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.

accordance with the contract.  Refer to page 183 of this Note for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related 
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair 
value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, 
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan 
commitments.
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments 
at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate 
income statement volatility caused by the differences 
between the measurement basis of elected 
instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise 
would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the 
associated risk management arrangements that are 
accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better 
reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair 
value basis. 
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following 
instruments: 
• Loans purchased or originated as part of 
securitization warehousing activity, subject to 
bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value 
basis, including lending-related commitments
• Certain securities financing agreements
• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial 
assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, 
which would otherwise be required to be separately 
accounted for as a derivative instrument 
• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, 
which are predominantly  financial instruments that 
contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or 
transacted as part of client-driven activities 
• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by 
CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the 
underlying assets are carried at fair value

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for 
items for which the fair value option was elected 
The following describes how the gains and losses that 
are attributable to changes in instrument-specific 
credit risk, were determined. 
• Loans and lending-related commitments: For 
floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are 
attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For 
fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes 
in value for the period is made between those 
changes in value that are interest rate-related and 
changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations 
are generally based on an analysis of borrower-
specific credit spread and recovery information, 
where available, or benchmarking to similar entities 
or industries. 
• Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to 
instrument-specific credit risk were derived 
principally from observable changes in the Firm’s 
credit spread as observed in the bond market. 
• Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these 
types of agreements, there is a requirement that 
collateral be maintained with a market value equal to 
or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a 
result, there would be no adjustment or an 
immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit 
risk related to these agreements. 
Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding 
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining 
contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for loans, long-term debt and long-
term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.
(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike 
principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal 
at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of 
principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature 
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-
protected notes.

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of 
clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in 
similar business activities or activities in the same 
geographic region, or when they have similar 
economic features that would cause their ability to 
meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected 
by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments 
of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk 
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral 
when deemed necessary and permitted under the 
Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly 
involved in the credit approval and review process, and 
risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s 
risk appetite.
In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are 
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic 
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations 
at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk 
concentrations can be remedied through changes in 
underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to 
Note 12 for additional information on the geographic 
composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In 
the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are 
evaluated primarily by industry and monitored 
regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on 
an individual client or counterparty basis. 
The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through 
loan syndications and participations, loan sales, 
securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting 
agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction 
techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information 
on loans. 
The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any 
particular loan product or industry segment results in 
a significant concentration of credit risk. 
Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are 
included in the Firm’s assessment when extending 
credit and establishing its allowance for credit losses. 
Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the 
allowance for credit losses.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments 
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying 
asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a 
combination of these factors and may expose 
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying 
asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own 
or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorganChase 
makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses 
derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. 
Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered 
into for market-making or risk management purposes. 
Market-making derivatives 
The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into 
for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to 
mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm 
actively manages the risks from its exposure to these 
derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts 
or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments 
that partially or fully offset the exposure from client 
derivatives. 
Risk management derivatives 
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk 
exposures using derivative instruments, including 
derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other 
derivatives that are used to manage risks associated 
with specified assets and liabilities. 
The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to 
manage the risk associated with changes in interest 
rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or 
depreciate in market value as interest rates change. 
Similarly, interest income and expense increase or 
decrease as a result of variable-rate assets and 
liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a 
result of the repayment and subsequent origination or 
issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current 
market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are 
expected to substantially offset this variability. 
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the 
foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign 
currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and 
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the 
Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries 
or branches whose functional currencies are not the 
U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign 
currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the 
foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or 
the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or 
decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments 
related to these foreign currency–denominated assets 
or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to 
substantially offset this variability. 
Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price 
risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses 
on these derivative instruments are expected to 
substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of 
the related inventory. 
Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty 
credit risk associated with loans and lending-related 
commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the 
purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract 
experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a 
failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives 
primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives 
section on pages 222–224 of this Note for a further 
discussion of credit derivatives. 
Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and 
losses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting 
gains and losses tables on pages 218–221 of this Note 
for more information about risk management 
derivatives. 
Derivative counterparties and settlement types 
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are 
negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative 
counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, 
certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-
cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts 
are generally standardized contracts traded on an 
exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s 
counterparty from the inception of the transactions. 
OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis 
and then novated to the CCP for clearing. 
Derivative clearing services 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which 
the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain 
exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not 
reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for 
further information on the Firm’s clearing services. 
Accounting for derivatives 
All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for 
its own account are required to be recorded on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative 
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable 
master netting agreement exists between the Firm and 
the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further 
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The 
accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends 
on whether or not the transaction has been designated 
and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are 
not designated as hedges are reported and measured 
at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures 
on pages 213–221 of this Note provide additional 
information on the amount of, and reporting for, 
derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to 
Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives 
embedded in structured notes. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
209
Derivatives designated as hedges 
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain 
derivatives executed for risk management purposes – 
generally interest rate, foreign exchange and 
commodity derivatives. However, JPMorganChase 
does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the 
derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk 
management activities. For example, the Firm does 
not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to 
manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related 
commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying 
such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the 
Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain 
interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity 
derivatives used for risk management purposes.  
To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be 
highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the 
exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to 
be designated as a hedge, the risk management 
objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge 
documentation must identify the derivative hedging 
instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted 
transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the 
effectiveness of the derivative is assessed 
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess 
effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such 
as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as 
dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair 
value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or 
cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative 
comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any 
changes in those terms. The extent to which a 
derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, 
highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value 
or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed 
and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined 
that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the 
designated exposure, hedge accounting is 
discontinued. 
There are three types of hedge accounting 
designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and 
net investment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair 
value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term 
debt, AFS securities and certain commodities 
inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the 
changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the 
value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are 
recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded 
from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in 
OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the 
derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then 
the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be 
reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, 
for interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized 
to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts 
affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the 
classification of the hedged item – primarily net 
interest income and principal transactions revenue. 
The Firm employs the portfolio layer method to 
manage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate 
assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis 
adjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and 
are only allocated to individual assets under certain 
circumstances. These include instances where the 
portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer 
amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-designation.
JPMorganChase uses cash flow hedges primarily to 
hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash 
flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and 
foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. 
For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair 
value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and 
recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects 
earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are 
recognized consistent with the classification of the 
hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net 
interest income and compensation expense. If the 
hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in 
value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized 
in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged 
affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are 
discontinued because a forecasted transaction is 
expected to not occur according to the original hedge 
forecast, any related derivative values recorded in 
AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. 
JPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to 
protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in 
certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose 
functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For 
qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair 
value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign 
exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation 
adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment 
of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party 
notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an 
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives 
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in 
the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise 
from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, 
the notional amount is not exchanged; it is simply a 
reference amount used to calculate payments.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, gross and net derivative receivables and payables 
by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the 
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those 
derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables. 
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables 
and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts 
mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net 
presentation: 
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are 
shown separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables, up to the fair value 
exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the 
definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty 
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and 
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion 
has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the 
tables.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose 
JPMorganChase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations 
under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover 
the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorganChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally 
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk 
inherent in derivative receivables.
While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as 
the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair 
value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its 
subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, 
generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The 
following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared 
derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings 
downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 
2024 and 2023.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2024 and 
2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that 
may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be 
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single 
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another 
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional 
initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity 
impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies 
referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the 
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in 
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing 
transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and 
a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative 
was outstanding was not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term 
debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. 
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. 
Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. 
Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact 
of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
(net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such 
as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact 
earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the 
current period. 
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly 
cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.2 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to which the 
Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus 
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to 
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency 
hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for 
AFS securities was $28.7 billion and $19.3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for long-term 
debt was $518 million and zero, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized 
cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $72.8 billion and $83.9 billion, of which $41.2 billion and $68.0 billion was designated 
as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, 
which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of basis 
adjustments was $(1.7) billion and $(165) million, which is comprised of $(1.2) billion and $73 million for active hedging relationships, and 
$(566) million and $(238) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest 
income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will 
increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from 
qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement 
classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.
The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 
2022.
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.6) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI 
at December 31, 2024, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have 
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized 
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash 
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing 
activities.

meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to 
manage certain risks associated with net open risk 
positions from its market-making activities, including 
the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative 
receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge 
accounting or specified risk management categories 
above are included in this category. Gains and losses 
on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal 
transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information 
on principal transactions revenue. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
221
Credit derivatives 
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose 
value is derived from the credit risk associated with 
the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) 
and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) 
to transfer that risk to another party (the protection 
seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection 
purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection 
seller, as the protection seller is required to make 
payments under the contract when the reference 
entity experiences a credit event, such as a 
bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a 
restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a 
premium for providing protection but has the risk that 
the underlying instrument referenced in the contract 
will be subject to a credit event. 
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in 
the credit derivatives market and uses these 
derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its 
capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively 
manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by 
purchasing and selling credit protection, 
predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet 
the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the 
Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk 
associated with lending exposures (loans and 
unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and 
consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty 
exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage 
the credit risk arising from certain financial 
instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. 
Following is a summary of various types of credit 
derivatives. 
Credit default swaps 
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a 
single reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based 
index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells 
protection on both single- name and index-reference 
obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS 
contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative 
contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the 
default risk of a single reference entity, while index 
CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk 
associated with the broader credit markets or credit 
market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market 
indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS 
across many reference entities. New series of CDS 
indices are periodically established with a new 
underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect 
changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference 
entities in the index experiences a credit event, then 
the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the 
index. CDS can also be referenced against specific 
portfolios of reference names or against customized 
exposure levels: for example, to provide protection 
against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a 
$10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are 
commonly known as tranche CDS. 
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS 
contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under 
the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS 
contract has recourse to the reference entity. The 
protection purchaser has recourse to the protection 
seller for the difference between the face value of the 
CDS contract and the fair value of the reference 
obligation at settlement of the credit derivative 
contract, also known as the recovery value. The 
protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt 
instrument of the underlying reference entity in order 
to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when 
a credit event occurs. 
Credit-related notes 
A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a 
credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-
related note purchases from the note investor credit 
protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the 
contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of 
the note at the inception of the transaction, and in 
return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the 
investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced 
entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value 
of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or 
one of the entities that makes up a reference index) 
experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event 
occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par 
value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the 
investor the difference between the par value of the 
note and the fair value of the defaulted reference 
obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to 
the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting 
reference entity.
The following tables present a summary of the notional 
amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes 
the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 
and 2023. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of 
protection would typically pay out a percentage of the 
full notional amount of net protection sold, as the 
amount actually required to be paid on the contracts 
takes into account the recovery value of the reference 
obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages 
the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by 
purchasing protection with identical or similar 
underlying reference entities. Other purchased 
protection referenced in the following tables includes 
credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, 
reference positions (including indices, portfolio 
coverage and other reference points) as well as 
protection purchased by CIB through credit-related 
notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit 
protection against certain loans in the retained lending 
portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and 
credit-related notes. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
222
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such 
derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit 
event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of 
which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain 
contracts with customers in investment banking fees, 
deposit-related fees, asset management fees, 
commissions and other fees, and components of card 
income. The related contracts are often terminable on 
demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to 
deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed 
term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the 
future. Revenue associated with these remaining 
performance obligations typically depends on the 
occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, 
and is not recognized until the outcome of those 
events or values are known.
Investment banking fees 
This revenue category includes debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the 
Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and 
private placement of various types of debt and equity 
instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on 
the issuance price and quantity of the underlying 
instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically 
upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm 
also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. 
Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included 
within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue 
after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield 
criteria. 
The Firm also provides advisory services by assisting 
its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, 
restructuring and other complex transactions. 
Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically 
upon execution of the client’s transaction.

Principal transactions 
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many 
factors, including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between 
the price at which a market participant is willing and 
able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at 
which another market participant is willing and able 
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, 
including those accounted for under the fair value 
option, primarily used in client-driven market-
making activities. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of 
transactions, or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial 
instruments that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized 
and unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge 
accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges 
of commodity and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management 
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income 
statement classification of gains and losses from 
derivatives activities. 
In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts 
in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and 
ETD that reference a wide range of underlying 
commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the 
Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base 
metals, natural gas, and may hold other commodities 
inventories under financing and other arrangements 
with clients. 
The following table presents all realized and unrealized 
gains and losses recorded in principal transactions 
revenue. This table excludes interest income and 
interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, 
which are an integral part of the overall performance of 
the Firm’s client-driven market-making activities in 
CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and

Lending- and deposit-related fees 
Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan 
commitments, standby letters of credit, financial 
guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. 
Deposit-related fees include fees earned from 
performing cash management activities, and providing 
overdraft and other deposit account services. Deposit-
related fees also include the impact of credits earned 
by clients that reduce such fees. Lending- and deposit-
related fees are recognized over the period in which 
the related service is provided. Refer to Note 28 for

2023 as the commitments were generally short term. Refer to 
Note 34 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, 
CIB and AWM. 
Asset management fees
Investment management fees include fees associated 
with  assets the Firm manages on behalf of its clients, 
including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and 
owners of separately managed investment accounts. 
Management fees are typically based on the value of 
assets under management and are collected and 
recognized at the end of each period over which the 
management services are provided and the value of 
the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives 
performance-based management fees, which are 
earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or 
other performance targets and are accrued and 
recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, 
typically at the end of the related billing period.
All other asset management fees include commissions 
earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to 
clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time 
the service is rendered or, in the case of certain 
distribution fees, based on the underlying fund’s asset 
value or investor redemption activity.

management fees.

This revenue category includes commissions and fees 
from brokerage and custody services, and other 
products.
Brokerage commissions represents commissions 
earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating 
its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other 
financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are 
collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence 
of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs 
paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net 
against commission revenue.
Administration fees predominantly include fees for 
custody, funds services, securities lending and 
securities clearance. These fees are recorded as 
revenue over the period in which the related service is 
provided.

Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending 
production and net mortgage servicing revenue. 
Production revenue includes fees and income 
recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated 
with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk 
management activities associated with the mortgage 
pipeline and warehouse loans. Production revenue 
also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of 
cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-
for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured 
by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair 
value of financial instruments measured under the fair 
value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes 
operating revenue earned from servicing third-party 
mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in 
which the service is provided; changes in the fair value 
of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities 
associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on 
securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net 
mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and 
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value 
adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by 
U.S. government agencies. 
Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk 
management activities and MSRs. 
Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded 
in interest income. 
Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other 
income from credit and debit card transactions; and 
fees earned from processing card transactions for 
merchants, both of which are recognized when 
purchases are made by a cardholder and presented 
net of certain transaction-related costs. Card income 
also includes account origination costs and annual 
fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-
line basis over a 12-month period.
Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the 
ability to earn points based on account activity, which 
the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and 
non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to 
these proprietary rewards programs varies based on 
multiple factors including the terms and conditions of 
the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder 
reward redemption rates and cardholder reward 
selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its 
obligations under its rewards programs and reports 
the current-period cost as a reduction of card income. 
Credit card revenue sharing agreements 
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous 
co-brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights 
to issue co-branded credit card products and market 
them to the customers of such partners. These 
partners endorse the co-brand credit card programs 
and provide their customer or member lists to the 
Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing 
activities and provide rewards redeemable under their 
own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co-
brand credit cardholders based on account activity. 
The terms of these agreements generally range from 
five to ten years.
The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand 
credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ 
marketing activities and loyalty program rewards 
provided to credit cardholders, new account 
originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners 
based on marketing efforts undertaken by the 
partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and 
reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner 
loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of 
card income when incurred. Payments to partners 
based on new credit card account originations are 
accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are 
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income 
on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. 
Payments to partners based on sales volumes are 
reported as a reduction of card income when the 
related interchange income is earned.

Note 7 – Interest income and interest expense
Interest income and interest expense are recorded in 
the Consolidated statements of income and classified 
based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability.
Interest income and interest expense includes the 
current-period interest accruals for financial 
instruments measured at fair value, except for 
derivatives and certain financial instruments 
containing embedded derivatives; for those 
instruments, all changes in fair value including any 
interest elements, are primarily reported in principal 
transactions revenue. For financial instruments that 
are not measured at fair value, the related interest is 
included within interest income or interest expense, as 
applicable. Interest income and interest expense also 
includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge 
accounting where applicable.
Interest income on loans and securities include the 
amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and 
discounts, as well as net deferred fees and costs on 
loans. These amounts are deferred in loans and 
investment securities, respectively, and recognized on 
a level-yield basis.
Refer to Notes 5, 10, 11, 12, and 20 for further 
information on accounting for interest income and 
interest expense related to hedge accounting, 
investment securities, securities financing activities 
(i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or 
repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and 
securities loaned), loans and long-term debt, 
respectively.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement 
employee benefit plans 
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and 
OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the 
U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the 
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new 
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan 
in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. 
employees, was closed to new participants and frozen 
for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and 
January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 
2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to 
participants’ accounts based on their accumulated 
balances.
The Firm maintains funded and unfunded 
postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and 
life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees 
as well as their dependents covered under these 
programs. None of these plans have a material impact 
on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution 
plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar 
arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most 
significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) 
Savings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers 
substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can 
contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or 
Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual 
matching and pay credit contributions to the 401(k) 
Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.  
The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts 
recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB 
plans.

The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was 
5.49% and 5.16%, respectively.
Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded 
in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are 
recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over 
subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, 
the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the 
projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan 
assets. Amortization is generally over the average 
expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given 
the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended 
December 31, 2024, the net loss was attributable to 
lower than expected returns on plan assets, partially 
offset by projected benefit obligation net gains 
primarily related to changes in the discount rate. For the 
year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was 
attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value 
of plan assets, partially offset by changes in the 
discount rate and interest crediting rate.
The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the 
Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the

Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a 
blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the 
projected long-term returns for the various asset 
classes, taking into consideration local market 
conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. 
Returns on asset classes are developed using a 
forward-looking approach and are not strictly based 
on historical returns, with consideration given to 
current market conditions and the portfolio mix of 
each plan. 
The discount rates used in determining the benefit 
obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s 
actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined benefit 
pension plan using a rate that was selected by 
reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with 
maturity dates and coupons that closely match the 
plan’s projected annual cash flows. 
Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans 
are held in various trusts and are invested in well-
diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income 
securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative 
investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset 
allocations and asset managers, as well as other 
factors that could impact the portfolios, which are 
rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of December 
31, 2024, the approved asset allocation ranges by 
asset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit plan 
are 41-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 
0-1% real estate, and 0-8% alternatives.
Assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and 
OPEB plans do not include securities issued by 
JPMorganChase or its affiliates, except through 
indirect exposures through investments in exchange 
traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment 
funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit 
pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are 
sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorganChase 
in the amount of $1.8 billion as of both December 31, 
2024 and 2023. 
Fair value measurement of the plans’ assets and liabilities

Changes in level 3 fair value measurements using 
significant unobservable inputs
Investments classified in level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy increased in 2024 to $4.0 billion, due to  
$536 million of transfers in and $415 million in 
unrealized gains, partially offset by $123 million in 
settlements. The net increase in 2023 was due to 
$400 million in unrealized gains and $173 million of 
transfers in, partially offset by $59 million in 
settlements.

Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives
Employee share-based awards
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, JPMorganChase granted 
long-term share-based awards to certain employees 
under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 
18, 2021, and subsequently amended effective May 21, 
2024. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 
2024, 81 million shares of common stock were 
available for issuance through May 2028. The LTIP is 
the only active plan under which the Firm is currently 
granting share-based incentive awards. In the 
following discussion, the LTIP constitutes the Firm’s 
share-based incentive plans. 
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon 
their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and 
vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after 
three years and are converted into shares of common 
stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically 
include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow 
employees to continue to vest upon voluntary 
termination based on age and/or service-related 
requirements, subject to post-employment and other 
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture 
until vested and contain clawback provisions that may 
result in cancellation under certain specified 
circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the 
recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any 
dividends paid on the underlying common stock 
during the period the RSUs are outstanding. 
Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted 
annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of 
Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating 
Committee under the variable compensation program. 
PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of 
specified performance criteria over a three-year 
period. The number of awards that vest can range from 
zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, 
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are 
reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs 
and the related dividend equivalent share units are 
converted into shares of common stock after vesting.
Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units 
have vested, the shares of common stock that are 
delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be 
retained for an additional holding period, for a total 
combined vesting and holding period of approximately 
five to eight years from the grant date depending on 
regulations in certain countries. 
Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)  
were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair 
value of JPMorganChase’s common stock on the grant 
date. SARs expire ten years after the grant date. There 
were no grants of SARs in 2024, 2023 or 2022. 
The Firm separately recognizes compensation 
expense for each tranche of each award, net of 
estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award 
with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche 
granted, compensation expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting 
date of the respective tranche, provided that the 
employees will not become full-career eligible during 
the vesting period. For awards with full-career 
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future 
substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the 
estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to 
employees as of the grant date without giving 
consideration to the impact of post-employment 
restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees 
who will become full-career eligible during the vesting 
period, compensation expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier 
of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the 
vesting date of the respective tranche. 
The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of 
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue 
either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. 
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its 
employee share-based awards by issuing treasury 
shares. 
Refer to Note 23 for further information on the 
classification of share-based awards for purposes of 
calculating earnings per share.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
233
RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity 
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied 
by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation 
model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following 
table summarizes JPMorganChase’s RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity for 2024.

Note 10 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are 
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as 
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly 
all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by 
Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability 
management activities.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and 
losses, after any applicable hedge accounting 
adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are 
reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is 
used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS 
securities, which are included in investment securities 
gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of 
income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent 
and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at 
amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on 
the Consolidated balance sheets.
For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts 
or premiums are generally amortized into interest 
income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of 
the security. However, premiums on certain callable 
debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.

accrued interest receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm 
did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Notes to consolidated financial statements
236
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
At December 31, 2024, the investment securities 
portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average 
credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings 
where available, and where not available, based 
primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are 
used to identify the credit quality of securities and 
differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s 
internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative 
characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in 
the economic environment) defined by S&P and 
Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics 
(e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default 
(“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical 
experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are 
assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and 
ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and 
adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment 
for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to 
fulfill its obligations.
AFS securities impairment 
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE 
and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $5.3 billion and $4.6 billion, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than 
changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value 
is less than the amortized cost. 
The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if 
the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it 
is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to 
sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized 
cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is 
recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in 
the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to 
the full difference between the amortized cost (net of 
allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the 
security. 
For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the 
intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated 
to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined 
that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an 
allowance for credit losses through the provision for 
credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any 
impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the 
intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is 
recorded in OCI. 
Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include 
adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, 
geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or 
underlying collateral of a security; and payment 
structure of the security. 
When assessing securities issued in a securitization 
for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows 
considering relevant market and economic data, 
underlying loan-level data, and structural features of 
the securitization, such as subordination, excess 
spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit 
enhancement, and compares the losses projected for 
the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the 
level of credit enhancement in the securitization 
structure to determine whether these features are 
sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit 
loss exists. 
For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated 
below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be 
contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a 
way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of 
its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates 
impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse 
change in expected cash flows. 
HTM securities – credit risk
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities 
represents expected credit losses over the remaining 
expected life of the securities.
The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of 
U.S. states and municipalities and commercial 
mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying 
statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) 
to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are 
derived using a weighted average of five internally 
developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, 
followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to 
revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further 
information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic 
forecast. 
The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized 
loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed 
securities is calculated as the difference between the 
amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows 
expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s 
effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are 
developed based on expectations of underlying 
collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter 
macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-
line interpolation, as well as considering the structural 
features of the security. 
The application of different inputs and assumptions 
into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is 
subject to significant management judgment, and 
emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or 
considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect 
the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM 
securities. 
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities 
is the risk rating assigned to each security. At both 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, all HTM securities were 
rated investment grade and were current and 
accruing, with approximately 99% rated at least AA+ 
(based upon external ratings where available, and 
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk 
ratings).
Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities was $152 million, $128 million and 
$96 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, which included a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to retained earnings related to the transfer 
of HTM securities to AFS for the year ended 
December 31, 2023.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of 
each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of 
related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield 
excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected 
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call 
date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $49 million and the 
portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $(1.2) billion at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also 
excludes the allowance for credit losses of $103 million at December 31, 2024.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual 
maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential 
MBS, six years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage 
obligations.

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorganChase enters into resale, repurchase, 
securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements 
(collectively, “securities financing agreements”) 
primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, 
acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate 
customers’ financing needs, settle other securities 
obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash.  
Securities financing agreements are treated as 
collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable 
accounting guidance, securities financing agreements 
with the same counterparty are reported on a net 
basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the 
offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and 
paid in connection with securities financing 
agreements are recorded over the life of the 
agreement in interest income and interest expense on 
the Consolidated statements of income. 
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain 
securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for 
further information regarding the fair value option. The 
securities financing agreements for which the fair 
value option has been elected are reported within 
securities purchased under resale agreements, 
securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements, and securities borrowed on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for 
agreements carried at fair value, current-period 
interest accruals are recorded within interest income 
and interest expense, with changes in fair value 
reported in principal transactions revenue. However, 
for financial instruments containing embedded 
derivatives that would be separately accounted for in 
accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid 
instruments, all changes in fair value, including any 
interest elements, are reported in principal 
transactions revenue. 
Securities financing agreements not elected under the 
fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a 
result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices 
described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance 
for credit losses with respect to resale and securities 
borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023.
Credit risk mitigation practices
Securities financing agreements expose the Firm 
primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these 
risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying 
securities (predominantly high-quality securities 
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. 
GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has 
received from or provided to its counterparties 
compared to the value of cash proceeds and 
exchanged collateral, and either requests additional 
collateral or returns securities or collateral when 
appropriate. Margin levels are initially established 
based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying 
securities, and the permissible collateral, and are 
monitored on an ongoing basis. 
In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the 
Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the 
value of the securities received is less than initial cash 
principal advanced and any collateral amounts 
exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned 
agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent 
that the value of underlying securities advanced 
exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, 
and any collateral amounts exchanged. 
Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master 
netting agreements and other similar arrangements 
with its counterparties, which provide for the right to 
liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral 
amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty 
default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, 
where possible, of the securities underlying resale and 
securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for 
further information regarding assets pledged and 
collateral received in securities financing agreements.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
The table below summarizes the gross and net 
amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, 
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. When the Firm has 
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a 
master netting agreement with a counterparty and 
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP 
are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance 
sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities 
financing agreements with the same counterparty. In 
addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash 
collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic 
exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is 
not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet 
presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the 
counterparty master netting agreement, such 
collateral, along with securities financing balances that 
do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under 
U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as 
“Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance 
sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. 
Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or 
obtained, the securities financing balances are 
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In 
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and 
receives securities that can be pledged or sold as 
collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received 
at fair value within other assets and the obligation to 
return those securities within accounts payable and 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held $805 million and $505 million, respectively, of financial assets for 
which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred 
assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded primarily in short-
term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s 
strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans 
based on the following categories:
• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment 
(i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value
The following provides a detailed accounting 
discussion of the Firm’s loans by category:
Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, 
including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, 
reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the 
following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, 
premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; 
and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include 
billed finance charges and fees.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-
investment is accrued and recognized as interest 
income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase 
price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred 
loan fees or costs, are recognized in interest income 
over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of 
yield.
The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including 
accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in 
accrued interest and accounts receivables on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, 
accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the 
loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in 
the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the 
allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on 
credit card loans are recognized in the provision for 
credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by 
reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm 
generally does not recognize an allowance for credit 
losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with 
its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past 
due by reversing interest income. 
Nonaccrual loans 
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of 
interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual 
status and considered nonperforming when full 
payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal 
and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days 
or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the 
process of collection. A loan is determined to be past 
due when the minimum payment is not received from 
the borrower by the contractually specified due date or 
for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), 
when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 
days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are 
typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all 
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against 
interest income. In addition, the amortization of 
deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on 
nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest 
payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the 
recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; 
however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate 
collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest 
cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value 
of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer 
loans, application of this policy typically results in the 
Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual 
consumer loans on a cash basis.
A loan may be returned to accrual status when 
repayment is reasonably assured and there has been 
demonstrated performance under the terms of the 
loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured 
loan. 
As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans 
are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual 
status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit 
card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged 
off or paid in full. 
Allowance for loan losses 
The allowance for loan losses represents the 
estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-
investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra 
asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net 
carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan 
losses resulting from lending-related activity, 
macroeconomic variables, changes in credit and other 
inputs are recorded in the provision for credit losses 
on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. 
Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s 
accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. 
Charge-offs 
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged 
down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net 
realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair 
value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the 
allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified 
stages of delinquency in accordance with standards 
established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, 
unmodified credit card loans and scored business 
banking loans are generally charged off no later than 
180 days past due. Scored auto and closed-end 
consumer loans, including modified credit card 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
243
accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged 
off no later than 120 days past due. 
Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged 
down to their net realizable value earlier than the 
FFIEC charge-off standards in the following 
circumstances: 
• Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty that are determined to be collateral-
dependent. 
• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event 
that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain 
are subject to accelerated charge-off standards 
(e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are 
charged off or charged down within 60 days of 
receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). 
• Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. 
Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm 
typically does not recognize charge-offs on the 
government-guaranteed portion of loans. 
Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly 
certain that a loss has been realized. The 
determination of whether to recognize a charge-off 
includes many factors, including the prioritization of 
the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the 
workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the 
borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. 
When a loan is charged down to the lower of its 
amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of 
the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair 
value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral 
(e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the 
collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair 
value is based on quoted market prices or broker 
quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, 
the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated 
using a discounted cash flow model. 
For residential real estate loans, collateral values are 
based upon external valuation sources. When it 
becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or 
unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price 
opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation 
model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation 
(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least 
every 12 months, or more frequently depending on 
various market factors. As soon as practicable after 
the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt 
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the 
Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an 
inspection that includes the interior of the home 
(“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior 
appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s 
experience with actual liquidation values as compared 
with the estimated values provided by exterior 
opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-
specific factors. 
For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are 
generally based on appraisals from internal and 
external valuation sources. Collateral values are 
typically updated every six to twelve months, either by 
obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal 
analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The 
Firm also considers both borrower- and market-
specific factors, which may result in obtaining 
appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more 
frequent intervals.
Loans held-for-sale 
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost 
or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in 
noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the 
valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For 
wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an 
individual loan basis. 
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. 
Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price 
discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan 
account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees 
or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment 
to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in 
the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair 
value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized 
at the time of sale. 
Because these loans are recognized at the lower of 
cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses 
and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. 
However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s 
nonaccrual policies. 
Loans at fair value 
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected 
are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value 
recorded in noninterest revenue. 
Interest income on these loans is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. 
Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest 
revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront 
in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are 
recognized in the associated expense category as 
incurred. 
Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off 
policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at 
fair value are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. 
Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s 
elections of fair value accounting under the fair value 
option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further 
information on loans carried at fair value and classified 
as trading assets.

Loan classification changes 
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that 
management decides to sell are transferred to the 
held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value 
on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are 
charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-
credit related losses such as those due to changes in 
interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are 
recognized in noninterest revenue. 
In the event that management decides to retain a loan 
in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to 
the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on 
the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently 
assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s 
allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further 
discussion of the methodologies used in establishing 
the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. 
Loan modifications 
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction 
with its loss mitigation activities. Through the 
modification, JPMorganChase grants one or more 
concessions to a borrower who is experiencing 
financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s 
economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession 
of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments 
received by the Firm from the borrower. The 
concessions granted vary by program and by 
borrower-specific characteristics, and may include 
interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-
insignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. 
Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs 
are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in 
many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual 
status prior to modification. These loans may be 
returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is 
resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the 
borrower has performed under the modified terms for 
a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) 
the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the 
modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for 
example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of 
future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other 
current market considerations. In certain limited and 
well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current 
at the modification date, such loans are not placed on 
nonaccrual status at the time of modification. 
The allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs 
is measured using the Firm’s established allowance 
methodology, which considers the expected default 
rates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for 
further discussion. 
Foreclosed property 
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through 
loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. 
Property acquired may include real property (e.g., 
residential real estate, land, and buildings) and other 
commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, 
aircraft, railcars, and ships). 
The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon 
receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking 
legal title or physical possession). For loans 
collateralized by real property, the Firm generally 
recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or 
upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are 
reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance 
sheets and initially recognized at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of 
the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if 
necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. 
Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/
credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, 
such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are 
charged to other expense.

Loan portfolio 
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to 
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each 
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk 
characteristics of each loan class. 
Consumer, excluding 
credit card

lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue were 
$154 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, of which $113 million were related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on 
sales of loans and lending-related commitments were $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which 
$62 million were related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments were $(186) 
million for the year ended December 31, 2022, of which $(48) million were related to loans. In addition, the sale of 
loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit 
losses.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking 
loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer 
credit market. These loans include home equity loans 
secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an 
interest-only payment period, and certain payment-
option loans that may result in negative amortization.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality 
indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 
30 days past due provide an early warning of 
borrowers who may be experiencing financial 
difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to 
repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it 
becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to 
be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential 
real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater 
than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans 
that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar 
liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency 
rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer 
loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: 
• For residential real estate loans, the current 
estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in 
the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the 
potential loss severity in the event of default. 
Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can 
provide insight into a borrower’s continued 
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-
LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans 
where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The 
geographic distribution of the loan collateral also 
provides insight as to the credit quality of the 
portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, 
home price changes and specific events such as 
natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The 
borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a 
secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, 
as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s 
credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower 
with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered 
to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a 
higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with 
a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater 
risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both 
a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.
• For scored auto and business banking loans, 
geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit 
performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential 
real estate loans, geographic distribution provides 
insights into the portfolio performance based on 
regional economic activity and events.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 
2024 and 2023.
(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 
2024 and 2023. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 38% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The 
lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been 
converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is 
primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the 
minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The 
Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not 
reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2024, 
approximately 8% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.
(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value 
of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $160 million and $180 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively.
(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at 
a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to 
the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans 
considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(f)
Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO 
band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.
(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of residential 
real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification 
programs as well as government programs, including 
U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various 
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate 
reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant 
payment deferral and principal forgiveness that would 
otherwise have been required under the terms of the 
original agreement, are considered FDMs. 
In addition, the Firm offers trial modifications of 
residential real estate loans, which generally include a 
three-month trial payment period during which the 
borrower makes monthly payments under the 
proposed modified loan terms. Loans in a trial 
payment period continue to age and accrue interest in 
accordance with the original contractual terms. At the 
completion of a trial period, the loan modification is 
considered permanent.
Financial effects of FDMs
For the year ended December 31, 2024, retained 
residential real estate FDMs were $206 million. The 
financial effects of the FDMs, which were 
predominantly in the form of term extensions and 
interest rate reductions, included extending the 
weighted-average life of the loans by 15 years, and 
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest 
rate from 7.53% to 5.44% for the year ended 
December 31, 2024. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, retained 
residential real estate FDMs were $136 million. The 
financial effects of the FDMs, which were 
predominantly in the form of term extensions and 
interest rate reductions, included extending the 
weighted-average life of the loans by 20 years, and 
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest 
rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no 
additional commitments to lend to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been 
modified as FDMs.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
loans subject to a trial modification, where the terms of 
the loans have not been permanently modified, and 
Chapter 7 loans were not material.

Defaults of FDMs
Retained residential real estate FDMs that defaulted

were reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to 
the default were $93 million. Retained residential real 
estate FDMs that defaulted during the year ended 
December 31, 2023 and that were reported as FDMs 
on or after January 1, 2023, the date that the Firm 
adopted the changes to the TDR accounting guidance 
were not material. Refer to Note 1 for further 
information.

Nature and extent of TDRs
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, 
modifications of residential real estate loans where the 
Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were 
experiencing financial difficulty were generally 
accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that were not 
considered concessions were not TDRs. For the year 
ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $362 
million, and there were no additional commitments to 
lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans 
were modified in TDRs. 
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well 
as government programs, including U.S. GSE 
programs, generally provide various concessions to 
financially troubled borrowers including, but not 
limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment 
extensions and delays of principal and/or interest 
payments that would otherwise have been required 
under the terms of the original agreement. 
The following table provides information about how 
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs 
during the period presented. This table excludes loans 
with short-term or other insignificant modifications 
that are not considered concessions.

Active and suspended foreclosure 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm had retained 
residential real estate loans, excluding those insured 
by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of 
$576 million and $566 million, respectively, that were 
not included in REO, but were in the process of active 
or suspended foreclosure.

accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans 
that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged 
down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card 
loans originated and purchased by the Firm. 
Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality 
indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early 
warning that borrowers may be experiencing 
difficulties (30 days past due); information on those 
borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer 
period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In 
addition to delinquency rates, the geographic 
distribution of the loans provides insight as to the 
credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional 
economy.
While the borrower’s credit score is another general 
indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view 
credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality 
because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a 
lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores 
provides a general indicator of credit quality trends 
within the portfolio; however, the score does not 
capture all factors that would be predictive of future 
credit performance. Refreshed FICO score 
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a 
statistically significant random sample of the credit 
card portfolio is indicated in other credit quality 
indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry 
benchmark for credit scores.
The Firm generally originates new credit card 
accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, 
certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over 
time, depending on the performance of the cardholder 
and changes in the credit score calculation. 
The following tables provide information on delinquency and gross charge-offs.

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These 
modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 
months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not 
make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age 
and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not 
reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Defaults of FDMs
Retained credit card FDMs that defaulted during the 
year ended December 31, 2024 and that were reported 
as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were 
not material. Retained credit card FDMs that defaulted 
during the year ended December 31, 2023 and that 
were reported as FDMs on or after January 1, 2023, the 
date that the Firm adopted the changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance were not material. Refer to Note 1 
for further information.
For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment 
default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower 
misses two consecutive contractual payments. 
Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the 
modification program and continue to be charged off 
in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off 
policy.
Financial effects of TDRs and defaults 
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, 
modifications of credit card loans where the Firm 
granted concessions to borrowers who were 
experiencing financial difficulty were generally 
accounted for and reported as TDRs. The Firm granted 
concessions for most of the credit card loans under 
long-term programs. These concessions involved 
placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed 
payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically 
included reducing the interest rate on the credit card 
account. Substantially all modifications under the 
Firm’s long-term programs were considered to be 
TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that were not considered concessions 
were not reported as TDRs.
The following table provides information about the 
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit 
card loans modified in TDRs and defaults for the 
periods presented. For the period disclosed, new 
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit 
card loans.

default occurred within one year of the modification. The 
amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the 
end of the quarter in which they defaulted.
For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment 
default was deemed to have occurred when the 
borrower missed two consecutive contractual 
payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans 
remained in the modification program and continued 
to be charged of in accordance with the Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of 
clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional 
clients to small businesses and high-net-worth 
individuals.
The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans 
is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk 
ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans 
and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings 
on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the 
likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the 
estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon 
the default of the borrower and takes into 
consideration collateral and structural support for 
each credit facility. 
Management considers several factors to determine 
an appropriate internal risk rating, including the 
obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the 
level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources 
for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, 
management strength, and the industry and 
geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s 
internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative 
characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in 
the economic environment) defined by S&P and 
Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics 
(e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal 
historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm 
generally considers internal ratings with qualitative 
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as 
investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD 
and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.  
Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as 
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion 
is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual 
loans, representing management’s assessment of the 
collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans 
have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s 
definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking 
regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which 
consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.   
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing 
basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as 
necessary for updated information affecting the 
obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.
As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the 
industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. 
As part of the overall credit risk management 
framework, the Firm focuses on the management and 
diversification of its industry and client exposures, with 
particular attention paid to industries with an actual or 
potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further 
detail on industry concentrations.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, additional unfunded commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty were $1.8 billion at each period in Commercial and industrial, and $69 million and $4 million, 
respectively, in Other loan class. Additional commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs in Secured by real estate were not material at each period.
Nature and extent of TDRs
Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided 
various concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm 
elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $801 million. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 
2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to 
the Firm. 
As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves 
a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over 
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The 
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), 
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, 
which is presented on the Consolidated balance 
sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities, which is reflected in investment securities 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The income statement effect of all changes in the 
allowance for credit losses is recognized in the 
provision for credit losses. 
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is complex and requires significant 
judgment by management about the effect of matters 
that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the 
allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the 
CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent 
evaluations of credit exposures, considering the 
macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors 
then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the 
allowance for credit losses in future periods. 
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for 
loan losses and its allowance for lending-related 
commitments are described in the following 
paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the 
policies used to determine the allowance for credit 
losses on investment securities. 
Methodology for allowances for loan losses and 
lending-related commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for 
lending-related commitments represents expected 
credit losses over the remaining expected life of 
retained loans and lending-related commitments that 
are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not 
record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally 
cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit 
cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on 
credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance 
for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an 
allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to 
its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 
days past due by reversing interest income. 
The expected life of each instrument is determined by 
considering its contractual term, expected 
prepayments, cancellation features, and certain 
extension and call options. The expected life of funded 
credit card loans is generally estimated by considering 
expected future payments on the credit card account, 
and determining how much of those amounts should be 
allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as 
of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. 
This allocation is made using an approach that 
incorporates the payment application requirements of 
the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and 
Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the 
highest interest rate balances first. 
The estimate of expected credit losses includes 
expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries 
result in a negative allowance. 
Collective and Individual Assessments
When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm 
assesses whether exposures share similar risk 
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the 
Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, 
considering the risk associated with a particular pool 
and the probability that the exposures within the pool 
will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk 
characteristics is subject to significant management 
judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another 
or considering additional characteristics could affect 
the allowance. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer 
portfolio include product type, delinquency status, 
current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for 
collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.  
• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale 
portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, 
tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, 
industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility 
purpose, and payment terms. 
The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk 
characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a 
result are collectively assessed for impairment 
(“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based 
component covers consumer loans, performing risk-
rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. 
If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with 
other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected 
credit losses on an individual basis, considering 
expected repayment and conditions impacting that 
individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The 
asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent 
loans and risk-rated loans that have been placed on 
nonaccrual status. 
Portfolio-based component
The portfolio-based component begins with a 
quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of 
the borrower changing delinquency status or moving 
from one risk rating to another. The quantitative 
calculation covers expected credit losses over an 
instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying 
credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at 
default. The credit loss factors incorporate the 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
266
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in 
the event of default. They are derived using a weighted 
average of five internally developed macroeconomic 
scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, 
followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to 
revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five 
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative 
adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme 
upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central 
forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration 
the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal 
perspectives from subject matter experts across the 
Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed 
process that incorporates feedback from senior 
management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk 
Management.
The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that 
are not yet reflected in the calculation. These 
adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the 
historical loss experience, including during stressed 
periods, for each major product or model. Management 
applies judgment in making this adjustment, including 
taking into account uncertainties associated with the 
economic and political conditions, quality of 
underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit 
concentrations or deterioration within an industry, 
product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal 
and external factors affecting the credit quality of the 
portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships 
between these factors create further uncertainties.
The application of different inputs into the quantitative 
calculation, and the assumptions used by management 
to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to 
significant management judgment, and emphasizing 
one input or assumption over another, or considering 
other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate 
of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for 
lending-related commitments.
Asset-specific component 
To determine the asset-specific component of the 
allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those 
loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are 
generally evaluated individually.
For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of 
collateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is 
used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in 
value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the 
fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative 
allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of 
prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the 
fair value of the collateral).
For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally 
measures the asset-specific allowance as the 
difference between the amortized cost of the loan and 
the present value of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, discounted at the loan’s effective interest 
rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally 
recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan 
losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance 
for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the 
effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash 
flows including changes in interest rates, principal 
forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as  
management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to 
repay under the modified terms. 
Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows 
is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely 
upon estimates such as loss severities, asset 
valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or 
principal payments (including any expected 
prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of 
current and expected market conditions. These 
estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the 
duration of current overall economic conditions, 
industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the 
expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well 
as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All 
of these estimates and assumptions require significant 
management judgment and certain assumptions are 
highly subjective. 
Other financial assets
In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm 
holds other financial assets that are measured at 
amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, 
including credit exposures arising from lending 
activities subject to collateral maintenance 
requirements. Management estimates the allowance 
for other financial assets using various techniques 
considering historical losses and current economic 
conditions. 
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to 
collateral maintenance requirements is generally 
mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of 
the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the 
Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to 
provide additional margin when the fair value of the 
collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, 
these exposures generally do not require an allowance 
for credit losses. However, management may also 
consider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing 
ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin 
requirements, or whether collateral is significantly 
concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with 
similar risk characteristics. If in management’s 
judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these 
exposures is required, the Firm estimates expected 
credit losses based on the value of the collateral and 
probability of borrower default.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 
2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 
billion from December 31, 2023.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
included:
• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting: 
– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, 
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting 
higher revolving balances, including the seasoning 
of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by 
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and 
• a net reduction of $30 million in wholesale, 
reflecting: 
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by 
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to 
include additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and 
downside risks related to the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic environment.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated 
using a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors 
than the central case assumptions provided in the 
table below, resulting in:
• a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking 
at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and
• a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% 
lower than the central case at the end of the second 
quarter of 2026.
The following table presents the Firm’s central case 
assumptions for the periods presented:

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related 
estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit 
losses in future periods.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm 
considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorganChase is the primary beneficiary of the 
structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorganChase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments 
with the JPMorganChase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorganChase–administered asset-backed commercial paper 
conduit.

The Firm’s other business segments and Corporate are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-
sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows: 
• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset 
manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment 
objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, 
considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are 
generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of 
investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties 
which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have 
the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. 
Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs 
sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third 
parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card Services business may securitize 
originated credit card loans, primarily through the 
Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s 
continuing involvement in credit card securitizations 
includes servicing the receivables, retaining an 
undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining 
certain senior and subordinated securities and 
maintaining escrow accounts. 
The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its 
sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be 
the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts 
based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of 
these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and 
other duties, including making decisions as to the 
receivables that are transferred into those trusts and 
as to any related modifications and workouts. 
Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other 
continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated 
above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives 
the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from 
these VIEs that could potentially be significant. 
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and 
other assets of the securitization trusts are available 
only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by 
the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay 
the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s 
creditors. 
The agreements with the credit card securitization 
trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum 
undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 
5%). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held 
undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card 
securitization trusts of $6.6 billion and $4.9 billion, 
respectively. The Firm maintained an average 
undivided interest in principal receivables owned by 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
271
those trusts of approximately 45% and 65% for the 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior 
securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated 
securities in certain of its credit card securitization 
trusts at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Firm’s 
undivided interests in the credit card trusts and 
securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. 
Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization 
trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated 
and purchased residential mortgages, commercial 
mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its 
CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular 
transaction, as well as the respective business 
involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans 
and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the 
securitization trusts.
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label 
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are 
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or 
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or 
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is 
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value 
of these interests. Refer to page 279 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies and 
liquidation losses.

2023, respectively.
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans 
originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage 
loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or 
CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential 
mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for 
certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For 
securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has 
the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE 
because it is responsible for decisions related to loan 
modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an 
interest upon securitization.
In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving securities issued by Firm-
sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at 
times retains senior and/or subordinated interests 
(including residual interests and amounts required to 
be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in 
residential mortgage securitizations at the time of 
securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the 
secondary market in the normal course of business. In 
certain instances, as a result of the positions retained 
or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or 
CCB, when considered together with the servicing 
arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is 
deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain 
securitization trusts. 
The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage 
securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-
sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore 
does not have the power to direct the most significant 
activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial 
interest in the trust that could potentially be significant 
to the trust.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer 
securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage 
loans, and engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving the securities issued by 
securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/
or subordinated interests (including amounts required 
to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in 
commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of 
securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service 
commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO 
may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. 
For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to 
direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is 
held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of 
securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally 
does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its 
sponsored commercial mortgage securitization 
transactions.
Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization 
transactions in which debt securities are transferred to 
a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These 
transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and 
government agency sponsored VIEs, which are 
backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s 
consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the 
Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.
The following table presents the principal amount of 
securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.
Year ended December 31,

2022
Transfers of securities to VIEs

agencies
$ 44,456 
$ 18,864 
$ 16,128 
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved 
are client-driven transactions in which a specific client 
or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk 
profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded 
that the decision-making power of the entity is shared 
between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint 
effort and decisions in establishing the re-
securitization trust and its assets, as well as the 
significant economic interest the client holds in the re-
securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not 
consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to 
re-securitization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored 
VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not 
material.
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests 
of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and 
generally purchases these interests in the secondary 
market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not 
have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant 
activities of the re-securitization trust, either because 
it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or 
the Firm was involved with an independent third-party 
sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the 
creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not 
consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

label re-securitization VIEs.
Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy 
remote entities that provide secured financing, 
collateralized by pools of receivables and other 
financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The 
conduits fund their financing facilities through the 
issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The 
primary source of repayment of the commercial paper 
is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most 
instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific 
credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the 
customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-
specific credit enhancements are generally structured 
to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the 
pool of assets, and are typically in the form of 
overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-
specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s 
potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.
To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, 
and to provide the conduits with funding to provide 
financing to customers in the event that the conduits 
do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, 
each asset pool financed by the conduits has a 
minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility 
associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the 
multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted 
program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide 
credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of 
credit. The amount of program-wide credit 
enhancement required is based upon commercial 
paper issuance and approximates 10% of the 
outstanding balance of commercial paper.
The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-
seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to 
direct the significant activities of the conduits and a 
potentially significant economic interest in the 
conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in 
structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions 
regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages 
the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. 
The Firm’s interests that could potentially be 
significant to the VIEs include the fees received as 
administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide 
credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential 
exposure created by the liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.
In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase 
makes markets in and invests in commercial paper 
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. 
The Firm held $2.9 billion and $9.8 billion of the 
commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, which have been eliminated in 
consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the 
Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven 
by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required 
to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the 
Firm is not obligated under any agreement to 
purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity 
and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have 
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-
related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded 
commitments were $10.3 billion and $10.8 billion at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are 
reported as off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments in other unfunded commitments to 
extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information 
on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB 
transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal 
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by 
issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-
rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-
rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are 
typically purchased by money market funds or other 
short-term investors and may be tendered, with 
requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are 
retained by the investor seeking to finance its 
municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where 
the residual is held by a third-party investor are 
typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-
customer TOB trusts are transactions where the 
Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts 
are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as 
sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The 
Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, 
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option 
provider, and/or sponsor.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing 
agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing 
agent is responsible for establishing the periodic 
variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
274
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The 
remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make 
markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not 
material during 2024 and 2023.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities 
LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option 
provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s 
obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by 
certain events (“Termination Events”), which include 
bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond 
issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of 
taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate 
downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment 
grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is 
typically further limited by the high credit quality of the 
underlying municipal bonds, the excess 
collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain 
transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the 
Residual holders.
Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their 
floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent 
cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another 
investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to 
the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the 
floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. 
TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest 
entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB 
trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the 
right to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, 
and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses 
that could potentially be significant to the municipal 
bond vehicle.

VIEs sponsored by third parties 
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured 
by other parties. These include, for example, acting as 
a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, 
trustee or custodian. These transactions are 
conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit 
decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, 
taking into consideration the quality of the underlying 
assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to 
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly 
impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable 
interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm 
generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated 
balance sheets in the same manner it would record 
and report positions in respect of any other third-party 
transaction. 
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax 
credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and 
similar entities that own and operate affordable 
housing, alternative energy, and other projects. These 
entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is 
typically the general partner or managing member and 
has control over the significant activities of the tax 
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally 
invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and 
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax 
credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss 
exposure, represented by equity investments and 
funding commitments, was $35.2 billion and $35.1 
billion, of which $15.0 billion and $14.7 billion was 
unfunded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to 
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts 
of its capital investment until the project qualifies for 
tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on 
off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to 
the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures Using the Proportional Amortization 
Method guidance which expanded the types of tax-
oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax 
credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a 
program by program basis, to be accounted for using 
the proportional amortization method. Refer to Notes 
1, 6 and 25 for further information.
The proportional amortization method requires the 
cost of eligible investments, within an elected 
program, be amortized in proportion to the tax 
benefits received with the resulting amortization 
reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns 
with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. 
Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, 
including that substantially all of the return is from 
income tax credits and other income tax benefits.
In addition, under this method deferred taxes are 
generally not recorded as the investment is now 
amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and 
other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity 
contributions that are unconditional and legally 
binding or conditional and probable of occurring are 
recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding 
increase in the carrying value of the investment. The 
guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible 
investments when significant modifications or events 
occur that result in a change in the nature of the 
investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with 
the underlying project. During the period, there were 
no significant modifications or events that resulted in a 
change in the nature of an eligible investment or a 
change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying 
project.
The following table provides information on tax-
oriented investments for which the Firm elected to 
apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) 
The Firm may provide various services to customer 
TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or 
tender option provider. In certain customer TOB 
transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has 
entered into a reimbursement agreement with the 
Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the 
termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the 
third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm 
does not have any intent to protect Residual holders 
from potential losses on any of the underlying 
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.
The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider 
to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2024 and 
2023, was $5.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. 
The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $8.1 billion and $7.3 
billion, respectively.
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgages, credit card 
receivables, commercial mortgages and other 
consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization 
transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to 
generate liquidity for the Firm.
For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not 
required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the 
transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale 
when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale 
are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally 
isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or 
beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the 
transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not 
maintain effective control over the transferred financial 
assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the 
transferred assets before their maturity and it does not 
have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to 
return the transferred assets).
For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the 
Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference 
between the value of proceeds received (including 
cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) 
and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and 
losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest 
revenue.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-

transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the 
securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the 
normal course of business, sells originated and 
purchased mortgage loans and certain originated 
excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly 
to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold 
primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. 
GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells 
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to 
Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically 
insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government 
agency. The Firm does not consolidate the 
securitization vehicles underlying these transactions 
as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited 
number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a 
portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional 
information about the Firm’s loan sales- and 
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 15 for 
additional information about the impact of the Firm’s 
sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase 
certain loans due to material breaches of 
representations and warranties as discussed in Note 
28, the Firm also has the option to repurchase 
delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan 
pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies 
under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects 
to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage 
the foreclosure process in accordance with the 
applicable requirements, and such loans continue to 
be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase 
option becomes exercisable, such loans must be 
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan 
with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information. 
The following table presents loans the Firm 
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real 
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed 
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s 
Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024

Note 15 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business 
combination as the difference between the purchase 
price and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and 
can be adjusted up to one year from the acquisition 
date as additional information pertaining to facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is 
obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more 
often if events or circumstances, such as adverse 
changes in the business climate, indicate that there 
may be an impairment.
The goodwill associated with each business 
combination is allocated to the related reporting units, 
which are generally determined based on how the 
Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are 
reviewed. The following table presents goodwill 
attributed to the reportable business segments and

(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments.
Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022.
The goodwill impairment test is generally performed 
by comparing the current fair value of each reporting 
unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess 
of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill 
is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less 
than the carrying value, then an impairment is 
recognized for the amount by which the reporting 
unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the 
amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital 
plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for 
the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in 
the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity 
is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of 
capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a 
variety of factors including capital levels of similarly 
rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are 
incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, 
which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and 
Operating Committee. 
The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair 
value of its reporting units is the income approach. 
This approach projects cash flows for the forecast 
period and uses the perpetuity growth method to 
calculate terminal values. These cash flows and 
terminal values, which are based on the reporting 
units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then 
discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The 
discount rate used for each reporting unit represents 
an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit 
and is determined considering the Firm’s overall 
estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital 
Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk 
characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for 
example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty 
associated with the business or management’s 
forecasts and assumptions). To assess the 
reasonableness of the discount rates used for each 
reporting unit, management compares the discount 
rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded 
institutions with similar businesses and risk 
characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost 
of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is 
compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of 
equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived 
from the discounted cash flow analysis are then 
compared with market-based trading and transaction 
multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and 
transaction comparables are used as general 
indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the 
estimated fair values, although precise conclusions 
generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
280
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and 
competitor institutions. 
The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison 
between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s 
reporting units and JPMorganChase’s market 
capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm 
considers several factors, including (i) a control 
premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) 
factors related to the level of execution risk that would 
exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the 
reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility 
and other factors that do not directly affect the value of 
individual reporting units.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, 
increases in credit losses, increases in capital 
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or 
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative 
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of 
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the 
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which 
could result in a material impairment loss to earnings 
in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill. 
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash 
flows for performing servicing activities for others. The 
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees 
and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to 
service the loans, and generally declines over time as 
net servicing cash flows are received, effectively 
amortizing the MSR asset against contractual 
servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either 
purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale 
or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is 
retained.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to 
account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its 
MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the 
availability of market inputs used to measure the fair 
value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as 
one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. 
The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an 
option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects 
MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in 
conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and 
then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. 
The model considers portfolio characteristics, 
contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment 
assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late 
charges and other ancillary revenue, and other 
economic factors. The Firm compares fair value 
estimates and assumptions to observable market data 
where available, and also considers recent market 
activity and actual portfolio experience. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
281
The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in 
interest rates, including their effect on prepayment 
speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when 
interest rates decline because declining interest rates 
tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce 
the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that 
comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., 
mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives 
(e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate 
interest payments) increase in value when interest 
rates decline. JPMorganChase uses combinations of 
derivatives and securities to manage the risk of 
changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to 
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair 
value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the 
related risk management instruments.

reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk 
associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to 
investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, 
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in 
assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, 
because the relationship of the change in the 
assumptions to the change in fair value are often 
highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the 
following table, the effect that a change in a particular 
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated 
without changing any other assumption. In reality, 
changes in one factor may result in changes in 
another, which would either magnify or counteract the 
impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic 
assumptions used to determine the fair value of the 
Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and 
outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to 
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as 
defined below.

Other intangible assets
The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other 
intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair 
value primarily upon completion of a business 
combination. Subsequently, the Firm’s finite-lived 
intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, 
customer relationship intangibles, and certain other 
intangible assets, are amortized over their useful lives, 
estimated based on the expected future economic 
benefits to the Firm of the intangible asset. The Firm’s 
intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as asset 
management contracts, are not subject to 
amortization and are assessed periodically for 
impairment.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross carrying 
values of other intangible assets were $3.8 billion and 
$4.2 billion, respectively, and the accumulated 
amortization was $879 million and $994 million, 
respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net carrying 
values consist of finite-lived intangible assets of $1.7 
billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as well as 
indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject 
to amortization, of $1.2 billion at both periods.
As of December 31, 2024, other intangible assets 
reflected core deposit and certain wealth management 
customer relationship intangibles related to the First 
Republic acquisition, and asset management 
contracts related to the Firm’s acquisition of the 
remaining 51% interest in CIFM. Refer to Note 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
amortization expense was $339 million and $315 
million, respectively. 
The following table presents estimated future 
amortization expense.

Impairment testing
The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other 
intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually 
or more often if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the asset might be impaired. Once the 
Firm determines that an impairment exists for an 
intangible asset, the impairment is recognized in other 
expense.

(b) Other premises and equipment is comprised of internal-use 
software and furniture and equipment.
JPMorganChase computes depreciation using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful life for 
buildings and furniture and equipment. The Firm 
depreciates leasehold improvements over the lesser of 
the remainder of the lease term or the estimated useful 
life. The Firm also capitalizes certain costs associated 
with the acquisition or development of internal-use 
software. Once the software is ready for its intended 
use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over the software’s expected useful life. The estimated 
useful lives range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and 
leasehold improvements, and 3 to 10 years for internal-
use software and furniture and equipment.
Impairment is assessed when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an 
asset may not be fully recoverable.

Note 18 - Leases
Firm as lessee
At December 31, 2024, JPMorganChase and its 
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of 
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases 
for premises and equipment used primarily for 
business purposes. These leases generally have terms 
of 20 years or less, determined based on the 
contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods 
covered by options to extend or terminate the lease 
when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise 
those options. All leases with lease terms greater than 
twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a 
corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of 
these lease agreements impose restrictions on the 
Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or 
equity financing transactions or enter into further lease 
agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation 
clauses that will increase rental payments based on 
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-
lease components. The Firm elected not to separate 
lease and non-lease components of a contract for its 
real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments 
represent payments on both lease and non-lease 
components. 
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are 
recognized at the lease commencement date based 
on the present value of the future minimum lease 
payments over the lease term. The future lease 
payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the 
Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing 
instruments of a similar term and are included in 
accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating 
lease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises 
and equipment, also include any lease prepayments 
made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease 
incentives received. Rental expense associated with 
operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term, and generally included in 
occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of 
income. 
The carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases

Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing 
to its customers through lease arrangements with 
lease terms that may contain renewal, termination 
and/or purchase options. The Firm’s lease financings 
are predominantly auto operating leases. These assets 
subject to operating leases are recognized in other 
assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual 
value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, 
communications and equipment expense in the 
Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease 
income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term and is included in other income in 
the Consolidated statements of income. 
On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets 
for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the 
leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows 
from the lease payments and the estimated residual 
value upon disposition of the leased asset, an 
impairment is recognized. 
The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets 
relating to the residual value of the leased assets is 
monitored through projections of the asset residual 
values at lease origination and periodic review of 
residual values, and is mitigated through 
arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees.

The credit card rewards liability represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected 
to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued 
as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced 
when the cardholder redeems points. The redemption 
rate and cost per point assumptions are key 
assumptions to estimate the liability and the current 
period impact is recognized in Card Income.

liabilities, income taxes and litigation reserves, 
respectively.

(a) Reflects the Purchase Money Note associated with First Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional information.
(b) Included long-term debt of $80.9 billion and $93.0 billion secured by assets totaling $185.5 billion and $218.5 billion at December 31, 2024 
and 2023, respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. 
(c) Included $100.8 billion and $87.9 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
(d) Included $13.5 billion and $12.5 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate 
principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $50.2 billion and $47.9 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount 
reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if 
applicable.
(e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included amounts accounted for at fair 
value which were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial 
interests of $21.8 billion and $19.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
(f) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, including non-
U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting 
relationships, if applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.
(g) As of December 31, 2024, long-term debt in the aggregate of $297.1 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorganChase, in whole or in 
part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.
(h) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2024 is $41.0 billion in 2025, $64.5 billion in 2026,

The weighted-average contractual interest rates for 
total long-term debt excluding structured notes 
accounted for at fair value were 3.82% and 3.65% as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to 
modify exposure to interest rate and currency 
exchange rate movements, JPMorganChase utilizes 
derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and 
cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with 
some of its debt issuances. The use of these 
instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on 
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average 
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the 
effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.15% 
and 5.20% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-
term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured 
notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the 
Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-
term debt and structured notes was $41.2 billion and 
$41.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. 
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future 
borrowings or require additional collateral, based on 
unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, 
financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 21 – Preferred stock
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, JPMorganChase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one 
or more series, with a par value of $1 per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm, JPMorganChase’s 
preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of 
dividends and the distribution of assets.
The following is a summary of JPMorganChase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024 
and 2023, and the quarterly dividend declarations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

On June 28, 2024, the Firm announced that its Board 
of Directors had authorized a new $30 billion common 
share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2024. 
Through June 30, 2024, the Firm was authorized to 
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its 
previously-approved common share repurchase 
program that was announced on April 13, 2022.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. As part of the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax is imposed on net share 
repurchases commencing January 1, 2023.
(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended 
share repurchases, which it resumed in the first quarter of 2023 
under its common share repurchase program.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s 
discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase 
program approved by the Board of Directors does not 
establish specific price targets or timetables. 
Management determines the amount and timing of 
common share repurchases based on various factors, 
including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking 
into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and other investment opportunities. The 
amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases 
in any period may be substantially more or less than 
the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in 
prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the 
decision-making process. The Firm’s common share 
repurchases may be suspended by management at 
any time; and may be executed through open market 
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or 
utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading 
plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time 
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise 
not be repurchasing common shares — for example, 
during internal trading blackout periods.
As of December 31, 2024, approximately 58.8 million 
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance 
under various employee incentive, compensation, 
option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ 
compensation plans.

Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using 
the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all 
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated 
to common stock and participating securities. 
JPMorganChase grants RSUs under its share-based 
compensation programs, predominantly all of which 
entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to 
dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. 
These unvested RSUs meet the definition of 
participating securities based on their respective 
rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are 
treated as a separate class of securities in computing 
basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as 
incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to 
Note 9 for additional information.
Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of 
contingently issuable shares, including awards which 
require future service as a condition of delivery of the 
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated 
under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, 
and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of 
the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS 
calculated under the two-class method was more 
dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of net 
income applicable to common stockholders and basic 
and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022.

the Consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax gain of $7 million to 
other income/expense, of which $89 million gain related to net investment hedges and $(82) million loss related to cumulative translation 
adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $(3) million. During the year ended 
December 31, 2022, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $(8) million.
(c) Represents changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads, which are excluded from

recognized in earnings as part of the accrual of interest on the cross-currency swaps. 
(d) The pre-tax amounts are primarily recorded in noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense in the Consolidated 
statements of income.
(e) During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required 
as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI.

Note 25 – Income taxes
JPMorganChase and its eligible subsidiaries file a 
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. 
JPMorganChase uses the asset and liability method to 
provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method 
requires that income taxes reflect the expected future 
tax consequences of temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book 
and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or 
liability for each temporary difference is determined 
based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in 
effect when the underlying items of income and 
expense are realized. JPMorganChase’s expense for 
income taxes includes the current and deferred 
portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is 
established to reduce deferred tax assets to the 
amount the Firm expects to realize. 
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the 
nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting 
business and being taxed in a substantial number of 
jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are 
required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities 
between JPMorganChase and the many tax 
jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not 
be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-
related assets and liabilities may ultimately be 
different from those currently reported.
Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to 
the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures Using the Proportional Amortization 
Method guidance, under the modified retrospective 
method. Refer to Notes 1, 6 and 14 for additional 
information.

Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity
The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of 
certain items that are recorded each period directly in 
stockholders’ equity, which are predominantly 
reflected in OCI as disclosed in Note 24. For the year 
ended December 31, 2024, stockholders’ equity 
reflected the tax effect associated with the Firm’s 
adoption of the Accounting for Investments in Tax 
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization 
Method guidance. For the year ended December 31, 
2023, stockholders’ equity  reflected the tax effect 
associated with the Firm’s adoption of the TDR 
accounting guidance. Both of the respective adoptions 
were recognized in retained earnings. Refer to Note 1, 
6 and 14 for further information.

Deferred taxes 
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) reflects the 
differences between assets and liabilities measured 
for financial reporting purposes versus income tax 
return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is 
determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax 
asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation 
allowance is established. The significant components 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the 
following table, the net deferred tax assets are 
reflected in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets.

JPMorganChase has recorded deferred tax assets of 
$352 million at December 31, 2024 in connection with 
tax attribute carryforwards. State and local capital loss 
carryforwards were $914 million, U.S. federal NOL 
carryforwards were $496 million, non-U.S. NOL 
carryforwards were $958 million, and other U.S. federal 
tax attributes were $111 million. If not utilized, a portion 
of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. 
federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 
2036 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward 
period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards 
will expire between 2026 and 2041 whereas others 
have an unlimited carryforward period. The state and 
local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026.  
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2024, was 
predominantly driven by certain non-U.S. deferred tax 
assets, including NOL carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits
At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax benefits, 
excluding related interest expense and penalties, were 
$6.2 billion, $5.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, of 
which $4.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.8 billion, 
respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual 
effective tax rate. Included in the amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would 
not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized 
in the Consolidated statements of income. These 
unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain 
temporary differences, the portion of gross state and 
local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by 
the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax 
deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. 
unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in 
other jurisdictions. JPMorganChase evaluates the 
need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based 
on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of 
its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In 
addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number 
of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal 
Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax 
examination status table below. The evaluation of 
unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for 
audit settlements make it reasonably possible that 
over the next 12 months the gross balance of 
unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease 
by as much as approximately $2.4 billion. The change 
in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a 
payment or income statement recognition. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the 
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax 
benefits.

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted 
assets and intercompany funds transfers 
Restricted cash and other restricted assets 
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted 
as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are 
imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the 
particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. 
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to 
examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a 
member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its 
deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to 
applicable limits. 
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at 
certain non-US central banks.  
The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations 
established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As 
part of its compliance with the respective regulatory 
requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are 
subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets. 
The following table presents the components of the 
Firm’s restricted cash:

Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively.
Also, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm had 
the following other restricted assets: 
• Cash and securities pledged with clearing 
organizations for the benefit of customers of $40.7 
billion and $40.5 billion, respectively.  
• Securities with a fair value of $26.8 billion and $20.5 
billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to 
customer activity.
Intercompany funds transfers 
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from 
lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) 
and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured 
in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by 
any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any 
particular affiliate, together with certain other 
transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to 
as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and 
conditions that are consistent with safe and sound 
banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with 
cash or US Government debt obligations, covered 
transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking 
subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-
based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of 
covered transactions between any banking subsidiary 
and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking 
subsidiary’s total capital.
The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the 
“IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of 
JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns 
other assets and provides intercompany loans to the 
Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to 
contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds 
received from securities issuances (including issuances 
of senior and subordinated debt securities and of 
preferred and common stock).
The principal sources of income and funding for the 
Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from 
the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in 
statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC 
and the FDIC have authority under the Financial 
Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the 
payment of dividends by the banking organizations they 
supervise, including the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, 
if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a 
dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
practice in light of the financial condition of the banking 
organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying 
dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if 
certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if 
limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s 
management or Board of Directors.
At January 1, 2025, the Parent Company’s banking 
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately 
$15.5 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding 
companies without the prior approval of their relevant 
banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 
2025 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ 
earnings during the year.

Note 27 – Regulatory capital 
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum 
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards 
for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding 
companies and banks, including the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the rules currently 
in effect, two comprehensive approaches are 
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against 
the lower of the Standardized or Advanced 
approaches compared to their respective regulatory 
capital ratio requirements.
The three components of regulatory capital under the 
Basel III rules and their primary drivers are as 
illustrated below:
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based 
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase & 
Co. is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 
capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and 
the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements 
could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these 
capital requirements established by its primary 
regulators. 
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory 
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios 
to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
were subject as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital 
conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL 
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased 
out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm’s CET1 capital 
reflected the remaining benefit of $720 million and 
$1.4 billion, respectively, associated with the CECL 
capital transition provisions. 
Similarly, as of January 1, 2024, the Firm has phased 
out 75% of the other CECL capital transition provisions 
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as 
applicable.
The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced 
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and 
met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and 
other commitments
JPMorganChase provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to 
address the financing needs of its customers and 
clients. The contractual amount of these financial 
instruments represents the maximum possible credit 
risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw 
upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill 
its obligation under the guarantee, and should the 
customer or client subsequently fail to perform 
according to the terms of the contract. Most of these 
commitments and guarantees have historically been 
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the 
total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in 
the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future 
credit exposure or funding requirements. 
To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for 
further information regarding the allowance for credit 
losses on lending-related commitments.
The following table summarizes the contractual 
amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet 
lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and 
other commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The amounts in the table below for credit card, home 
equity  and certain scored business banking lending-
related commitments represent the total available 
credit for these products. The Firm has not 
experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available 
lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at 
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these 
commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to 
the extent otherwise permitted by law, including  when 
there has been a demonstrable decline in the 
creditworthiness of the borrower or significant 
decrease in the value of underlying property.

Note 34 for additional information.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit 
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit 
generally consist of commitments for working capital 
and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit 
to support commercial paper facilities and bond 
financings in the event that those obligations cannot 
be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed 
liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm 
also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities 
which could be drawn upon in several forms, including 
the issuance of a standby letter of credit. 
Guarantees 
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the 
inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal 
to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing 
the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a 
contract that contingently requires the guarantor to 
pay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in 
an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the 
guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to 
perform under a specified agreement. The Firm 
considers the following off–balance sheet 
arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: 
standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, 
certain indemnification agreements included within 
third-party contractual arrangements, certain 
derivative contracts and the guarantees under the 
sponsored member repo program. 
As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records 
guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-
contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of 
consideration received or the net present value of the 
premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm 
records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an 
offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums 
received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). 
Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is 
reduced as cash is received under the contract, and 
the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is 
amortized into income as lending and deposit-related 
fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The 
lending-related contingent obligation is recognized 
based on expected credit losses in addition to, and 
separate from, any non-contingent obligation.
Non-lending-related contingent obligations are 
recognized when the liability becomes probable and 
reasonably estimable. These obligations are not 
recognized if the estimated amount is less than the 
carrying amount of any non-contingent liability 
recognized at inception (adjusted for any 
amortization). Examples of non-lending-related 
contingent obligations include indemnifications 
provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the 
sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which 
adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result 
from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the 
initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk 
is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification 
expires).
The contractual amount and carrying value of 
guarantees and indemnifications are included in the 
table on page 303.
For additional information on the guarantees, see 
below. 
Standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees 
Standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees are conditional lending commitments 
issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a 
client or customer to a third party under certain 
arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, 
bond financings, acquisition financings, trade 
financings and similar transactions. 
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other 
financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Securities lending indemnifications 
Through the Firm’s securities lending program, 
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-
custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. 
As part of this program, the Firm provides an 
indemnification in the lending agreements which 
protects the lender against the failure of the borrower 
to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability 
under these indemnification agreements, the Firm 
obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a 
market value exceeding 100% of the value of the 
securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is 
marked to market daily to help assure that 
collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is 
called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or 
collateral may be released to the borrower in the event 
of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm 
would use the collateral held to purchase replacement 
securities in the market or to credit the lending client 
or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. 
The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested 
on behalf of the client in indemnified resale 
agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client 
against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its 
liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains 
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the 
principal invested.
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that 
have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. 
GAAP. These contracts include written put options 
that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise 
by the option holder at a specified price by a specified 
date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put 
option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for 
other trading purposes. The terms of written put 
options are typically five years or less. 
Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes 
stable value contracts, commonly referred to as 
“stable value products”, that require the Firm to make 
a payment of the difference between the market value 
and the book value of a counterparty’s reference 
portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less 
than book value and certain other conditions have 
been met. Stable value products are transacted in 
order to allow investors to realize investment returns 
with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These 
contracts are typically longer-term or may have no 
stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to 
terminate the contract under certain conditions. 
The notional value of derivative guarantees generally 
represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, 
exposure to certain stable value products is 
contractually limited to a substantially lower 
percentage of the notional amount. 
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the 
probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will 
be required to perform under the contract. The Firm 
reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into 
offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts 
that hedge the market risk related to the derivative 
guarantees. 
The following table summarizes the derivatives 
qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a 
purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit 
derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of credit derivatives. 
Unsettled securities financing agreements 
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into 
resale and securities borrowed agreements. At 
settlement, these commitments result in the Firm 
advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral 
from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into 
repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At 
settlement, these commitments result in the Firm 
receiving cash from and providing securities collateral 
to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future 
date. These agreements generally do not meet the 
definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not 
recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until 
settlement date. These agreements predominantly  
have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for 
a further discussion of securities financing 
agreements. 
Loan sales- and securitization-related 
indemnifications 
Mortgage repurchase liability 
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has 
made representations and warranties that the loans 
sold meet certain requirements, and that may require 
the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or 
indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations 
and warranties are breached by the Firm. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
305
Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated 
with private label securitizations is separately 
evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation 
reserves. 
Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding 
litigation. 
Loans sold with recourse 
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain 
commercial lending products on both a recourse and 
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the 
principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary 
servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing 
advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees 
to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage 
loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private 
investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse 
servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales 
proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan 
are less than the sum of the outstanding principal 
balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost 
of holding and disposing of the underlying property. 
The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly 
nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk 
of future credit losses to the purchaser of the 
mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The 
unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as 
well as the carrying value of the related liability that the 
Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is 
representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will 
have to perform under its recourse obligations, are 
disclosed in the table on page 303.
Other off-balance sheet arrangements 
Indemnification agreements – general 
In connection with issuing securities to investors 
outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional 
amounts to the holders of the securities in the event 
that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of 
withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the 
securities. The terms of the securities may also give 
the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such 
additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also 
enter into indemnification clauses such as in 
connection with the licensing of software to clients 
(“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or 
assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), 
pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for 
claims of liability or damages that may occur 
subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-
party purchasers for losses they may incur due to 
actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the 
business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s 
maximum exposure under these indemnification 
arrangements, since this would require an assessment 
of future changes in tax law and future claims that may 
be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. 
However, based on historical experience, 
management expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
Merchant charge-backs  
Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a 
merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services 
business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability 
for disputed processed credit and debit card 
transactions that result in a charge-back to the 
merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s 
favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing 
bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder 
and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If 
the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the 
merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount 
credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm 
mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, 
retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other 
collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation 
allowance that covers the payment or performance 
risk related to charge-backs. 
Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by 
entering into securities purchases and sales and 
derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as 
futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative 
contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands 
behind the performance of its clients, collects cash 
and securities collateral (margin) as well as any 
settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits 
them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. 
There are two types of margin: variation margin is 
posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ 
derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at 
inception of a derivative contract, generally on the 
basis of the potential changes in the variation margin 
requirement for the contract. 
As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk 
of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to 
clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where 
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client 
through the collection of appropriate amounts of 
margin at inception and throughout the life of the 
transactions. The Firm can also cease providing 
clearing services if clients do not adhere to their 
obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event 
of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close 
out the client’s positions and access available margin. 
The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make 
itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to 
be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
306
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk 
of the client through the recognition of margin 
receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; 
the clients’ underlying securities or derivative 
contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible 
exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this 
would require an assessment of transactions that 
clients may execute in the future. However, based 
upon historical experience, and the credit risk 
mitigants available to the Firm, management believes 
it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any 
material payments under these arrangements and the 
risk of loss is expected to be remote. 
Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that 
the Firm executes for its own account and records in 
its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Exchange & Clearing House Memberships 
The Firm is a member of several securities and 
derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the 
U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing 
services to its clients. Membership in some of these 
organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share 
of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of 
the default of another member. Such obligations vary 
with different organizations. These obligations may be 
limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of 
the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund 
maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of 
the resources available to cover any losses in the event 
of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations 
may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses 
after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain 
clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a 
pro rata share of losses that may result from the 
clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund 
contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and 
independent of the default of another 
member. Generally a payment would only be required 
should such losses exceed the resources of the 
clearing house or exchange that are contractually 
required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In 
certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s 
maximum possible exposure under these membership 
agreements, since this would require an assessment of 
future claims that may be made against the Firm that 
have not yet occurred. However, based on historical 
experience, management expects the risk of loss to 
the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum 
possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is 
disclosed in the table on page 303, in the Exchange & 
clearing house guarantees and commitments line.  
Sponsored member repo program 
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Securities Division of the 
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf 
of clients that become sponsored members under the 
FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the 
prompt and full payment and performance of its 
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations 
under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability 
under these guarantees by obtaining a security 
interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral 
that the clients place with the clearing house; 
therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be 
remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, 
without taking into consideration the associated 
collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house 
guarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer 
to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk 
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the 
types of collateral pledged under repurchase 
agreements. 
Guarantees of subsidiaries 
In the normal course of business, the Parent Company 
may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain 
of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries 
on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the 
Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the 
subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet 
commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not 
recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. 
The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event 
that would trigger payments by the Parent Company 
under these guarantees is remote. 
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-
term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, 
including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC 
(“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All 
securities issued by JPMFC are fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company 
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company 
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which 
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and 
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the 
table on page 303 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for 
additional information.

Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral 
Pledged assets 
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to 
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount 
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other 
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm 
pledges assets for other purposes, including to 
collateralize repurchase and other securities financing 
agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize 
derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these 
pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as 
assets pledged.
The following table presents the carrying value of the 
Firm’s pledged assets.

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of December 31, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries 
and affiliates are defendants or respondents in 
numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private 
proceedings, public proceedings, government 
investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the 
matters described below. The litigations range from 
individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class 
action lawsuits with potentially millions of class 
members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement 
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, 
by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory 
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying 
stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and 
involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several 
geographies and a wide variety of claims (including 
common law tort and contract claims and statutory 
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), 
some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range 
of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses was based upon information available as of that 
date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes 
that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be 
made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe 
that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The 
Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably 
possible losses involves significant judgment, given:
• the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
• the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of 
liability (if any) has yet to be determined, 
• the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
• the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of 
such proceedings, including where the Firm has made 
assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or 
other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives 
of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those 
assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may 
be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses 
may vary significantly.
Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material 
legal proceedings.
1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as 
a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in 
Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a 
Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. 
The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. 
Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of 
$300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, 
respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an 
account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB 
PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 
1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In 
March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to 
the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s 
jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been 
appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an 
application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with 
permission to re-file a new claim in the future. That 
decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and 
an appeals court is scheduled to hear both appeals in 
November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent 
any claim from continuing.   
In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the 
Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. 
Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an 
investigation into possible criminal liability in 
connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan 
(Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi 
joint venture and its related persons for the period 
September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG 
investigation is ongoing. 
Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by 
JPMorganChase entities into residential housing 
projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) 
relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver 
residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order 
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately 
$31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. 
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India 
issued an order making preliminary findings that 
Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified 
JPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had 
invested in the projects, violated certain criminal 
currency control and money laundering provisions, and 
ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is 
responding to and cooperating with the inquiry.   
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The 
Firm previously reported settlements with certain 
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange 
(“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to 
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, 
the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal 
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted 
the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
309
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional 
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the 
ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust 
plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental 
inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission 
matter which is currently pending before the South 
Africa Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related 
individual and putative class actions filed outside the 
U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil 
and Australia, remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of 
Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's 
earlier denial of a request for class certification on an 
opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this 
decision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a 
settlement in principle has been reached on the 
putative class action, which remains subject to court 
approval. 
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints 
alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain 
banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit 
card interchange fees and enacted related rules in 
violation of antitrust laws.
In September 2018, the parties settled the class action 
seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively 
contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement 
has been approved by the United States District Court 
for the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on 
appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that 
opted out of the settlement, $700 million has been 
returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. 
A separate class action seeking injunctive relief 
continues, and in September 2021, the District Court 
granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, 
and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District 
Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the 
injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard 
agreed to certain changes to their respective network 
rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates 
for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering 
next steps. 
Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class 
settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, 
as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some 
of those actions remain pending, the defendants have 
reached settlements with the merchants who opted out 
representing over 70% of the combined Mastercard-
branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. 
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation. JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries 
from various governmental agencies and entities 
around the world relating primarily to the British 
Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank 
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the 
European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered 
Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition 
Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to 
which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, 
continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 
decision by the European Commission against the Firm 
and other banks finding an infringement of European 
antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, 
the European General Court annulled the fine imposed 
by the European Commission, but exercised its 
discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In 
March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision 
with the Court of Justice of the European Union.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant 
along with other banks in various individual and putative 
class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. 
dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR 
during the period that it was administered by the BBA, 
the United States District Court for the Southern District 
of New York granted class certification of antitrust 
claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold 
directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm 
has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved 
certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has 
moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit 
filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust 
claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants 
were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. 
dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market 
for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was 
dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
in December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. 
dollar LIBOR actions.
Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with 
international sanctions laws, which mandate the 
blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when 
assets associated with individuals, companies, products 
or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The 
Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia 
seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, 
and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, 
relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and 
claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian 
courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual 
agreements concerning forum selection and did not 
recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not 
making payment. Russian courts have entered 
judgment against the Firm in a number of claims, 
including one for $439 million, and a judgment has been 
executed against assets held onshore by the Firm in 
Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the 
total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in 
Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian 
courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed 
while on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered 
interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, 
among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, 
shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of 
the named defendants) pending a determination of 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
310
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has 
challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts 
and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided 
for by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If further 
claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the 
Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the 
proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia 
could be seized in full, and certain client assets could 
also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from 
complying with its obligations.
SEC Inquiries. In October 2024, the Firm entered into 
settlements with the SEC to resolve inquiries related to, 
among other things, conflict disclosures concerning the 
selection of portfolio managers and the timing of the 
Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain 
investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed 
private funds and certain other matters. The resolutions 
required the Firm to pay a combined $151 million in civil 
penalties and voluntary payments to customers. The 
Firm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC 
inquiries concerning the aggregation of accounts for fee 
billing and various other matters.
Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative 
class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions 
purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed 
against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its 
current and former officers.  
Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical 
trading practices by former employees in the precious 
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct 
which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the 
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary 
activities that were separately the subject of a resolution 
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in 
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative 
suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New 
York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty 
and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical 
trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary 
activities which were the subject of the resolutions 
described above. In December 2022, the court granted 
defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in 
July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains 
pending. 
A second shareholder derivative action relating to the 
historical trading practices and related conduct was 
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York in December 2022. Defendants 
have moved to dismiss the complaint.
Zelle Network Litigation. In December 2024, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a 
complaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), 
Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District 
Court for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that 
EWS and the defendant banks have failed to take 
sufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. 
The defendants will file a response to the complaint.
*     *     *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named 
as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it 
has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against 
it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it 
intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal 
proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the 
future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred 
of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In 
accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for 
contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related 
liability when it is probable that such a liability has been 
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably 
estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal 
proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation 
reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $740 million, 
$1.4 billion and $266 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There 
is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will 
not need to be adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the 
outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the 
claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or 
where the matters present novel legal theories, involve 
a large number of parties or are in early stages of 
discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what 
will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending 
matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the 
eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences 
related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, 
based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not 
have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s 
consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, 
however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in 
such proceedings, there is no assurance that the 
ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly 
exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a 
matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among 
other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and 
the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period.

Note 31 – International operations 
The following table presents income statement and 
balance sheet-related information for JPMorganChase 
by major international geographic area. The Firm 
defines international activities for purposes of this 
footnote presentation as business transactions that 
involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the 
information presented below is based predominantly 
on the domicile of the client, the location from which 
the client relationship is managed, booking location or 
the location of the trading desk. However, many of the 
Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses.
As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, 
estimates and subjective assumptions have been 
made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. 
and international operations. These estimates and 
assumptions are consistent with the allocations used 
for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 
32.
The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented 
are not considered by management to be significant in 
relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-
lived assets are located in the U.S.

Note 32 – Business segments & Corporate
Business segment reorganization: Effective in the 
second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its 
reportable business segments by combining the former 
Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking 
business segments to form one reportable segment, 
the Commercial & Investment Bank. As a result of the 
reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business 
segments – Consumer & Community Banking, 
Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth 
Management – with the remaining activities in 
Corporate. 
Adoption of accounting standard — Segment 
Reporting — Improvements to Reportable Segment 
Disclosures: This guidance was adopted 
retrospectively for the Firm’s annual Consolidated 
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 
2024. The adoption of this guidance requires additional 
reportable segment disclosures, primarily relating to 
significant segment expenses and the chief operating 
decision maker (“CODM”). Adoption of this guidance did 
not result in changes to the identification of the Firm’s 
reportable business segments, or of its CODM.  
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. The business 
segments are determined based on the products and 
services provided, or the type of customer served, and 
they reflect the manner in which financial information is 
evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose 
members act collectively as the Firm’s CODM. Segment 
results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to 
Segment & Corporate results in this footnote for a 
further discussion of JPMorganChase’s reportable 
business segments and Corporate.
The following is a description of each of the Firm’s 
reportable business segments, and the products and 
services that they provide to their respective client 
bases, as well as a description of Corporate activities.
Consumer & Community Banking 
Consumer & Community Banking offers products and 
services to consumers and small businesses through 
bank branches, ATMs, digital (including mobile and 
online) and telephone banking. CCB is organized into 
Banking & Wealth Management (including Consumer 
Banking, Business Banking and J.P. Morgan Wealth 
Management), Home Lending (including Home Lending 
Production, Home Lending Servicing and Real Estate 
Portfolios) and Card Services & Auto. Banking & Wealth 
Management offers deposit, investment and lending 
products, cash management, payments and services. 
Home Lending includes mortgage origination and 
servicing activities, as well as portfolios consisting of 
residential mortgages and home equity loans. Card 
Services issues credit cards and offers travel services. 
Auto originates and services auto loans and leases. 
Commercial & Investment Bank
The Commercial & Investment Bank is comprised of the 
Banking & Payments and Markets & Securities Services 
businesses. These businesses offer investment 
banking, lending, payments, market-making, financing, 
custody and securities products and services to a 
global base of corporate and institutional clients. 
Banking & Payments offers products and services in all 
major capital markets, including advising on corporate 
strategy and structure, capital-raising in equity and

Office (“CIO”) and Other Corporate. Treasury and CIO is 
predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, 
reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, 
capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange 
risks.

that is centrally managed as well as certain Firm 
initiatives and activities not solely aligned to a specific 
LOB. The major Other Corporate functions include Real

Description of business segment reporting 
methodology
Results of the reportable business segments are 
intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-
alone business. The management reporting process 
that derives business segment results includes the 
allocation of certain income and expense items. The 
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements 
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also 
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on 
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide 
various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm 
and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance. 
Revenue sharing 
When business segments or businesses within each 
segment join efforts to sell products and services to 
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating 
businesses may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or 
service, with allocations to the other segments or 
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment 
and business results reflect these revenue-sharing 
agreements.
Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
Corporate support units, or another business segment, 
the costs of those services are allocated to the 
respective business segments. The expense is 
generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of 
services provided. In contrast, certain costs and 
investments related to Corporate that are not currently 
utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business 
segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were stand-
alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned 
with a particular reportable business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which 
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the 
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary 
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the 
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets 
and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. 
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions 
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect 
economic conditions and other factors, which may 
impact the allocation of net interest income to the 
segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the 
Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer 
deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding 
benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that 
is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s 
net interest income.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs 
and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain 
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages 
these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign 
exchange rate movements related to the transferred 
risk in its results.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the 
credit spread component of outstanding unsecured 
long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while 
the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-
term debt and preferred stock dividends to the 
business segments is aligned with the relevant 
regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of 
the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of 
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business 
segment’s net interest income, and net income is 
reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity.
Capital allocation
Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking 
into consideration a variety of factors including capital 
levels of similarly rated peers and applicable 
regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and 
internal targets for expected returns are established 
as key measures of an LOB’s performance.
The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology 
incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB 
surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well 
as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital 
are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to 
the LOBs and Corporate may change.

Segment & Corporate results 
The following table provides a summary of results for 
the Firm’s reportable business segments and 
Corporate activities as of or for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts 
with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue 
for the Firm as a whole (and for each of the reportable 
business segments and Corporate) on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. This allows management 
to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-
year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related 
to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax 
expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact 
on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by 
the each of the LOBs and Corporate.
The Operating Committee reviews segment results 
including net interest income, noninterest revenue, 
noninterest expense, provision for credit losses and 
net income on a managed basis. The Operating 
Committee uses these measures to evaluate segment 
performance and to make key operating decisions, 
including resource and capital allocations.

Note 34 – Business combinations
On May 1, 2023, JPMorganChase acquired certain 
assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic 
Bank (the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. 
The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, 
which represents the excess of the estimated fair value 
of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. 
The Firm has determined that this acquisition 
constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. 
Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed were generally 
measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 
2023. The determination of those fair values required 
management to make certain market-based 
assumptions about expected future cash flows, 
discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of 
the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value 
estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining 
the estimated bargain purchase gain. 
The First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary 
estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The 
final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects 
adjustments of $103 million and $63 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, made during the one-year measurement 
period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize 
management's fair value estimates for the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 
2024, certain matters related to the final settlement 
remained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. 
On January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement 
with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding 
items. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a 
payment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, 
2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, 
which will result in a gain of approximately 
$600 million to be recorded in other income in the first 
quarter of 2025.
In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the 
Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss 
agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-
related commitments (the "shared-loss assets"): the 
Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement ("CSLA") and the 
Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The 
CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu 
basis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery 
period for certain acquired commercial loans and 
other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of 
credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for 
certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real 
property or shares in cooperative property 
constituting a primary residence. The indemnification 
assets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and 
SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total 
assets acquired.
As part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase 
issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC 
(the "Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money 
Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is 
secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase 
Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder.
The Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First 
Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion 
of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. 
banks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectively 
settled as part of the acquisition and the associated 
allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. 
The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 
billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, 
including accrued interest through the payment date 
on May 9, 2023.

(b) As part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note").
(c) Includes $447 million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date.
(d) Other assets include $1.2 billion in tax-oriented investments and $683 million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related 
tax-oriented investment liabilities of $669 million and lease liabilities of $748 million. 
The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the 
following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss 
agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. 
For further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Notes 2 and 3 for fair 
value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and Note 28 for 
lending-related commitments.
Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles
Core deposit and certain wealth management 
customer relationship intangibles were acquired as 
part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit 
intangible of $1.3 billion was valued by discounting 
estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining 
useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of 
funds method. The after-tax cost savings were 
estimated based on the difference between the cost of 
maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost 
of next best alternative funding sources available to 
market participants. The customer relationship 
intangibles of $180 million were valued by discounting 
estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining 
useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings 
method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized 
assumptions that the Firm believes a market 
participant would use to estimate fair values, such as 
growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well 
as related costs to service the relationships, and 
discount rates. The core deposit and customer 
relationship intangibles are amortized over a projected 
period of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. 
Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other 
intangible assets.

Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements
The indemnification assets represent forecasted 
recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-
loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery 
periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at 
fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance 
sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the 
indemnification assets were estimated based on the 
timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related 
allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly 
remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based 
on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted 
losses in the allowance for credit losses associated 
with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other 
income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be 
required to make a payment to the FDIC upon 
termination of the shared-loss agreements based on 
the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-
loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is 
reflected as contingent consideration as part of the 
purchase price consideration.
Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances
The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term 
debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair 
value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated 
based on a discounted cash flow methodology and 
incorporated estimated market discount rates. 
The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are 
recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term 
debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based 
on a discounted cash flow methodology and 
considered the observed FHLB advance issuance 
rates.
Loans
The following table presents the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") and fair values of the loans acquired as of May 1,

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 
The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 
and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated 
bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion and the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion. Additional adjustments include 
the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value 
adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that 
are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the historical 
results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between 
volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the 
table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325 for more information on average balances and rates). 
In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual 
rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various 
products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without 
consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets 
and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in 
this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of 
changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all 
of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a 
manner similar to a derivative. An instrument containing 
such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The 
component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative 
instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, 
callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain 
vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded 
option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at 
a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the 
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate 
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate 
instrument and an interest rate swap.

price indices consist of actual data to the extent 
available and forecasted data where actual data is not

Mortgage origination channels:
Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home 
through direct contact with a mortgage banker 
employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet 
or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a 
mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real 
estate brokers, home builders or other third parties.
Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks 
and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to 
the Firm.
Mortgage product types: 
Alt-A 
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. 
Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more 
of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high 
CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied 
properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal 
limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans 
are those where a borrower does not provide complete 
documentation of his or her assets or the amount or 
source of his or her income. 
Option ARMs 
The option ARM real estate loan product is an 
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the 
borrower with the option each month to make a fully 
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The 
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on 
the interest rate charged during the introductory 
period. This introductory rate is usually significantly 
below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is 
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the 
introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate 
and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. 
The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover 
interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid 
interest is deferred and added to the principal balance 
of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment 
recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully 
amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance 
and anniversary date triggers. 
Prime 
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements 
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime 
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and 
generally have reliable payment histories. 
Subprime 
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) 
unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio 
of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage 
insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an 
occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is 
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than 
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by 
U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual 
status when full payment of principal and interest is not 
expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when 
principal and interest have been in default for a period 
of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured 
and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent 
loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and 
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, 
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial 
and personal property.

one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer. 
Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) 
derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated 
and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a 
central clearing house, such that each derivative 
counterparty is only exposed to the default of that 
clearing house. 
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage 
of total net revenue.
Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: Represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable 
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,

JPMorganChase grants RSUs to certain employees 
under its share-based compensation programs, which 
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the 
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These 
unvested awards meet the definition of participating 
securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings 
(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each 
class of common stock and participating securities, 
based on their respective rights to receive dividends.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority 
Preferred stock dividends: reflects dividends declared 
and deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred 
stock
Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net 
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes 
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the 
ability of a lending institution to generate income in 
excess of its provision for credit losses.
Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax 
expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in 
management’s view, a comprehensive measure of 
pretax performance derived by measuring earnings 
after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one 
basis upon which management evaluates the 
performance of AWM against the performance of their 
respective competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between 
the price at which a market participant is willing and 
able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at 
which another market participant is willing and able to 
buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, 
primarily used in client-driven market-making 
activities. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of 
transactions, or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial 
instruments that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized 
and unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge 
accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges 
of commodity and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management 
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
Production revenue: Includes fees and income 
recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated 
with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk 
management activities associated with the mortgage 
pipeline and warehouse loans. Production revenue also 
includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or 
fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale 
(excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies), and changes in the fair value of 
financial instruments measured under the fair value 
option.
PSU(s): Performance share units

accordance with regulatory rules.
REO: Real estate owned

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a 
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) 
which include capital requirements for credit risk, 
market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also 
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of 
credit risk RWA between the Standardized and 
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, 
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches 
which largely rely on the use of internal credit models 
and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type 
and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a 
generally consistent basis between Basel III 
Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

DESCRIPTION OF LISTED PREFERRED STOCK
The following summary is not complete. You should refer to our certificate of incorporation and to the Certificate of 
Designations, Powers, Preferences and Rights relating to each series of Listed Preferred Stock (as defined below), which 
we refer to herein as a certificate of designations, for the complete terms of that series of preferred stock. Copies of our 
certificate of incorporation and the certificate of designations for each series of Listed Preferred Stock are incorporated by 
reference as Exhibits to the Form 10-K. We encourage you to read our certificate of incorporation and the relevant 
certificates of designations for additional information.  
Authorized Shares
Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder action, to issue up 
to 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1 par value per share, which we refer herein to as preferred stock, in one or 
more series, and to determine the voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or 
other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each series. We may amend our certificate of 
incorporation to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of preferred stock in a manner permitted by our 
certificate of incorporation and the DGCL. 
Outstanding Preferred Stock
As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, we have 11 series of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The shares of each 
series of our preferred stock are represented by depositary shares, with each depositary share representing a fractional 
interest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series. Of the 11 series of our issued and outstanding preferred stock, 
depositary shares representing the following six series of preferred stock are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with each depositary share representing a 1/400th interest in a share of preferred stock 
of the relevant series:
a.
5.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD; 
b.
6.00% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE; 
c.
4.75 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series GG;
d.
4.55% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series JJ;
e.
4.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series LL; and
f.
4.20% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM.
We refer to the above six series of preferred stock herein collectively as the “Listed Preferred Stock”.
The Listed Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable. 
The terms of the depositary shares are summarized below under “Description of Depositary Shares”.
Ranking
The Listed Preferred Stock ranks, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or 
winding-up, on a parity with any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock and senior to 
our common stock and to any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock. The Listed Preferred 
Stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.
Dividend Rights
Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly 
authorized committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates described below under “Specific Terms 
of Listed Preferred Stock”. We will pay each dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register on 
record dates determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on the Listed 
Preferred Stock are noncumulative. If a dividend is not declared on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, because the 
dividends are noncumulative, then the right of holders of that series to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have 
no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend 
period.
We may not declare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, 
equally with or junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for 
payment, or we contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends on that series of Listed 
Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on a particular series 
of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that series, all 
dividends declared and paid upon the shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred 
stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the that series will be declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating 
the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, we will allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the 
then-current dividends due on shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of any series of non-cumulative 
preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and 
unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock and (ii) in the case of any series of cumulative preferred stock 
ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and 
unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock.
In addition, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Listed Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or a 
sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment in respect of the applicable most recently completed 
dividend period, with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock:
a.
 no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed 
Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum 
sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our 
common stock or upon any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or 
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, and
b.
no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally with that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends 
or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any 
consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of 
any such capital stock) by us, except:
i.
by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;
ii.
as a result of reclassification into capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;
iii.
through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of shares of capital stock 
ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock or, in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that 
Listed Preferred Stock, through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other 
shares of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;             
iv.
in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock, pursuant to pro rata offers 
to purchase all or a pro rata portion of the shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and such capital stock 
ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;
v.
in connection with the satisfaction of our obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary 
course prior to the beginning of the most recently completed dividend period; or
vi.
any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred 
Stock pursuant to any of our or our subsidiaries’ employee, consultant or director incentive or benefit 
plans or arrangements (including any employment, severance or consulting arrangements) adopted 
before or after the issuance of that Listed Preferred Stock).
However, the foregoing will not restrict our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to engage in underwriting, 
stabilization, market-making or similar transactions in our capital stock in the ordinary course of business. Subject to the 
conditions described above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be 
determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our 
common stock and any other capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock from time to time 
out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to 
participate in those dividends.
As used herein, “junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to our common stock and any other class 
or series of our capital stock over which the Listed Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or 
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; “parity preferred stock” and “on a parity 
with a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity 
with the shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or 
winding-up, or both, as the context may require; and “senior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to 
any class or series of our capital stock that ranks senior to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to 
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require.
We will compute the amount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number 
of dividend periods in a year, except that the amount of dividends payable for any period greater or less than a full 
dividend period, other than the initial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 
30-day months and, for any period less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts 
resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Rights Upon Liquidation 
In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series of Listed Preferred 
Stock will be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the 
amount of $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, 
before we make any distribution of assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares 
ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock of such series. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential 
amounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets.
If, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the amounts payable with 
respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, and any stock having the same rank as that series, the holders of 
that series and of that other stock will share ratably in any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full 
respective distributions to which they are entitled. For any series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the sale of all or 
substantially all of our property or business, nor our merger or consolidation into or with any other entity will be 
considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary of or involuntary, of us.
Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and our stockholders, including the holders 
of the Listed Preferred Stock, to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon that subsidiary’s liquidation, 
dissolution, winding-up or recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the 
extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.
Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are subordinate to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and 
our assets, including in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. In 
addition, holders of the Listed Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the 
event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.
Redemption 
We may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock on the dates and at the redemption prices set forth below under 
“Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. In addition, we may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock in whole, but 
not in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared 
and unpaid dividends, following the occurrence of a capital treatment event. For these purposes, “capital treatment event” 
means the good faith determination by JPMorganChase that, as a result of any:
a.
amendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or 
any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of 
any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock;
b.
proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of 
any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock; or
c.
official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement 
interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance 
of any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock,
there is more than an insubstantial risk that JPMorganChase will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full 
liquidation amount of all shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock then outstanding as “additional Tier 1 capital” (or 
its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, 
as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of such series of Listed Preferred Stock is outstanding. 
Redemption of any Listed Preferred Stock may be subject to our receipt of any required approvals from the Federal 
Reserve Board or any other regulatory authority.
If we elect to redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, we will provide notice by first class mail, postage 
prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed. Such mailing will be at least 30 days and not 
more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice so mailed will be conclusively presumed to have been 
duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in 
such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of the series designated for redemption will not affect the 
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of that series. Each notice of redemption will state:
a.
the redemption date;
b.
the number of shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held 
by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;
c.
the redemption price;
d.
the place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the 
redemption price; and
e.
that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the series of Listed Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository 
Trust Company, or “DTC”, we may give such notice in any manner permitted or required by DTC. For each series of Listed 
Preferred Stock, neither the holders of a series nor the holders of the related depositary shares have the right to require 
redemption of such series of Listed Preferred Stock.
In the case of any redemption of only part of the shares a series of Listed Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the 
shares of the series to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of that series in proportion 
to the number of shares held by such holders or by lot. From and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to 
accumulate on the shares of Listed Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date and all rights of the 
holders of those shares, except the right to receive the redemption price, will cease.
In the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, on any series of Listed 
Preferred Stock, we may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series, 
except by a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series.
Preemptive and Conversion Rights
The Listed Preferred Stock is not subject to any preemptive rights and is not convertible into property or shares of any 
other class or series of our capital stock. 
Depositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar
Computershare Inc. is the depositary, transfer agent and registrar for each series of the Listed Preferred Stock and the 
related depositary shares.
Voting Rights
Except as indicated below or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are 
not entitled to vote. Each share of Listed Preferred Stock a series is entitled to one vote on matters on which holders of 
that series are entitled to vote. The voting power of each series of Listed Preferred Stock depends on the number of 
shares in that series, and not on the aggregate liquidation preference or initial offering price of the shares of that series.
If, at any time or times, the equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, for any series 
of Listed Preferred Stock has not been paid, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be 
automatically increased by two and the holders of each outstanding series of Listed Preferred Stock with such voting 
rights, together with holders of such other shares of any other class or series of parity preferred stock outstanding at the 
time upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, which we refer to as “voting parity stock,” 
voting together as a class, will be entitled to elect those additional two directors, which we refer to as “preferred directors,” 
at that annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full dividends have been paid for at 
least four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that time such right will terminate, except as expressly provided in 
the applicable certificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of 
the Listed Preferred Stock and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the preferred 
directors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in office will terminate 
immediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected. Any 
preferred director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the 
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of the Listed Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with the holders of shares 
of voting parity stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy 
created by removal with or without cause may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any 
preferred director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining preferred director may choose a 
successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remains outstanding, we will not, without the 
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series and any voting parity stock, voting 
together as a class, authorize, create or issue any capital stock ranking senior to that series as to dividends or upon 
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock 
or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock. So 
long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative 
vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series, amend, alter or repeal any provision of the applicable 
certificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation, including by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to 
adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of that series.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special 
rights of any series of Listed Preferred Stock:
a.
any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock, or any increase or 
decrease in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the authorization, creation and issuance of 
other classes or series of capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to that series of Listed 
Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;
b.
a merger or consolidation of JPMorganChase with or into another entity in which the shares of that series remain 
outstanding; and
c.
a merger or consolidation of JPMorganChase with or into another entity in which the shares of the that series are 
converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly, 
controlling such surviving entity and such new preference securities have powers, preferences and special rights 
that are not materially less favorable than that series;
provided that if the amendment would adversely affect such series but not any other series of preferred stock 
outstanding, then the amendment will only need to be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the series 
of Listed Preferred Stock adversely affected.
In exercising the voting rights described above or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by us, each 
share of Listed Preferred Stock with respect to a series will be entitled to one vote (equivalent to 1/400
th of a vote per 
relevant depositary share).
If we redeem or call for redemption all outstanding shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock and irrevocably deposit in 
trust sufficient funds to effect such redemption, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would 
otherwise be required or upon which the holders of such series will be entitled to vote will be effected, the voting 
provisions described above will not apply.
Our board of directors may also from time to time, without notice to or consent of holders of a series of Listed Preferred 
Stock, issue additional shares of such series. Delaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right 
to vote separately as a class on any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of 
designations) that would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or 
decrease the par value of such class or adversely affect the powers, preferences and special rights of the shares of 
preferred stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as permitted by law, our certificate of incorporation provides that any 
increase or decrease in our authorized capital stock may be adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of capital stock 
representing not less than a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our capital stock 
entitled to vote. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one or 
more series of preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class of preferred stock, 
only the shares of the series so affected will be considered a separate class for purposes of this vote on the amendment. 
This right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in our certificate of incorporation (including any 
certificate of designations).
Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any series of our preferred stock become 
entitled to vote for the election of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be 
deemed a “class of voting securities.” In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a holder of 5% or more if that 
holder would also be considered to exercise a “controlling influence” over JPMorganChase, may then be subject to 
regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any other bank 
holding company may be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5% or 
more of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to provide notice to the 
Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.
Description of Depositary Shares
The following summary of the terms of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock is not 
complete. You should refer to each of the deposit agreements among us, the depositary, and the holders from time to time 
of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares relating to each series of the Listed Preferred Stock for the 
complete terms of those depositary shares. Each of those deposit agreements has been filed as an exhibit to a Current 
Report on Form 8-K filed in connection with the issuance of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed 
Preferred Stock.
General. Each depositary share represents a 1/400
th interest in a share of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, and 
is evidenced by depositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited 
shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement 
relating to that series of Listed Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of each deposit agreement, the depositary shares are 
entitled to all the powers, preferences and special rights of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, as applicable, in 
proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Listed Preferred Stock those depositary shares represent.
Dividends and Other Distributions. Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/400
th of 
the dividend declared and payable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock.
The depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred 
Stock to the holders of record of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by 
each holder. In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the 
holders of record of the depositary receipts as nearly as practicable in proportion to the number of depositary shares held 
by each holder, unless the depositary determines that this distribution is not feasible, in which case the depositary may, 
with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of the property and 
distribution of the net proceeds of that sale to the holders of the depositary receipts. 
Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the 
corresponding record dates for the related shares of Listed Preferred Stock. 
The amount paid as dividends or otherwise distributable by the depositary with respect to the depositary shares or the 
underlying Listed Preferred Stock will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on 
account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
Redemption of Depositary Shares. If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the 
corresponding depositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the 
redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be 
1/400
th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Listed Preferred Stock, plus any declared and 
unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends. 
If we redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same 
redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Listed Preferred Stock so redeemed. 
If we redeem less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary will select pro rata or by lot those 
depositary shares to be redeemed. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary 
receipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock 
and the related depositary shares. 
The redemption of depositary shares that are held in book-entry form through DTC will be effected in accordance with the 
applicable procedures of DTC. 
Voting the Listed Preferred Stock. Because each depositary share represents a 1/400
th interest in a share of Listed 
Preferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400
th of a vote per depositary share under those 
limited circumstances in which holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote. 
When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled 
to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares 
relating to that Listed Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the 
same date as the record date for the applicable Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of 
the Listed Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will 
vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it 
receives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as 
instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing 
the Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares.
Withdrawal of Listed Preferred Stock. Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary 
arrangement upon surrender of depositary receipts at the depositary’s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and 
fees provided for in the deposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of 
depositary receipts will receive the appropriate number of shares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such 
depositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn; if a holder holds an amount other than a 
whole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will deliver along with the withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred 
Stock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed 
Preferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive depositary shares.
Form and Notices. Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the 
depositary shares representing that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC. The 
depositary will forward to the holders of depositary shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are 
delivered to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock.
Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement. We and the depositary may amend any form of depositary 
receipt evidencing depositary shares and any provision of any deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary 
shares. However, any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares 
representing a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock or would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights 
granted to holders of that underlying Listed Preferred Stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation will not be 
effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the related depositary shares 
then outstanding. The deposit agreement relating to the depositary shares representing a particular series of Listed 
Preferred Stock may be terminated by us or by the depositary only if:
a.
all such outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed; or
b.
there has been a final distribution of the relevant underlying Listed Preferred Stock in connection with our 
liquidation, dissolution or winding up and the preferred stock has been distributed to the holders of depositary 
receipts.
Charges of Depositary. We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence 
of the depositary arrangements regarding any depositary shares. We also pay charges of the depositary in connection 
with the initial deposit of each series of Listed Preferred Stock and any redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock. Holders 
of depositary receipts will pay transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and other charges with respect to their 
depositary receipts as expressly provided in the deposit agreement.
Resignation and Removal of Depositary. With respect to the depositary shares representing each series of Listed 
Preferred Stock, the depositary may resign at any time by delivering a notice to us of its election to do so. We may remove 
the depositary at any time. Any such resignation or removal will take effect upon the appointment of a successor 
depositary and its acceptance of its appointment. We must appoint a successor depositary within 60 days after delivery of 
the notice of resignation or removal.
Miscellaneous. The depositary will forward to holders of applicable depositary receipts all reports and communications 
from us that we deliver to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the relevant Listed Preferred 
Stock.
Neither we nor the depositary will be liable if either of us is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our 
control in performing our respective obligations under any deposit agreement. Our obligations and those of the 
depositary will be limited to performing in good faith our respective duties under any deposit agreement. Neither we nor 
the depositary will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding relating to any depositary shares or Listed 
Preferred Stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished. We and the depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel 
or accountants, or upon information provided by persons presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of depositary 
receipts or other persons we believe to be competent, and on documents we believe to be genuine. 
Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock
5.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD
On September 21, 2018, we issued an aggregate of 169,625 shares of 5.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD, $1 
par value, with a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share (the “Series DD Preferred Stock”). Shares of the Series DD 
Preferred Stock are represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/400th interest in a share of preferred stock 
of the series.
Dividends. Dividends on the Series DD Preferred Stock are payable when, as, and if declared by our board of directors or a 
duly authorized committee of our board, at a rate of 5.75% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, on March 1, June 1,

DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC’S THE ALERIAN MLP INDEX ETNS DUE JANUARY 
28, 2044, FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.
The following description of Alerian MLP Index ETNs due January 28, 2044 (the “Alerian ETNs”) is a summary and does 
not purport to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February, 2016 
(as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial 
Company LLC, as issuer (“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorganChase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and 
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to 
the Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2016 Indenture for additional information.
General
The Alerian ETNs were originally issued on January 30, 2024 and are part of a series of JPMorgan Financial’s debt 
securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A Notes”) that JPMorgan Financial may issue under 
the 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series A Notes, please see the section titled “— 
Description of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC’s Callable Fixed Rate Notes Due June 10, 2032, Fully and 
Unconditionally Guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. — General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.  
The Alerian ETNs are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorganChase, the Guarantor. The Alerian ETNs will rank pari passu with all of JPMorgan 
Financial’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Alerian ETNs will 
rank pari passu with all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Alerian ETNs do 
not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or upon early redemption or repurchase.  Any payment on 
the Alerian ETNs is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the Alerian ETNs, and JPMorgan 
Chase & Co., as guarantor of the Alerian ETNs.
The Alerian ETNs are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other 
governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.
Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Alerian ETNs are registered on 
the books that JPMorgan Financial or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintains for this purpose, and 
not those who own beneficial interests in the Alerian ETNs (registered in street name or otherwise).
Key Terms of the Alerian ETNs
General
Principal Amount: $26 per Alerian ETN (equal to the Initial VWAP Level divided by ten, rounded to the nearest cent).
Index:  The return on the Alerian ETNs is linked to the performance of the Alerian MLP Index
® (Bloomberg ticker: AMZ), 
which we refer to as the Index, as measured by its VWAP level, and to cash distributions on its components. See “— Terms 
Relating to Closing Intrinsic Note Value — VWAP Level” below.  
The Index measures the composite performance of energy-oriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, that earn the 
majority of their cash flows from qualified activities involving energy commodities (the “Index Components”) using a 
capped, float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted methodology.  MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the 
exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural 
resource.  The Index is calculated and maintained by VettaFi LLC (“VettaFi”).  
Coupon Payments:  For each Alerian ETN a holder holds on a Coupon Record Date, the holder will receive on the 
immediately following Coupon Payment Date an amount in cash equal to the Coupon Amount, if any, as of the immediately 
preceding Coupon Valuation Date.
Coupon Amount:  The Coupon Amount as of any Coupon Valuation Date will equal:
a.
the Reference Distribution Amount with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, minus 
b.
the Accrued Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date,
provided that the Coupon Amount will not be less than $0.
If the Reference Distribution Amount on a Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Investor Fee on that Coupon 
Valuation Date, an amount equal to the excess of the Accrued Investor Fee over the Reference Distribution Amount (the 
“Investor Fee Shortfall”) will be included in the Accrued Investor Fee with respect to the next Coupon Valuation Date.
The Accrued Investor Fee will reduce each Coupon Amount. In addition, no Coupon Payment will be payable with respect 
to a Coupon Valuation Date if the Reference Distribution Amount is less than the Accrued Investor Fee, even if that 
Reference Distribution Amount is positive. The holders are not guaranteed any Coupon Payments.
The Coupon Amount is subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs as described under 
“— Split or Reverse Split of the Alerian ETNs” below.
Payment at Maturity:  For each Alerian ETN, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed, holders will receive at maturity a 
cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Final 
Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment at maturity will be $0.
Issuer Redemption:  On any Business Day on or after July 26, 2024, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the 
Alerian ETNs, in whole or in part. If the Issuer exercises its right to redeem the Alerian ETNs prior to maturity, for each 
Alerian ETN that is redeemed, holders will receive on the Redemption Settlement Date a cash payment equal to the 
Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Redemption Valuation Date. If 
that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early redemption will be $0.
Weekly Repurchase:  On a weekly basis, holders may request that we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs 
(subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs) if holders comply with the required 
procedures, subject to a repurchase fee of 0.125%. For each Alerian ETN that is repurchased, holders will receive on the 
relevant Repurchase Date a cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement 
Period with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date minus the Repurchase Fee Amount with respect to the Repurchase 
Valuation Date. 
If the amount calculated above is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early repurchase will be $0.
Terms Relating to Closing Intrinsic Note Value
Closing Intrinsic Note Value:  As of any date of determination, an amount per Alerian ETN equal to:
a.
the Principal Amount, multiplied by the Index Ratio as of that date, plus
b.
the Coupon Amount as of that date, calculated as if that date were a Coupon Valuation Date (the “Stub Coupon 
Amount”), minus
c.
any Investor Fee Shortfall determined in calculating that Stub Coupon Amount.
In addition, if the Coupon Ex-Date with respect to the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation 
Date has not yet occurred, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value will also include that Coupon Amount (an “Unpaid Coupon 
Amount”).
For purposes of determining the Closing Intrinsic Note Value over any Measurement Period, the Index Ratio is determined 
based on the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels over that Measurement Period, and the date of determination for 
purposes of determining the Coupon Amount, any Investor Fee Shortfall and any Unpaid Coupon Amount is the final day 
of that Measurement Period.
The Closing Intrinsic Note Value is not the closing price or any other trading price of the Alerian ETNs in the secondary 
market and is not intended as a price or quotation, or as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of the Alerian ETNs 
or as a recommendation to transact in the Alerian ETNs at the stated price. The trading price of the Alerian ETNs at any 
time may vary significantly from the Closing Intrinsic Note Value due to, among other things, imbalances of supply and 
demand (including as a result of any decision of ours to issue, stop issuing or resume issuing additional Alerian ETNs), lack 
of liquidity, transaction costs, credit considerations and bid-offer spreads.
If the Reference Distribution Amount used to calculate the Stub Coupon Amount on any Index Business Day is less than 
the Accrued Investor Fee used to calculate that Stub Coupon Amount, the resulting Investor Fee Shortfall will be deducted 
in calculating the Closing Intrinsic Note Value on that Index Business Day. Accordingly, the payment at maturity or upon 
early repurchase or redemption will be reduced by the amount of any Investor Fee Shortfall reflected in the relevant 
Closing Intrinsic Note Value.
Index Ratio:  As of any date of determination, the Index Ratio is equal to:
VWAP Level
Initial VWAP Level
provided that, solely for purposes of determining the Closing Intrinsic Note Value in connection with any payment at 
maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the Index Ratio determined over the relevant Measurement Period is 
equal to:
Final VWAP Level
Initial VWAP Level
Initial VWAP Level: 260.0267 which is the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels determined over a period of five Index 
Business Days ending on the Inception Date.
Final VWAP Level:  With respect to a Measurement Period, the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels on the five Index 
Business Days in that Measurement Period, as calculated by the Note Calculation Agent.
Measurement Period:  With respect to the Final Valuation Date or any Repurchase Valuation Date or Redemption 
Valuation Date, the five Index Business Days starting from and including the Final Valuation Date or that Repurchase 
Valuation Date or Redemption Valuation Date, as applicable (or, if that day is not an Index Business Day, the five Index 
Business Days immediately following that day). 
The Measurement Period is subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event and as described under “— 
Postponement of an Averaging Date.”
VWAP Level:  On any Index Business Day, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent, the sum of the products for each 
Index Component of:
a.
the VWAP of that Index Component as of that day; and 
b.
the Index Units of that Index Component as of that day, divided by the Index Divisor as of that day. 
The calculation of the VWAP Level may be modified in circumstances described under “— Postponement of an Averaging 
Date” and “— Discontinuation of an Index; Alternation of Method of Calculation” below. The official closing level of the 
Index may vary significantly from the VWAP Level.
VWAP:  With respect to each Index Component, as of any date of determination, the volume-weighted average price of 
one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent based on the Primary Exchange for 
that Index Component. 
Index Units:  With respect to each Index Component, as of any date of determination, the number of units of that Index 
Component included in the Index for purposes of the calculation of the official level of the Index by the Index Calculation 
Agent. 
Index Divisor:  As of any date of determination, the divisor used in the calculation of the official level of the Index by the 
Index Calculation Agent. 
Inception Date:  January 26, 2024
Initial Issue Date:  January 30, 2024
Final Valuation Date: January 20, 2044
Maturity Date: January 28, 2044. The Maturity Date is subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event 
and as described under “— Postponement of a Payment Date” below.
Terms Relating to Coupon Payments
Accrued Investor Fee:  The Accrued Investor Fee accrues at a rate of 0.85% per annum each day. In addition, the Accrued 
Investor Fee carries forward any shortfall if the Reference Distribution Amount determined in connection with any Coupon 
Payment is less than the Accrued Investor Fee at that time.  
With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, the Accrued Investor Fee is an amount equal to:
a.
the Periodic Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, plus
b.
the Investor Fee Shortfall, if any, as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date, if any.
Periodic Investor Fee:  With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, an amount equal to the product of
a.
the investor fee of 0.85% per annum; 
b.
the Principal Amount multiplied by the Index Ratio as of the immediately preceding Index Business Day that is not 
a Disrupted Day for any Index Component; and 
c.
the day count fraction, calculated using a 30/360 day count convention as described under “— Additional Terms 
— Day Count Fraction” below.
Reference Distribution Amount:  With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, an amount equal to the sum of the gross 
cash distributions that a Reference Holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of each Index Component held 
by that Reference Holder on the “record date” with respect to that Index Component, for those cash distributions whose 
“ex-dividend date” occurs during the Coupon Accrual Period for that Coupon Valuation Date. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to cash distributions for an Index Component that are scheduled to be paid 
prior to the applicable Coupon Ex-Date, if the issuer of that Index Component fails to pay the distribution to holders of that 
Index Component by the scheduled payment date for that distribution, that distribution will be assumed to be zero for the 
purposes of calculating the applicable Reference Distribution Amount.
Reference Holder:  As of any date of determination, a hypothetical holder of a number of shares of each Index Component 
equal to:
a.
the Index Units of that Index Component as of that date, divided by 
b.
the Index Divisor as of that date multiplied by 10,
provided that solely for purposes of determining the Reference Distribution Amount included in any Stub Coupon Amount 
payable at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the Reference Holder will be deemed to hold four-fifths, 
three-fifths, two-fifths and one-fifth of the shares of each Index Component it would otherwise hold on the second, third, 
fourth and fifth Index Business Days, respectively, in the relevant Measurement Period.
The Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference Distribution Amount and the Reference Holder are 
each subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs as described under “— Split or 
Reverse Split of the Alerian ETNs” below.
Coupon Accrual Period:  With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, the period from but excluding the immediately 
preceding Coupon Valuation Date (or, in the case of the first Coupon Valuation Date, from but excluding November 15, 
2023) to and including that Coupon Valuation Date. 
Coupon Valuation Date:  The first Index Business Day occurring on or after the 15th of February, May, August and 
November of each calendar year during the term of the Alerian ETNs, beginning on February 15, 2024.
Coupon Ex-Date:  With respect to a Coupon Amount, the first Exchange Business Day on which the Alerian ETNs trade 
without the right to receive that Coupon Amount. Under current NYSE Arca practice, the Coupon Ex-Date will generally be 
the first Exchange Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Coupon Record Date; however, beginning May 28, 
2024, under NYSE Arca practice, the Coupon Ex-Date is expected to generally be the applicable Coupon Record Date. For 
purposes of this paragraph, “Exchange Business Day” means any day on which the primary exchange or market for 
trading of the Alerian ETNs is scheduled to be open for trading.
Coupon Record Date:  The 9th Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date.
Coupon Payment Date:  The 15th Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date, subject to postponement in 
the event of a market disruption event as described under “— Postponement of a Payment Date” below.
Terms Relating to Issuer Redemption
Early Redemption:  On any Business Day on or after July 26, 2024, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Alerian 
ETNs, in whole or in part. If the Issuer exercises its right to redeem the Alerian ETNs, the Issuer will deliver an irrevocable 
redemption notice (the “Redemption Notice”) to DTC (the holder of the master note evidencing the Alerian ETNs) at least 
five Business Days prior to the Redemption Valuation Date specified in the Redemption Notice. If fewer than all the Alerian 
ETNs are to be redeemed, the Issuer will specify in the Redemption Notice the principal amount of the Alerian ETNs to be 
redeemed, and the Trustee will select the Alerian ETNs to be redeemed pro rata, by lot or in such manner as it deems 
appropriate and fair.
Payment upon Early Redemption:  If the Issuer exercises its right to redeem any Alerian ETNs prior to maturity, for each 
Alerian ETNs selected for redemption by the Trustee, holders will receive on the Redemption Settlement Date a cash 
payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the 
Redemption Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early redemption will be $0.
Redemption Valuation Date:  The date specified as the Redemption Valuation Date in the Redemption Notice. 
Redemption Settlement Date:  Unless otherwise specified in the Redemption Notice, the day that follows the final day in 
the Measurement Period with respect to the Redemption Valuation Date by a number of Business Days corresponding to 
the standard settlement cycle, which is currently two Business Days and which is expected to be one Business Day 
beginning May 28, 2024. In no event will the Redemption Notice specify a Redemption Settlement Date that follows the 
final day in the Measurement Period by more than five Business Days.
Terms Relating to Weekly Repurchase Right
Early Repurchase:  On a weekly basis, holders may request that we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs 
(subject to adjustment in the event of a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs) if holders comply with the procedures 
described under “— Repurchase Procedures” below and unless holders have delivered a Redemption Notice to DTC to 
redeem all of the outstanding notes. The Issuer may from time to time, in its sole discretion, reduce the minimum number 
of the Alerian ETNs required for an early repurchase on a consistent basis for all holders of the Alerian ETNs, but the Issuer 
is under no obligation to do so.
Payment upon Early Repurchase:  Subject to holders’ compliance with the required procedures, for each Alerian ETN that 
is repurchased, holders will receive on the relevant Repurchase Date a cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note 
Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date minus the Repurchase 
Fee Amount with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon 
early redemption will be $0.
Repurchase Fee Amount:  With respect to any Repurchase Valuation Date, an amount per Alerian ETN in cash equal to 
0.125% of the Closing Intrinsic Note Value with respect to that Repurchase Valuation Date (but excluding any Unpaid 
Coupon Amount included in that Closing Intrinsic Note Value). 
Repurchase Valuation Date:  The last Index Business Day of each week, generally Friday. 
Repurchase Date:  Unless otherwise specified in the Issuer’s acknowledgement, the day that follows the final day in the 
Measurement Period with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date by a number of Business Days corresponding to the 
standard settlement cycle, which is currently two Business Days and which is expected to be one Business Day beginning 
May 28, 2024. In no event will the Issuer’s acknowledgement specify a Repurchase Date that follows the final day in the 
Measurement Period by more than five Business Days.
Repurchase Notice:  A repurchase notice in the form specified by the Issuer. 
Repurchase Procedures:  In order to request that the Issuer repurchase a holder’s Alerian ETN, holders must instruct their 
broker or other person through which they hold Alerian ETNs to take the following steps:
a.
send a completed Repurchase Notice to the Issuer via email at ETN_Repurchase@jpmorgan.com by no later than 
4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation 
Date;
b.
instruct the holder’s DTC custodian to book a delivery versus payment trade with respect to that holder’s Alerian 
ETNs on the final day in the Measurement Period with respect to the relevant Repurchase Valuation Date at a 
price equal to the amount payable upon early repurchase of the Alerian ETNs; and
c.
cause the holder’s DTC custodian to deliver the trade as booked for settlement via DTC at or prior to 10:00 a.m., 
New York City time, on the relevant Repurchase Date.
Different brokerage firms may have different deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers. Accordingly, 
holders should consult the brokerage firm through which they own their interest in the Alerian ETNs in respect of those 
deadlines.
Once delivered, a Repurchase Notice may not be revoked. If the Issuer does not receive a holder’s Repurchase Notice by 
the deadline, such holder’s Repurchase Notice will not be effective. The Issuer or its affiliate must acknowledge receipt of 
the Repurchase Notice on the same Business Day for it to be effective, such acknowledgment will be deemed to evidence 
its acceptance of a holder’s repurchase request. The Note Calculation Agent will, in its sole discretion, resolve any 
questions that may arise as to the validity of a Repurchase Notice and the timing of receipt of a Repurchase Notice. 
Additional Terms
Business Day:  Any day other than a day on which the banking institutions in the City of New York are authorized or 
required by law, regulation or executive order to close or a day on which transactions in dollars are not conducted.
Index Business Day:  Any day on which the Primary Exchange and the Related Exchange with respect to each Index 
Component are scheduled to be open for trading.
Primary Exchange:  With respect to each Index Component, the primary exchange or market of trading of that Index 
Component.
Related Exchange:  With respect to each Index Component, each exchange or quotation system where trading has a 
material effect (as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) on the overall market for futures or options contracts 
relating to that Index Component.
Disrupted Day:  With respect to an Index Component, a day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange with 
respect to that Index Component fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a market 
disruption event (as described under “— Market Disruption Events”) with respect to that Index Component has occurred 
or is continuing, and, in each case, the occurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material 
effect on the VWAP Level.
Index Sponsor and Index Calculation Agent:  VettaFi
Note Calculation Agent, VWAP Calculation Agent and Published ETN Value Calculation Agent: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
(“JPMS”), one of our and JPMorgan Financial’s affiliates, will act as the Note Calculation Agent. Solactive AG will act as the 
VWAP Calculation Agent and the Published ETN Value Calculation Agent. We and JPMorgan Financial may appoint a 
different Note Calculation Agent, VWAP Calculation Agent or Published ETN Value Calculation Agent from time to time 
without holders’ consent and without notifying holders.
The Note Calculation Agent will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Alerian ETNs, 
including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Alerian ETNs and the assumptions used to 
determine the pricing of the Alerian ETNs, other than determinations to be made by the VWAP Calculation Agent. The 
VWAP Calculation Agent will determine the VWAP Level and the VWAP of each Index Component on each Index Business 
Day, except as described below under “— Postponement of an Averaging Date.” The Published ETN Value Calculation 
Agent is responsible for calculating the Daily Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value and the Interim 
Coupon or Shortfall Amount for purposes of publication.  All determinations made by the Note Calculation Agent, the 
VWAP Calculation Agent or the Published ETN Value Calculation Agent will be at the sole discretion of the Note 
Calculation Agent, the VWAP Calculation Agent or the Published ETN Value Calculation Agent, as applicable, and will, in 
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on holders, us and JPMorgan Financial.
The Note Calculation Agent will provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee 
may conclusively rely, of any amount payable on the Alerian ETNs at or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date 
on which payment is to be made.
All values with respect to calculations in connection with the Alerian ETNs will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-
thousandth, with five one-millionths rounded upward (e.g., 0.876545 would be rounded to 0.87655). Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, all dollar amounts related to determination of any payment on the Alerian ETNs per note will be rounded to the 
nearest ten-thousandth, with five one hundred-thousandths rounded upward (e.g., 0.76545 would be rounded up to 
0.7655), and all dollar amounts payable, if any, on the aggregate principal amount of Alerian ETNs per holder will be 
rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward.

Day Count Fraction: With respect to each Coupon Valuation Date, the day count fraction is calculated as follows:
where:
a.
“Y1” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that 
Coupon Valuation Date falls;
b.
“Y2” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day included in the 
Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;
c.
“M1” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Coupon Accrual Period with 
respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;
d.
“M2” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day included 
in the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;
e.
“D1” is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon 
Valuation Date, unless that number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and
f.
“D2” is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last day included in the Coupon 
Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, unless that number would be 31 and D1 is greater than 
29, in which case D2 will be 30.
Split or Reverse Split of the Alerian ETNs
The Issuer may initiate a split or reverse split of the Alerian ETNs at any time. The Issuer will determine the ratio of such 
split or reverse split, as applicable, using relevant market indicia in its sole discretion. If the Issuer decides to initiate a split 
or reverse split, as applicable, the Issuer will issue a notice to holders of the Alerian ETNs and a press release announcing 
the split or reverse split and the ratio and specifying the effective date of the split or reverse split, which will be at least 
three Business Days after the date on which the split or reverse split, as applicable, is announced, which we refer to as the 
“announcement date.” The record date for a share split or reverse split will be the Business Day immediately preceding the 
effective date. 
If the Alerian ETNs undergo a split or reverse split, the Issuer will adjust the terms of the Alerian ETNs as may be necessary 
or desirable to effectuate that split or reverse split, as applicable, including, without limitation, the Principal Amount, any 
Coupon Amount, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference 
Distribution Amount, the number of shares held by a Reference Holder and the minimum number of Alerian ETNs holders 
may request that the Issuer repurchase. For example, if the Alerian ETNs undergo a 4-for-1 split, each Alerian ETN holder 
who holds one Alerian ETN via DTC prior to the split will, after the split, hold four Alerian ETNs, and the Principal Amount, 
any Coupon Amount, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference 
Distribution Amount and the number of shares held by a Reference Holder will be adjusted as may be necessary or 
desirable to equal 1/4 of their respective values that would have prevailed in the absence of the 4-for-1 split. In addition, 
the minimum number of Alerian ETNs holders may request that the Issuer repurchase will be increased to equal 4 times 
its prior value. These adjustments may be applied retroactively for purposes of adjusting any Coupon Amount that has 
been determined but not yet paid.
In the case of a reverse split, holders who hold a number of Alerian ETNs that is not evenly divisible by the relevant ratio 
will receive the same treatment as all other holders for the maximum number of Alerian ETNs they hold that is evenly 
divisible by the relevant ratio, and the Issuer will have the right to compensate holders for their remaining or “partial” 
Alerian ETNs in a manner determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. The Issuer’s current intention is 
to provide holders with a cash payment for their partial Alerian ETNs in an amount equal to the appropriate percentage of 
the Closing Intrinsic Note Value (which may be calculated using an Index Ratio that reflects the average VWAP Level over 
a measurement period of five Index Business Days) on a specified Index Business Day no later than 20 Index Business 
Days following the announcement date, with payment to be made on a specified Business Day no later than five Business 
Days following the date on which the amount of the payment is determined.
Postponement of a Payment Date
In this section, we refer to each Coupon Payment Date and the Maturity Date as “Payment Dates.” If any scheduled 
Payment Date is not a Business Day, then that Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day following the 
scheduled Payment Date. If, due to a market disruption event or otherwise, any Averaging Date referenced in the 
determination of a payment on the Alerian ETNs that will or may be payable on any Payment Date is postponed so that it 
falls less than three Business Days prior to that scheduled Payment Date, that Payment Date will be the third Business Day 
following the latest such Averaging Date, as postponed. If any Payment Date is adjusted as the result of a non-Business 
Day, a market disruption event or otherwise, any amount payable on that Payment Date will be made on that Payment 
Date as postponed, with the same force and effect as if that Payment Date had not been postponed, but no interest will 
accrue or be payable as a result of the delayed payment.
Postponement of an Averaging Date
The Final VWAP Level used to determine the Closing Intrinsic Note Value in connection with any payment at maturity or 
upon early repurchase or redemption will reflect the arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels on the five Index Business 
Days in the relevant Measurement Period, and the VWAP Level on each Index Business Day is calculated by reference to 
the VWAP and the Index Units of each Index Component, as well as the Index Divisor. In this section, we refer to each of the 
five Index Business Days in a Measurement Period as an “Averaging Date.” As set forth below, if any Index Component is 
disrupted on any Averaging Date, determinations with respect to that Index Component for purposes of calculating the 
VWAP Level applicable to that Averaging Date will be postponed. In addition, determinations with respect to that 
disrupted Index Component for purposes of calculating the VWAP Level applicable to each following Averaging Date will 
also be postponed so as to avoid using the same VWAP of an Index Component on a given Index Business Day to calculate 
the VWAP Levels for more than one Averaging Date.
If any Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day for any Index Component, the VWAP Level on that Averaging Date will be 
deemed to be the Adjusted VWAP Level with respect to that Averaging Date, and that Averaging Date will be postponed 
to the earliest date on which that Adjusted VWAP Level can be calculated as set forth below. For the avoidance of doubt, 
no Averaging Date will be postponed to a date that is after the applicable Final Disrupted Averaging Date.
The “Adjusted VWAP Level” with respect to an Averaging Date that is an Unavailable Day for any Index Component will be 
determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent and will be calculated in accordance with the formula for calculating the 
VWAP Level, using: 
a.
with respect to each Index Component for which the originally scheduled Averaging Date is not an Unavailable 
Day, the VWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index Divisor, in each case as of the 
originally scheduled Averaging Date; and
b.
with respect to each Index Component for which the originally scheduled Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day, 
the VWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index Divisor, in each case, as of the first Index 
Business Day immediately following the originally scheduled Averaging Date that is not an Unavailable Day with 
respect to that Index Component, provided that, if each day from and including the originally scheduled 
Averaging Date to and including the applicable Final Disrupted Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day with respect 
to that Index Component, the VWAP of that Index Component will be determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent 
in good faith based on its assessment of the market value of that Index Component on that Final Disrupted 
Averaging Date and the Index Units of that Index Component and the Index Divisor will each be determined by the 
VWAP Calculation Agent based on its good faith estimate.
An Index Business Day will be an “Unavailable Day” with respect to an Index Component if it is a Disrupted Day for that 
Index Component or a day that is a Prior Valuation Date with respect to that Index Component and the relevant Averaging 
Date.
A “Disrupted Day” means, with respect to an Index Component, a day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related 
Exchange with respect to that Index Component fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a 
Market Disruption Event with respect to that Index Component has occurred or is continuing, and, in each case, the 
occurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material effect on the VWAP Level.
An Index Business Day will be a “Prior Valuation Date” with respect to an Index Component and an Averaging Date if the 
VWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index Divisor, in each case as of that Index Business Day, 
were used in calculating the Adjusted VWAP Level with respect to an earlier occurring originally scheduled Averaging 
Date within the same Measurement Period as that Averaging Date.
With respect to an Averaging Date, the “Final Disrupted Averaging Date” means the third Index Business Day after that 
Averaging Date, as originally scheduled.
Market Disruption Events
With respect to an Index Component, a “Market Disruption Event” means, the occurrence or existence of a condition 
specified below:
a.
any suspension, absence or limitation of trading in that Index Component on the Primary Exchange with respect 
to that Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the Primary 
Exchange or otherwise;
b.
any suspension, absence or limitation of trading in futures or options contracts related to that Index Component, if 
available, on any Related Exchange with respect to that Index Component, whether by reason of movements in 
price exceeding limits permitted by that Related Exchange or otherwise;
c.
any event that disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain 
market values for, that Index Component or futures or options contracts relating to that Index Component; or
d.
the closure on any Index Business Day of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange with respect to that 
Index Component prior to its Scheduled Closing Time unless the earlier closing time is announced by the Primary 
Exchange or that Related Exchange, as applicable, at least one hour prior to the earlier of (a) the actual closing 
time for the regular trading session on the Primary Exchange or that Related Exchange, as applicable, on that 
Index Business Day and (b) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the system for execution at the 
close of trading on that Index Business Day for the Primary Exchange or that Related Exchange, as applicable;
in each case determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion; and
a.
a determination by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion that the applicable event described above 
materially interfered with the Issuer’s ability or the ability of any of its affiliates to adjust or unwind all or a material 
portion of any hedge with respect to the Alerian ETNs.
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event with respect to an Index Component has occurred:
a.
a limitation on the hours or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from 
an announced change in the regular business hours of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange; and
b.
limitations pursuant to the rules of the Primary Exchange or any Relevant Exchange similar to NYSE Rule 80B (or 
any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any other self-regulatory organization or any 
government agency of scope similar to NYSE Rule 80B as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) on trading 
during significant market fluctuations will constitute a suspension, absence or material limitation of trading.
“Scheduled Closing Time” means, with respect to the Primary Exchange or the Related Exchange, on any Index Business 
Day, the scheduled weekday closing time of the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day, 
without regard to after hours or any other trading outside of the regular trading session hours.
Discontinuation of the Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation
If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of, or otherwise fails to publish, the Index, or if the Index Sponsor does not 
make the Index Components, their Index Units or the Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent, and the Index 
Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Note Calculation Agent determines, in its sole 
discretion, to be comparable to the discontinued Index and for which the index components, their Index Units and the 
index divisor, or equivalent information, is available to the VWAP Calculation Agent (such index being referred to in this 
section as a “successor index”), then the VWAP Level on any subsequent relevant date will be determined by reference to 
the VWAPs of the index components of that successor index, their Index Units and the index divisor of that successor 
index, or equivalent information, published with respect to that day and a fixed adjustment factor determined by the Note 
Calculation Agent upon the selection of that successor index to account for the difference in the levels of the Index and 
that successor index at that time for purposes of maintaining comparability between prior VWAP Levels and succeeding 
VWAP Levels.
Upon any selection by the Note Calculation Agent of a successor index, the Note Calculation Agent will cause written 
notice thereof to be promptly furnished to the Trustee, us, the Issuer and DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs.
Payment upon an Event of Default
In case an event of default with respect to the Alerian ETNs shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared 
due and payable per Alerian ETN upon any acceleration of the Alerian ETNs will be determined by the Note Calculation 
Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to the amount payable at maturity per Alerian ETN calculated as if the date of 
acceleration were (a) the final day of the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date and (b) the Final 
Disrupted Averaging Date for the final day of the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date (if the date 
of acceleration is a Disrupted Day). Under these circumstances, the Measurement Period with respect to the Final 
Valuation Date will consist of the date of acceleration and the four immediately preceding Index Business Days.
The amount determined as described above will constitute the final payment on the Alerian ETNs, and no additional 
amounts will accrue with respect to the Alerian ETNs following the date of acceleration.
If the maturity of the Alerian ETNs is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will 
cause the Note Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the 
Trustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs, of the cash amount due with respect to the 
Alerian ETNs as promptly as possible and in no event later than two Business Days after the date of acceleration.
Listing
The Alerian ETNs have been listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “AMJB.”  No assurance can be given as to 
the continued listing for the term of the Alerian ETNs, or the liquidity or trading market for the Alerian ETNs.  The Issuer is 
not required to maintain a listing on NYSE Arca or any other exchange.
Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company
DTC will act as securities depositary for the Alerian ETNs. The Issuer will issue Alerian ETNs only in fully registered form as 
book-entry notes. The Alerian ETNs will be represented by one or more permanent global notes deposited with, or on 
behalf of, DTC and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. These certificates name DTC or its nominee as the owner 
of the Alerian ETNs. DTC maintains a computerized system that will reflect the interests held by its participants in the 
global notes. An investor’s beneficial interest will be reflected in the records of DTC’s direct or indirect participants 
through an account maintained by the investor with its broker/dealer, bank, trust company or other representative. 
The Alerian ETNs will initially be represented by a type of global note referred to as a master note. A master note 
represents multiple securities that may be issued at different times and that may have different terms. Unless otherwise 
specified, in connection with each issuance of the Alerian ETNs, the Trustee and/or paying agent will, in accordance with 
instructions from the Issuer, make appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master note representing 
the Alerian ETNs to indicate that the master note evidences the Alerian ETNs of that issuance.
References to “holders” mean those who own Alerian ETNs registered in their own names, on the books that the Issuer or 
the paying agent maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in Alerian ETNs registered in street 
name or in Alerian ETNs issued in book-entry form through DTC.
Denominations
Book-entry interests in Alerian ETNs will be issued in minimum denominations equal to the Principal Amount and in 
integral multiples thereof.
Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent
Payment of amounts due at maturity on the Alerian ETNs will be payable and the transfer of the Alerian ETNs will be 
registrable at the principal corporate trust office of The Bank of New York Mellon in the City of New York.
The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Alerian ETNs. The Bank 
of New York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Alerian ETNs and may designate additional paying agents.
Registration of transfers of the Alerian ETNs will be effected without charge by or on behalf of The Bank of New York 
Mellon but upon payment (with the giving of such indemnity as The Bank of New York Mellon may require) in respect of 
any tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to it.
Reopening Issuances
In Issuer’s sole discretion, and without providing holders notice or obtaining their consent, the Issuer may decide to issue 
and sell additional Alerian ETNs from time to time. These further issuances, if any, will be consolidated to form a single 
class with the originally issued Alerian ETNs, will have the same CUSIP number and will trade interchangeably with the 
originally issued Alerian ETNs immediately upon settlement.
However, the Issuer is under no obligation to issue or sell additional Alerian ETNs at any time, and, if the Issuer does sell 
additional Alerian ETNs, the Issuer may limit or restrict those sales, and the Issuer may stop and subsequently resume 
selling additional Alerian ETNs at any time. If the Issuer limits, restricts or stops sales of such additional Alerian ETNs, or if 
the Issuer subsequently resumes sales of such additional Alerian ETNs, the liquidity and trading price of the Alerian ETNs 
in the secondary market could be materially and adversely affected. Unless the Issuer indicates otherwise, if the Issuer 
suspends selling additional Alerian ETNs, the Issuer reserves the right to resume selling additional Alerian ETNs at any 
time, which might result in the reduction or elimination of any premium in the trading price. If holders pay a premium for 
the Alerian ETNs above the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value, holders could incur 
significant losses if holders sell their Alerian ETNs at a time when the premium is no longer present in the market.
A suspension of additional issuances of the Alerian ETNs could result in a significant reduction in the number of 
outstanding Alerian ETNs if noteholders subsequently exercise their right to have the Alerian ETNs repurchased by the 
Issuer. Accordingly, the number of outstanding Alerian ETNs, and their liquidity, could vary substantially over the term of 
the Alerian ETNs.
The Alerian ETNs do not limit the Issuer’s ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other securities. Also, the Issuer is 
not subject to financial or similar restrictions by the terms of the Alerian ETNs. 
The Issuer has no obligation to take holders’ interests into account when deciding whether to issue additional Alerian 
ETNs. In addition, the Issuer is under no obligation to reopen any series of notes or to issue any additional Alerian ETNs.
General Terms of the Series A Notes
For a summary of the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the Series A Notes and guarantees issued thereunder, 
including provisions on events of defaults, modification of the 2016 Indenture and governing law, please see “— 
Description of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC’s Callable Fixed Rate Notes Due June 10, 2032, Fully and 
Unconditionally Guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. — General Terms of the Series A Notes” below. 
DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC’S CALLABLE FIXED RATE 
NOTES DUE JUNE 10, 2032, FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY JPMORGAN 
CHASE & CO.
The following description of the Callable Fixed Rate Notes due June 10, 2032 (the “Callable Notes”) is a summary and does 
not purport to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February 19, 
2016 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial 
Company LLC, as issuer (“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorganChase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and 
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to 
the Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2016 Indenture for additional information.
General
As of December 31, 2024, $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes were outstanding.
The Callable Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Callable Notes will rank pari passu with all of the Issuer’s 
other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Callable Notes will rank pari 
passu with all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  Any payment on the Callable 
Notes issued by JPMorgan Financial is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit 
risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the Callable Notes.
The Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the 
“Series A Notes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the 
Series A Notes, please see the section titled “— General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.
The Callable Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any 
other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.
Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Callable Notes are registered 
on the books that the Issuer or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not 
those who own beneficial interests in the Callable Notes (registered in street name or otherwise).
Key Terms of the Callable Notes
We issued the Callable Notes on June 10, 2021, in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 
thereafter.  The Maturity Date of the Callable Notes is June 10, 2032.  Interest on the Callable Notes is payable 
semiannually on June 10th and December 10th of each year, beginning on December 10, 2021 to and including the Maturity 
Date (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), subject to any earlier redemption, at the Interest Rate of 2.60% per annum. 
On June 10, 2031 (the “Redemption Date”), the Issuer may redeem the holders’ Callable Notes, in whole but not in part, at a 
price equal to the principal amount being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  Any accrued and unpaid 
interest on the Callable Notes redeemed will be paid to the person who is the holder of record on such Callable Notes at 
the close of business one (1) business day prior to the Redemption Date.  To redeem the Callable Notes, the Issuer will 
deliver notice to DTC, as holder of the Callable Notes, at least 5 business days and not more than 15 business days prior to 
the Redemption Date.
Calculation Agent 
JPMS (the “Calculation Agent”) will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Callable 
Notes, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Callable Notes.
Payment upon an Event of Default
In case an event of default with respect to the Callable Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared 
due and payable per $1,000 principal amount note upon any acceleration of the Callable Notes will be determined by the 
Calculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount note plus accrued and 
unpaid interest, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date.  In such case, interest will be calculated on 
the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days in such adjusted Interest Period and will be based on the 
Interest Rate on the applicable date immediately preceding such adjusted Interest Period.
If the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will 
cause the Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee 
may conclusively rely, and to DTC of the cash amount due with respect to the Callable Notes as promptly as possible and 
in no event later than two business days after the date of acceleration.
Listing
The Callable Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol “JPM/32.” No assurance can 
be given as to the continued listing for the term of the Callable Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the Callable 
Notes. 
Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company
DTC will act as securities depositary for the Callable Notes.  The Callable Notes have been issued only as fully registered 
securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, 
representing the total aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes, have been issued and have been deposited with 
DTC.  We will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.
Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent
The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Callable Notes.  The Bank 
of New York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Callable Notes and may designate additional paying agents.
Reopening Issuances
The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, “reopen” the Callable Notes based upon market conditions at that time.  These 
further issuances, if any, will be consolidated with, have the same CUSIP number as and trade interchangeably with the 
respective originally issued Callable Notes immediately upon settlement and, consequently, will increase the aggregate 
principal amount of such outstanding Callable Notes.  The price of any additional offering will be determined at the time of 
pricing of that offering.
General Terms of the Series A Notes
In this “General Terms of the Series A Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series A Notes issued 
by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC.
The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt 
securities, including the Callable Notes and the Alerian ETNs.
We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued 
under the 2016 Indenture.
These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2016 Indenture, which describes completely 
the terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued 
under it.  Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture.  Any 
reference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the 
entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.
The debt securities will be the Issuer’s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer’s other 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
The Guarantor is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank, National Association (the 
“Bank”), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), its “intermediate holding company.” The Guarantor 
conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including the Bank and the IHC. As a result, claims of the 
holders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of 
creditors of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries. Claims of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ creditors other than the Guarantor 
include substantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other liabilities. In addition, the Guarantor is 
obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds that the Guarantor receives from the issuance of 
securities (including the Alerian ETNs), and the ability of the Bank and the IHC to make payments to the Guarantor is 
limited. As a result of these arrangements, the Guarantor’s ability to make various payments is dependent on its receiving 
dividends from the Bank and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the 
Guarantor’s ability to pay interest on its debt securities, redeem or repurchase outstanding securities and fulfill its other 
payment obligations, including payment obligations under the guarantees of our debt securities.
Events of Default and Waivers
An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 
Indenture as:
a.
default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;
b.
default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at 
maturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;
c.
default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in 
the 2016 Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written 
notice has been given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in 
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor 
and the Trustee;
d.
certain events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or 
involuntary;
e.
the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the 
Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, provided that no Event of Default with respect 
to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the 
Guarantor or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a 
receiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 
2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, 
or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, 
receivership, winding up or liquidation; or
f.
any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of 
security. (Section 5.01)
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts 
payable on the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the 
Issuer, the guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable 
supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in 
aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice 
to the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest 
accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a default due to specified events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, 
insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities 
and any interest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee 
or any holder, become immediately due and payable.  Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and 
past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities 
of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)
Events of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not 
constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.  In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform 
any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any 
series of debt securities.  Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation 
relating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the 
debt securities to be declared due and payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against the 
Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.  Instead, even 
if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has 
occurred, the Trustee and the holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities 
to be immediately due and payable unless there is an Event of Default with respect to that series as described above, such 
as the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation or a payment default by the Issuer or the 
Guarantor on the relevant debt securities.  The value holders receive on any series of debt securities may be 
significantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the Issuer’s debt securities been declared due 
and payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor 
upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.
An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with 
respect to any other series of debt securities.  The 2016 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with 
respect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold 
notice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust 
committee of directors or Trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the 
interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a 
default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)
The 2016 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of 
each series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any 
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The 
Trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2016 
Indenture. (Section 5.09) The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2016 Indenture at 
the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity 
satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))
No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has 
previously given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders 
of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request 
upon the Trustee to institute such action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the 
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) 
have not given direction to the Trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)
However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that 
debt security or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be 
impaired or affected without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)
The 2016 Indenture requires the Issuer and the Guarantor to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to 
whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05) 
The Issuer, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank 
Trust Company Americas and The Bank of New York Mellon. If an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect 
to any debt securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act 
of 1939, as amended. In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2016 Indenture, and the Issuer would 
be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be 
an event of default if the requirements for giving the Issuer default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific 
period of time were disregarded.
Modification of the 2016 Indenture
The 2016 Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the 2016 Indenture 
or the rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected 
debt security must consent to a modification that would:
a.
extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt 
security;
b.
reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;
c.
change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2016 Indenture 
applicable to debt securities in foreign currencies;
d.
change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any 
debt security;
e.
reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;
f.
impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any 
right of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security;
g.
reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any 
modification; or
h.
make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of the debt securities of such series or 
release the Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Indenture. (Section 8.02)
The 2016 Indenture also permits the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to amend the 2016 Indenture in certain 
circumstances without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s merger or 
the replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, 
to make any change to the 2016 Indenture or the Issuer’s debt securities that the Issuer deems necessary or desirable and 
that does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. 
(Section 8.01)
Consolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets
Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or 
substantially all of their respective assets to any other entity, unless:
a.
with respect to the Issuer:
i.
either the Issuer is the continuing company in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor 
entity in the case of a merger or consolidation (including an affiliate of the Guarantor) or the entity to 
whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a 
United States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual 
payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the 
due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture 
binding upon the Issuer, and
ii.
no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of 
Default has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, 
conveyance or transfer, and
a.
with respect to the Guarantor:
i.
either the Guarantor is the continuing corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the 
successor corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the entity to whom those assets are 
sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation 
that expressly assumes the full and unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the 
principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual 
performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the 
Guarantor, and
ii.
no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of 
Default has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, 
conveyance or transfer. (Sections 9.01 and 9.02)
Any transfer of material assets of the Guarantor to any other entity that occurs as a result of, or because it is related 
directly or indirectly to, any proceedings relative to the Guarantor under Title 11 of the United States Code or under a 
receivership under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or under any other 
applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law will be deemed to be a sale, conveyance 
or transfer of all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets.
There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2016 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional 
protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor, a change of control of the 
Issuer or the Guarantor or a highly leveraged transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor.  The merger covenant 
described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction 
were structured to include a merger or consolidation of the Issuer or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all or 
substantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s assets.  However, the Issuer may provide specific protections, such as a 
put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which the Issuer would describe in the applicable prospectus 
supplement.
JPMorganChase Guarantee
The Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all 
other amounts payable under the debt securities when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon 
redemption, repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable debt securities or upon acceleration.  If for any 
reason the Issuer does not make any required payment in respect of the Issuer’s debt securities when due, the Guarantor 
will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by the 
Issuer under the 2016 Indenture.  The guarantee is of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01)
The Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be 
liable for any amount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually 
due and owing by the Issuer, and (2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely 
from, or on account of, the Issuer’s insolvency or the Issuer’s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency 
proceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to 
the Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer. (Section 14.02)
Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
We, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust 
Company Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.  The Bank of New 
York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of 
New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt 
securities issued under the 2016 Indenture.
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 
Indenture, to which JPMorganChase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which 
JPMorganChase acts as a guarantor, and the debt securities issued under JPMorganChase’s indenture.  
Governing Law and Judgments
The debt securities and the 2016 Indenture, including the guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance 
with, the laws of the State of New York. (Section 11.08)  
Exhibit 10.19
JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF JANUARY 21, 2025
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
Award Agreement
These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of January 21, 2025 (“Grant Date”) awarding 
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To 
the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with 
the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether 
written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in 
the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, 
effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same 
meaning as set forth in the Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase” and together with its 
subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each RSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date as 
set forth in your Award Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to motivate your future performance for services to be provided during the vesting period 
and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.
Dividend Equivalents
If dividends are paid on Common Stock while RSUs under this award are outstanding, you will be paid an amount equal to 
the dividend paid on one share of Common Stock, multiplied by the number of RSUs outstanding under this award as of 
the dividend record date.
Vesting Period
The period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” 
pursuant to which the Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to 
which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the 
Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--
Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of 
RSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, the section captioned 
“Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision).
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk 
RSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion 
that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following 
factors:
•
Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the 
priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory 
for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net 
income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute 
basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
•
For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at 
the Firm level is negative.
•
Awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period 
exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not 
meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
•
The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or 
“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the 
Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk 
RSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From 
Employment by a Government Entity”.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the 
Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In 
the case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.
Bonus Recoupment     
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment 
Policy (or successor policy) as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded 
to you for performance year 2024 and to this award.  You can access this policy as currently in effect by clicking the 
following link to the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Corporate Governance Principles web page and scrolling to the Bonus 
Recoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters”:
https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms and conditions in any way limits the rights of the Firm under the 
JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).
Termination of Employment
Except as explicitly set forth below under the subsections captioned “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--
Government Office” or “--Disability” or under the section captioned “Death”, any RSUs outstanding under this award will 
be cancelled effective on the date your employment with the Firm terminates for any reason.
Subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, 
“Bonus Recoupment”,  “Your Obligations” and “Remedies”), you will be eligible to continue to vest (as you otherwise would 
vest if you were still employed by JPMorgan Chase) with respect to your award in accordance with its terms and conditions 
following the termination of your employment if one of the following circumstances applies to you:
•

service with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date or if you are over 60 years of age with at 
least three years of continuous service with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date, and 
•
the sum of your age and Recognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination equaled or 
exceeded 60 and
•
you provided at least 180 days advance written notice to the Firm of your intention to voluntarily terminate 
your employment under this provision, during which notice period you provided such services as requested 
by the Firm in a cooperative and professional manner and you did not perform any services for any other

continued vesting shall be appropriate, which determination shall be made prior to your termination and will 
be based on your performance and conduct (before and after providing notice), and  
•
you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below, and
•
for 36 months from the date of grant of this award you do not either perform services in any capacity (such as 
an employee, contractor, consultant, advisor, or self-employed individual, whether paid or unpaid) for a 
Financial Services Company (as defined below) or work in your profession (whether or not for a Financial 
Services Company); provided that you may do one or more of the following:
◦
work in a government, education or Not-for-Profit Organization (as defined below),
◦
subject to disclosure and confirmation of the following, serve on the board of directors of a public or 
non-public company that is not a Financial Services Company.
After receipt of such advance written notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during 
such 180-day period as a condition to continued vesting or shorten the length of the 180-day period at the Firm’s sole 
discretion, but to a date no earlier than the date you would otherwise meet the age and service requirements.  
Additional advance notice requirements may apply for employees subject to notice period policies (see “Notice 
Period” below).
•
Government Office
In the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm to accept a Government Office or become a 
candidate for an elective Government Office, as described at the end of these terms and conditions under the section 
captioned “Government Office Requirements”.  See also definition of Government Office in the section captioned 
“Definitions”.
•
Disability 
In the event that 
•
your employment with the Firm terminates because (i) you are unable to return to work while you are receiving 
benefits under the JPMorgan Chase Long Term Disability Plan, or for non-U.S. employees, under the 
equivalent JPMorgan Chase sponsored local country plan (in either case, “LTD Plan”), or (ii) if you are not 
covered by a LTD Plan, you are unable to return to work due to a long-term disability that would qualify for 
benefits under the applicable LTD Plan, as determined by the Firm or a third-party designated by the Firm; 
provided that you (x) request in writing continued vesting due to such disability within 30 days of the date

notification), advise that you are seeking to be treated as an individual eligible for “Full Career Eligibility”, and 
receive written consent to such continued vesting,
•
with respect to “Full Career Eligibility” and “Government Office”, it is your responsibility to (i) notify the Firm within

(ii) take the appropriate steps to certify to the Firm prior to each vesting date while the employment restrictions

in all cases, complied with all other terms of the Award Agreement.  (See section captioned “Your Obligations”.)
Death
If you die while you are eligible to vest in RSUs under this award, the RSUs will immediately vest and will be distributed in 
shares of Common Stock (after applicable tax withholding) to your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock 
Administration Department, or if no beneficiary has been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not 
recognized locally, then to your estate unless otherwise required by local legislation.  Any shares will be distributed no 
later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death; 
however, our administrative practice is to register such shares in the name of your beneficiary or estate within 60 days of 
the Firm’s receipt of any required documentation.
Your Obligations
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree to comply with and be bound by the obligations set forth below next 
to the subsections captioned “--Confidentiality & Non-Solicitation”, “--False Statements”, “--Cooperation”, “--Compliance 
with Award Agreement” and “--Notice Period.”
•
Confidentiality & Non-Solicitation
During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your 
employment or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, 
you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written 
consent of the Director of Human Resources: (A) solicit, induce or encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees 
to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has received official, written 
notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (B) hire any employee or former employee 
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment 
terminated because his or her job was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated 
for more than six months, (C) to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to 
induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business with the Firm, any then current customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to you by virtue of 
your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service 
after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. 
These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, 
such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the 
Firm’s policies.
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone 
any Confidential Information (as defined herein) related to the Firm’s business or its customers except as explicitly 
permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. “Confidential 
Information” includes but is not limited to: (i) information received by the Firm from third parties under confidential 
conditions; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets, technical, product, business, financial, or development 
information from the Firm, the use or disclosure of which reasonably might be construed to be contrary to the interest 
of the Firm; or (iii) other proprietary information or data, including, but not limited to, customer lists.  In addition, 
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private 
and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  
For Employees with a Work Location in California, you agree that the restrictions in the first paragraph of this 
“Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation” provision shall not apply to you. However, you agree that, as a condition of 
receipt of this award, you will not, for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment 
or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, use 
“Confidential Information” in order to solicit or otherwise interfere in the relationship between the Firm and any current 
Firm customers, suppliers, or other persons or entities whose names become known to you by virtue of your 
employment with the Firm and in connection with your access to Confidential Information.
Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a 
regulator, a self-regulatory agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or 
concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding 
truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.
If you are required by law or requested to provide information to any private party, including the news media, related 
to your or anyone else’s employment with the Firm, you will, in advance of providing any response (to the extent 
lawfully permitted), and within five days of receiving any such legal demand or request, provide written notice to the 
Firm. Additionally, you agree to cooperate with the Firm in connection with the request for such information to the 
extent lawfully permitted.
•
False Statements
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make any untrue statements, such that they 
are made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, about the Firm, its 
employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group in verbal, written, electronic or any other form.  This shall not 
preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors regarding conduct you believe to be in violation of 
the law or from providing information to or cooperating with any government, regulator or law enforcement agency.
•
Cooperation 
You will cooperate with any Firm investigation, inquiry, or litigation, and provide full and accurate information to the 
Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter that relates to issues or events about which you may have knowledge 
or information, subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by 
you.  This Agreement does not restrict you from communicating with any federal, state, or local government, 
regulatory, or law enforcement agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be 
conducted by any such agency, including providing documents or other information without notice to the Firm.
•
Compliance with Award Agreement 
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award 
Agreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be 
affected thereby, including your prospective employer.
•
Notice Period 
If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or 
by policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice 
Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary 
advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.  
After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable 
Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, 
you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and 
professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and 
certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the 
length of the Notice Period. 
Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period 
described under the subsection captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment 
under that same subsection.
Remedies 
•
Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture 
In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus 
Recoupment”,  and “Termination of Employment”, up to 100% of your outstanding RSUs under this award may be 
cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
•
Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:
◦
you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational

responsible for the inaccuracy, or
◦
this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
◦
you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as 
reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business 
activities, or
◦

of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been

•
you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment

•
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by

you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.
To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to 
suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any 
period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or 
whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied.  JPMorgan Chase is not responsible 
for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated 
consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other 
Limitations”.
•
Recovery
In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the 
applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as 
follows:
•
Payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-
of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦
you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your 
employment, or
◦
you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”, or
◦
you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility” or “--
Government Office” following the termination of your employment.
•
In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to 
notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the 
detrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other 
Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.  
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring 
payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  
Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to 
provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  
For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection 
shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be 
under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.
For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  
However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to 
shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to 
pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made 
(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund 
or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in 
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery 
under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment”.
•
Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein 
will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a 
matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation 
of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in 
addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding Taxes: As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each 
distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any 
other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent 
authorities with respect to the vested shares, dividend equivalents and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) 
a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the 
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to 
the award, shares that vest under this award, and/or dividend equivalents, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this 
award or dividend equivalents until you pay any taxes associated with the award, vested shares and/or the dividend 
equivalents directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off: Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting 
date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including 
Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from 
any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account 
agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or 
unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any 
obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to 
accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry 
voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in 
accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its 
sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our 
stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You 
also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the 
period when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled 
in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Termination of Employment” 
and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such 
period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem 
appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of 
such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or 
receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such 
specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you 
may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting 
date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to 
Set Off” subsection above).  (See Sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment” and “Remedies”.)
Binding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger 
or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or 
continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason 
at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm 
to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining 
severance.
Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of 
shares and cash hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including 
these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified 
employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from 
service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred 
compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six 
months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first 
calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is 
not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the 
remainder of each calendar year immediately following (i) each applicable vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement 
shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award and (ii) each date that JPMorgan 
Chase specifies for payment of dividends declared on its Common Stock, shall be the payment date(s) for purposes of 
distributing dividend equivalent payments.  
Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any 
stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, 
combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common 
Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, 
in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan 
and to any RSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.
Interpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and 
administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this 
Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-
employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; 
and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the 
Committee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By 
way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be 
entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any 
time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under 
this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable 
to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and 
accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described 
above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code 
if it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human 
Resources of JPMorgan Chase.
Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any 
court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., 
as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary 
to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon 
receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or 
conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase RSUs, the Firm may 
accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before the required divestiture date; 
provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 
409A of the Code.  Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” 
section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution 
date prior to any acceleration event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned 
“Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding 
award that would continue to vest under that section.  In the case of a termination of employment where the award is 
outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall 
apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. 
Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your 
Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares 
had been distributed as scheduled as of each applicable vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations 
set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-
Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility”.
Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the 
purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on 
your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for 
compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your 
personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any 
time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you 
terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled.
Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, 
without regard to conflicts of law principles. 
Choice of Forum: By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise 
subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly 
in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to 
arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You 
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute 
and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims: By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection 
with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or 
arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a 
representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or 
joint action.
Litigation: By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the 
Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or 
any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its 
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not 
entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the 
event of such a suit by the Firm.
Non-transferability: Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of RSUs, nor your interests or rights in any such 
awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be 
transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.
Outstanding Awards: The Administrative provisions set forth above shall apply to any award of RSUs outstanding as of 
the date hereof, and such awards are hereby amended.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF JANUARY 21, 2025
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
Award Agreement
These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of January 21, 2025 (“Grant Date”) awarding 
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To 
the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with 
the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether 
written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in 
the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, 
effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same 
meaning as set forth in the Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase” and together with its 
subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each RSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date as 
set forth in your Award Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to motivate your future performance for services to be provided during the vesting period 
and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.
Dividend Equivalents
This award is not eligible for dividend equivalent payments.
Vesting Period
The period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” 
pursuant to which the Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to 
which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the 
Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--
Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of 
RSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, the section captioned 
“Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision).  
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk 
RSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion 
that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following 
factors:
•
Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the 
priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory 
for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net 
income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute 
basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
•
For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at 
the Firm level is negative.
•
Awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period 
exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not 
meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
•
The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or 
“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the 
Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk 
RSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From 
Employment by a Government Entity”.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the 
Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In 
the case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.
Holding Requirement
As of each vesting date, you shall be entitled to a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of RSUs vesting 
on such date, less the number being withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  You agree that the distribution made 
to you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, 
selling, pledging, or otherwise encumbering such distribution for a twelve-month period commencing with the vesting 
date.  Such restrictions shall lapse in event of your death.
Bonus Recoupment     
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment 
Policy (or successor policy) as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded 
to you for performance year 2024 and to this award.  You can access this policy as currently in effect by clicking the 
following link to the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Corporate Governance Principles web page and scrolling to the Bonus 
Recoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters”:
https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms and conditions in any way limits the rights of the Firm under the 
JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).

In consideration of grant of this award, and without prejudice to any other provision of this Award Agreement, you agree 
that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff (and any applicable 
supplement(s) to that policy) or successor policy as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive 
compensation awarded to you for performance year 2024 and to this award. You can access this policy as currently in 
effect in My Rewards through the following link:  https://myrewards.jpmorganchase.com
The provisions of the JPMorgan Chase EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff set out the terms and conditions 
applying to the grant of this award which ensure that the Firm is able to meet its regulatory obligations to operate malus 
(reduce) and/or clawback (recover) to awards in certain circumstances.  These include, but are not limited to, where (i) 
there is a material downturn in the Firm’s financial performance or (ii) where the Firm is required to hold more capital. The 
circumstances in which the events at (i) and (ii) would occur are analogous to some of the circumstances considered 
under the existing Firmwide terms and conditions, in particular the Bonus Recoupment Policy and the Protection Based 
Vesting provisions.  
Termination of Employment
Except as explicitly set forth below under the subsections captioned “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--
Government Office” or “--Disability” or under the section captioned “Death”, any RSUs outstanding under this award will 
be cancelled effective on the date your employment with the Firm terminates for any reason.
Subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, 
“Bonus Recoupment”,  “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”, “Your Obligations” and “Remedies”), you will 
be eligible to continue to vest (as you otherwise would vest if you were still employed by JPMorgan Chase) with respect to 
your award in accordance with its terms and conditions following the termination of your employment if one of the 
following circumstances applies to you:
•
Job Elimination 
In the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that
•
the Firm terminated your employment because your job was eliminated, and 
•
after you are notified that your job will be eliminated, you provided such services as requested by the Firm in a 
cooperative and professional manner, and
•
you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.
•
Full Career Eligibility 
In the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that
•
(i) you voluntarily terminated your employment with the Firm, and (ii) had completed at least five years of 
Recognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination with at least three years of continuous 
service with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date or if you are over 60 years of age with at 
least three years of continuous service with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date, and 
•
your Recognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination equaled or exceeded 15 years, or your 
combined Recognized Service with the Firm and external professional experience (as attested by you to the 
Firm) equaled or exceeded 30 years, and
•
you provided at least 180 days advance written notice to the Firm of your intention to voluntarily terminate 
your employment under this provision, during which notice period you provided such services as requested 
by the Firm in a cooperative and professional manner and you did not perform any services for any other 
employer, and 
•
continued vesting shall be appropriate, which determination shall be made prior to your termination and will 
be based on your performance and conduct (before and after providing notice), and
•
you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below, and
•
for 36 months from the date of grant of this award you do not either perform services in any capacity (such as 
an employee, contractor, consultant, advisor, or self-employed individual, whether paid or unpaid) for a 
Financial Services Company (as defined below) or work in your profession (whether or not for a Financial 
Services Company); provided that you may do one or more of the following:
◦
work in a government, education or Not-for-Profit Organization (as defined below),
◦
subject to disclosure and confirmation of the following, serve on the board of directors of a public or 
non-public company that is not a Financial Services Company.
After receipt of such advance written notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during 
such 180-day period as a condition to continued vesting or shorten the length of the 180-day period at the Firm’s sole 
discretion, but to a date no earlier than the date you would otherwise meet the service requirement.  
Additional advance notice requirements may apply for employees subject to notice period policies (see “Notice 
Period” below).
•
Government Office
In the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm to accept a Government Office or become a 
candidate for an elective Government Office, as described at the end of these terms and conditions under the section 
captioned “Government Office Requirements”.  See also definition of Government Office in the section captioned 
“Definitions”.
•
Disability 
In the event that 
•
your employment with the Firm terminates because (i) you are unable to return to work while you are receiving 
benefits under the JPMorgan Chase Long Term Disability Plan, or for non-U.S. employees, under the 
equivalent JPMorgan Chase sponsored local country plan (in either case, “LTD Plan”), or (ii) if you are not 
covered by a LTD Plan, you are unable to return to work due to a long-term disability that would qualify for 
benefits under the applicable LTD Plan, as determined by the Firm or a third party designated by the Firm; 
provided that you (x) request in writing continued vesting due to such disability within 30 days of the date 
your employment terminates, and (y) provide any requested supporting documentation and (z) receive the

notification), advise that you are seeking to be treated as an individual eligible for “Full Career Eligibility”, and 
receive written consent to such continued vesting,

employment restrictions applicable to you (as described herein) from your date of termination of employment 
through the applicable vesting date,
•
with respect to “Disability”, you must satisfy the notice and documentation described above and receive written 
consent to such continued vesting, and
•
in all cases, complied with all other terms of the Award Agreement.  (See section captioned “Your Obligations”.)
Death
If you die while you are eligible to vest in RSUs under this award, the RSUs will immediately vest and will be distributed in 
shares of Common Stock (after applicable tax withholding) to your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock 
Administration Department, or if no beneficiary has been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not 
recognized locally, then to your estate unless otherwise required by local legislation.  Any shares will be distributed no 
later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death; 
however, our administrative practice is to register such shares in the name of your beneficiary or estate within 60 days of 
the Firm’s receipt of any required documentation.
Your Obligations
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree to comply with and be bound by the obligations set forth below next 
to the subsections captioned “—Confidentiality & Non-Solicitation”, “—False Statements”, “--Cooperation”, “--Compliance 
with Award Agreement” and “--Notice Period.”
•
Confidentiality & Non-Solicitation 
During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your 
employment or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, 
you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written 
consent of the Director of Human Resources: (A) solicit, induce or encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees 
to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has received official, written 
notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (B) hire any employee or former employee 
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment 
terminated because his or her job was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated 
for more than six months, (C) to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to 
induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business with the Firm, any then current customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to you by virtue of 
your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service 
after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. 
These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, 
such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the 
Firm’s policies.
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone 
any Confidential Information (as defined herein) related to the Firm’s business or its customers except as explicitly 
permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process.  “Confidential 
Information” includes but is not limited to: (i) information received by the Firm from third parties under confidential 
conditions; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets, technical, product, business, financial, or development 
information from the Firm, the use or disclosure of which reasonably might be construed to be contrary to the interest 
of the Firm; or (iii) other proprietary information or data, including, but not limited to, customer lists.  In addition, 
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private 
and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means. 
For Employees with a Work Location in California, you agree that the restrictions in the first paragraph of this 
“Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation” provision shall not apply to you.  However, you agree that, as a condition of 
receipt of this award, you will not, for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment 
or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, use 
“Confidential Information” in order to solicit or otherwise interfere in the relationship between the Firm and any current 
Firm customers, suppliers, or other persons or entities whose names become known to you by virtue of your 
employment with the Firm and in connection with your access to Confidential Information.
Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a 
regulator, a self-regulatory agency, your attorneys, or a court conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or 
concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding 
truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.
If you are required by law or requested to provide information to any private party, including the news media, related 
to your or anyone else’s employment with the Firm, you will, in advance of providing any response (to the extent 
lawfully permitted), and within five days of receiving any such legal demand or request, provide written notice to the 
Firm. Additionally, you agree to cooperate with the Firm in connection with the request for such information to the 
extent lawfully permitted.
•
False Statements
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make any untrue statements, such that they 
are made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, about the Firm, its 
employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group in verbal, written, electronic or any other form.  This shall not 
preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors regarding conduct you believe to be in violation of 
the law or from providing information to or cooperating with any government, regulator or law enforcement agency.
•
Cooperation 
You will cooperate with any Firm investigation, inquiry, or litigation, and provide full and accurate information to the 
Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter that relates to issues or events about which you may have knowledge 
or information, subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by 
you. This Agreement does not restrict you from communicating with any federal, state, or local government, 
regulatory, or law enforcement agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be 
conducted by any such agency, including providing documents or other information without notice to the Firm.
•
Compliance with Award Agreement 
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award 
Agreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be 
affected thereby, including your prospective employer.
•
Notice Period 
If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or 
by policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice 
Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary 
advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.  
After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable 
Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, 
you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and 
professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and 
certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the 
length of the Notice Period. 
Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period 
described under the subsection captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment 
under that same subsection.
Remedies 
•
Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture 
In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus 
Recoupment”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff”, and “Termination of Employment”, up to 100% of 
your outstanding RSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
•
Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:
◦
you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational 
harm to the Firm or its business activities, or
◦
this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were 
responsible for the inaccuracy, or
◦
this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
◦
you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as 
reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business 
activities, or
◦
your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “Definitions” below) or, in the case 
of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been 
terminated for Cause. 
•
you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment 
restrictions applicable to your termination of employment, or
•
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by 
the specified deadline, or
•
you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.
To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to 
suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any 
period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or 
whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied.  JPMorgan Chase is not responsible 
for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated 
consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other 
Limitations”.
•
Recovery
In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the 
applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as 
follows:
•
Payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the three-year period prior to a notice-
of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦
you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your 
employment, or
◦
you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”, or
◦
you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility” or “--
Government Office” following the termination of your employment.
•
In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one-year period prior 
to notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of 
the detrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other 
Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.  
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring 
payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  
Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to 
provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  
For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection 
shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be 
under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.
For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  
However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to 
shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to 
pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made 
(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund 
or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in 
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery 
under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” and “EMEA Malus and Clawback 
Policy - Identified Staff”.
•
Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein 
will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a 
matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation 
of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”;  such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in 
addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding Taxes: As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each 
distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any 
other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent 
authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a 
number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by 
law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and 
shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated 
with the award and/or vested shares directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off: Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting 
date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including 
Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from 
any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account 
agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or 
unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any 
obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to 
accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry 
voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in 
accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its 
sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our 
stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You 
also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the 
period when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled 
in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback 
Policy - Identified Staff”, “Termination of Employment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--
Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such 
period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem 
appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of 
such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or 
receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such 
specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you 
may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting 
date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to 
Set Off” subsection above).  (See Sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment” and “Remedies”.)
Binding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger 
or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or 
continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason 
at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm 
to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining 
severance.
Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of 
shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these 
terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified 
employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from 
service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred 
compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six 
months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first 
calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is 
not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the 
remainder of each calendar year immediately following each applicable vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement 
shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award.  
Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any 
stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, 
combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common 
Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, 
in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan 
and to any RSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.
Interpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and 
administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this 
Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-
employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; 
and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the 
Committee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By 
way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be 
entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any 
time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under 
this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable 
to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and 
accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described 
above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code 
if it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human 
Resources of JPMorgan Chase.
Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any 
court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., 
as to length of service, time, geographical area, or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary 
to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon 
receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or 
conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase RSUs, the Firm may 
accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before the required divestiture date; 
provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 
409A of the Code.  Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” 
section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution 
date prior to any acceleration event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned 
“Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding 
award that would continue to vest under that section.  In the case of a termination of employment where the award is 
outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall 
apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. 
Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your 
Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares 
had been distributed as scheduled as of each applicable vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations 
set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-
Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility”.
Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the 
purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on 
your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for 
compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your 
personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any 
time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you 
terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled.
Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, 
without regard to conflicts of law principles. 
Choice of Forum: By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise 
subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly 
in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to 
arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You 
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute 
and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims: By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection 
with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or 
arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a 
representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or 
joint action.
Litigation: By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the 
Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or 
any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its 
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not

(“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) 
conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other 
agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline 
and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, 
effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same 
meaning as set forth in the Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its 
subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the vesting date as set forth in 
your Award Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those 
of the Firm and its shareholders.
Number to Vest on the Vesting Date
Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:
Performance calculation:  On the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you will vest in a number of PSUs 
derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance 
Table.  See sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”.
You will also vest in additional shares of Common Stock as calculated under the section captioned, “Reinvested Dividend 
Equivalent Share Units”.  Delivery of vested shares to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last 
sentence of the subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.
Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units
If dividends are paid on Common Stock during the Vesting Period while the award is outstanding, you will receive on the 
vesting date additional units representing shares of Common Stock as calculated in this section.  The number, if any, will 
be based on the dividends that would have been paid during the Vesting Period as of each dividend payment date on the 
actual number of shares of Common Stock distributable to you resulting from the vesting of the PSUs, if any, and treated 
as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock on each dividend payment based on the Fair Market Value of one 
share of Common Stock on each dividend payment date (“Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”).
Holding Requirement 
As of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you shall be entitled to be issued a number of shares of the 
Common Stock of JPMorgan Chase equal to the number of PSUs, if any, plus any additional Reinvested Dividend 
Equivalent Share Units, vesting on such date, less the number withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  The net 
number of shares issued to you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, 
assigning, hedging, selling, pledging, or otherwise encumbering such shares for a two-year period commencing as of the 
vesting date and ending as of the second anniversary of the vesting date.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the 
expiration of the two-year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict 
reasons.  See section captioned, “Death” and subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict 
Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF __________________, 20___
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
 (Protection-Based Vesting Provisions)
Calculation of Performance Ranking 
For purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance 
Period shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common 
Equity” (if otherwise applicable), “Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” and “ROTCE” as set 
forth in the “Definitions” section of these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “Definitions”.  Except for Firm’s 
externally published Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy%), 
rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “Definitions--Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All 
performance-based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.
Capital Ratio Performance Threshold 
Unvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below 
a predetermined threshold of _______%.
If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to 
one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the Compensation & 
Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”) for each such year.
Vesting Period 
The period from the Grant Date to the vesting date is the “Vesting Period”. (See “Administrative Provision--Amendment” 
pursuant to which the Firm may extend the vesting period and “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to 
which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares of Common Stock following the vesting date and section 
captioned, “Holding Period” above.)
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date, provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm 
through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job 
Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of PSUs 
that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Number to Vest 
on the Vesting Date”, “Capital Ratio Performance Threshold”, “Remedies”, and the following protection-based vesting 
provision).  
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award (including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units) that 
would otherwise be distributable to you on the vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive 
Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk 
PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:
•
Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for 
which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained 
period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are:  net income, total net revenue, 
earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
•
For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the 
Firm level is negative.
•
RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, 
direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual 
Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
•
The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold. 
For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur 
prior to the end of the Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the 
end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty percent of the Target Award Number.  
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, “Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or 
“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the 
Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Committee.  
In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified 
by the Board.

Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary 
advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.  
After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable 
Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, 
you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and 
professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and 
certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the 
length of the Notice Period. 
Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period 
described under the subsection captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment 
under that same subsection.
Remedies
•
Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture 
In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus 
Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation” and “Termination of Employment”, 
up to 100% of your outstanding PSUs under this award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated 
Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole 
discretion determines that:
•
Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:
◦you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm 
to the Firm or its business activities, or
◦this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible 
for the inaccuracy, or
◦this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
◦you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as 
reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business 
activities, or
◦your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “Definitions” below) or, in the case of a 
determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated 
for Cause.
•
you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions 
applicable to your termination of employment, or
•
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by the 
specified deadline, or
•
you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.
To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to 
suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any 
period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or 
whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied.  The Firm is not responsible for any 
price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent 
with Plan administration procedures.  See also “Administrative Provisions—No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.
In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the 
applicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares previously distributed, including vested 
shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:
•
Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three-year period 
prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦
you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; 
◦
you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations;” or
◦
you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government 
Office” following the termination of your employment.
•
In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to 
notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the 
detrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other 
Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring 
payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  
Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to 
provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  
For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection 
shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be 
under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.
For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  
However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to 
shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to 
pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made 
(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund 
or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in 
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery 
under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” or “Recovery of Erroneously 
Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation”.
•
Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein 
will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a 
matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation 
of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in 
addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.  
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each 
distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any 
other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent 
authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a 
number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by 
law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and 
shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated 
with the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting 
date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including 
Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from 
any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account 
agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or 
unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any 
obligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not 
apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry 
voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if 
any, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By 
accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your 
name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that 
account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the 
cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been 
suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based 
Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation”, “Termination of 
Employment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “—Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such 
period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem 
appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of 
such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or 
receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such 
specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you 
may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting 
date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to 
Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-
Based Compensation” and “Remedies”.)   
Binding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger 
or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or 
continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason 
at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm 
to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining 
severance.
Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of 
shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these 
terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified 
employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from 
service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred 
compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six 
months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first 
calendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is 
not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the 
remainder of each calendar year immediately following the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a 
payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award. 
Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any 
stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, 
combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common 
Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, 
in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan 
and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. 
Other Equitable Adjustments: The Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as it deems to be 
equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual 
or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case 
resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or 
regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate.
Interpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and 
administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this 
Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-
employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; 
and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the 
Committee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By 
way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be 
entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any 
time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under 
this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable 
to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and 
accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described 
above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code 
if it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human 
Resources of JPMorgan Chase.
Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any 
court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., 
as to length of service, time, geographical area, or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary 
to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.  
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon 
receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or 
conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may 
accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, including Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, 
effective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated 
distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated 
distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period 
for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration 
event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned 
“Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding 
award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is 
outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall 
apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of 
Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section 
captioned “Death”. 
To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to 
divestiture requirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.
Notwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will 
remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the 
duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of the vesting date, including, but 
not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the 
sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “Full Career 
Eligibility”. 
Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the 
purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on 
your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for 
compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your 
personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any 
time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you 
terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled. 
Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, 
without regard to conflicts of law principles. 
Choice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise 
subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly 
in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to 
arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You 
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute 
and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum. 
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection 
with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or 
arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a 
representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or 
joint action.
Litigation:  By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the 
Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or 
any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its 
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding.  In addition, you agree that you are not 
entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the 
event of such a suit by the Firm. 
Non-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance-
based share units, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, 
hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a 
beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.

If your service in a Government Office ends two years or more after your employment with the Firm terminates, or in the 
case of resignation from the Firm to campaign for a Government Office, your name is on the primary or final public ballot 
for the election and you are not elected, any CV Awards then outstanding and any such awards that would have then been 
outstanding but for an accelerated distribution of shares (as described in the subsection captioned “--Accelerated 
Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”) will be subject for the 
remainder of the applicable vesting period to the same terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, including 
employment restrictions during the vesting period, as if you had resigned from the Firm having met the  requirements for 
Full Career Eligibility. 
Failure to Satisfy Conditions:
If you do not satisfy the above “Conditions for Continued Vesting of Awards”, any outstanding PSUs under the CV Award 
will be cancelled. You also will be required to repay the Fair Market Value of the number of shares (before tax and other 
withholdings) of Common Stock distributed to you that would have been outstanding as PSUs on the date you failed to 
satisfy the “Conditions for Continued Vesting of Award” but for their accelerated distribution (as described in subsection 
captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”). 
Fair Market Value for this purpose will be determined as the date that the shares were distributed.
JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF __________________, 20___
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
 (Protection-Based Vesting Provisions)
Award Agreement
These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of _____________________ (“Grant Date”) 
awarding performance share units (“PSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) 
conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other 
agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline 
and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, 
effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same 
meaning as set forth in the Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its 
subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock following each vesting date as set 
forth in your Award Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those 
of the Firm and its shareholders.
Number of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period
Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:
Performance calculation:  The number of PSUs at the end of the Performance Period will be derived by multiplying the 
Target Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.  
The number of PSUs determined above will be subject to the Qualitative Performance Factor (as detailed below), which if 
the Committee determines that such an adjustment is appropriate, will be applied following the end of each year during 
the Performance Period, to adjust downward one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each calendar year in the 
Performance Period.  Additionally, the Committee, in its discretion, may make a qualitative performance assessment 
based on the entire three-year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of 
PSUs determined above.
See sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”.
Delivery of vested shares of common stock to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last 
sentence of the subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.
Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units
This award is not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent share units.
Holding Requirement 
The net number of shares of Common Stock (after tax and all other lawful withholdings) in which you have vested, if any, as 
of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing 
you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for (i) a twelve month 
period measured from each vesting date; and (ii) a two-year period for such shares vesting on ________________, with the 
holding periods running concurrently.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two-year holding 
period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, 
“Death” and subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by 
a Government Entity”.
Calculation of Performance Ranking
For purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance 
Period shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common 
Equity” (if otherwise applicable), “Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” and “ROTCE” as set 
forth in the “Definitions” section of these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “Definitions”.  Except for Firm’s 
externally published Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy%), 
rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “Definitions--Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All 
performance-based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.
Capital Ratio Performance Threshold 
Unvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below 
a predetermined threshold of ______%.
If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to 
one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the Compensation & 
Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”) for each such year.
Qualitative Performance 
Determination of Qualitative Performance Factor.  Annually during the Performance Period, the Committee will formally 
assess your qualitative performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls & 
Conduct; (3) Teamwork & Leadership; and (4) Business Results. If the Committee determines that your performance 
“Meets” expectations, no downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for that year shall take 
place (and the Qualitative Performance Factor shall be 100%). If the Committee determines that your performance did 
“Not Meet” expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what 
extent.  A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0% and 99%, depending on 
the circumstances.  During the Performance Period, a 0% Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period 
would reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to zero, resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting. 
Additionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on 
your performance during the entire three-year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the 
entire number of PSUs determined under section captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at the end of the 
Performance Period”.  In the case of a Qualitative Performance Factor of 0%, the award would be cancelled.
The assessment will have regard to feedback solicited from the Chair of the UK Remuneration Committee to incorporate 
qualitative performance against local regulatory responsibilities as a “Senior Manager” of the relevant UK-regulated 
entities.
The Qualitative Performance Factor shall only be applied, if applicable, in respect of a period of your employment with the 
Firm, or as soon as administratively practical.
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, provided that you 
are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting 
described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  
However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not 
limited to, sections captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period”, “Capital Ratio 
Performance Threshold”, “Remedies”, and the following protection-based vesting provision).  
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you as of any vesting date (“At Risk 
PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion 
that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following 
factors:
•
Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for 
which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained 
period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are:  net income, total net revenue, 
earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
•
For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the 
Firm level is negative.
•
RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, 
direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual 
Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
•
The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold. 
For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur 
prior to the end of the Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the 
end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty percent of the Target Award Number.  
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, “Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or 
“Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the 
Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Committee.  
In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified 
by the Board.

designation is not recognized locally) may be entitled to receive a distribution of a number of shares of Common Stock 
associated with your award. 
Should you die after the end of the Performance Period, your beneficiary will receive shares of Common Stock equal to any 
outstanding PSUs.

average performance of all completed calendar years, multiplied by one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for

•
Confidentiality & Non-Solicitation
During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your 
employment or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, 
you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written 
consent of the Director of Human Resources: (A) solicit, induce or encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees 
to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has received official, written 
notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (B) hire any employee or former employee 
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment 
terminated because his or her job was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated 
for more than six months, (C) to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to 
induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business with the Firm, any then current customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to you by virtue of 
your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service 
after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. 
These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, 
such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the 
Firm’s policies.
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone 
any Confidential Information (as defined herein) related to the Firm’s business or its customers except as explicitly 
permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. “Confidential 
Information” includes but is not limited to: (i) information received by the Firm from third parties under confidential 
conditions; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets, technical, product, business, financial, or development 
information from the Firm, the use or disclosure of which reasonably might be construed to be contrary to the interest

following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private 
and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  . 
For Employees with a Work location in California, you agree that the restrictions in the first paragraph of the 
“Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation” provision shall not apply to you.  However, you agree that, as a condition of 
receipt of this award, you will not, for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment 
or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, use 
“Confidential Information” in order to solicit or otherwise interfere in the relationship between the Firm and any current 
Firm customers, suppliers, or other persons or entities whose names become known to you by virtue of your 
employment with the Firm and in connection with your access to Confidential Information.
Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a 
regulator, a self-regulatory agency, your attorneys, or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or 
concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding 
truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.
If you are required by law or requested to provide information to any private party, including the news media, related 
to your or anyone else’s employment with the Firm, you will, in advance of providing any response (to the extent 
lawfully permitted), and within five days of receiving any such legal demand or request, provide written notice to the 
Firm. Additionally, you agree to cooperate with the Firm in connection with the request for such information to the 
extent lawfully permitted.
•
False Statements
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make any untrue statements, such that they 
are made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, about the Firm, its 
employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group in verbal, written, electronic or any other form.  This shall not 
preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors regarding conduct you believe to be in violation of 
the law or from providing information to or cooperating with any government, regulator or law enforcement agency.
•
Cooperation 
You will cooperate with any Firm investigation, inquiry, or litigation, and provide full and accurate information to the 
Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter that relates to issues or events about which you may have knowledge 
or information, subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by 
you.  This Agreement does not restrict you from communicating with any federal, state, or local government, 
regulatory, or law enforcement agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be 
conducted by any such agency, including providing documents or other information without notice to the Firm.
•
Compliance with Award Agreement 
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award 
Agreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be 
affected thereby, including your prospective employer.
•
Notice Period 
If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or 
by policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice 
Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary 
advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.  
After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable 
Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, 
you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and 
professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and 
certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the 
length of the Notice Period. 
Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period 
described under the subsection captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment 
under that same subsection.
Remedies
•
Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture 
In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, 
“Qualitative Performance Factor”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based 
Compensation”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”  and “Termination of Employment”, up to 100% 
of your outstanding PSUs under this award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated Reinvested Dividend 
Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines 
that:
•
Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:
◦you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm 
to the Firm or its business activities, or
◦this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible 
for the inaccuracy, or
◦this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
◦you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as 
reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business 
activities, or
◦your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “Definitions” below) or, in the case of a 
determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated 
for Cause.
•
you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions 
applicable to your termination of employment, or
•
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by the 
specified deadline, or
•
you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.
To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to 
suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any 
period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or 
whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied.  The Firm is not responsible for any 
price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent 
with Plan administration procedures.  See also “Administrative Provisions—No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.
In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the 
applicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, 
including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:
•
Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three-year period 
prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦
you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; 
◦
you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”; or
◦
you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government 
Office” following the termination of your employment.
•
In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one-year period prior to 
notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the 
detrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other 
Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring 
payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  
Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to 
provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  
For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection 
shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be 
under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.
For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  
However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to 
shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to 
pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made 
(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund 
or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in 
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery 
under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously 
Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation” or “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”.
•
Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein 
will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a 
matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation 
of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in 
addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.  
Administrative Provisions
Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each 
distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any 
other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent 
authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a 
number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by 
law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and 
shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated 
with the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting 
date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including 
Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from 
any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account 
agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or 
unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any 
obligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not 
apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry 
voting rights.  No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if 
any, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By 
accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your 
name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that 
account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the 
cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been 
suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based 
Vesting”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based 
Compensation”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”, “Termination of Employment” and “Remedies”, as 
well as the subsection captioned “—Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such 
period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem 
appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of 
such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or 
receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such 
specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you 
may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting 
date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to 
Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-
Based Compensation” and “Remedies”.)   
Binding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger 
or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or 
continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason 
at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm 
to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining 
severance.
Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of 
shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these 
terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified 
employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from 
service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred 
compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six 
months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first 
calendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is 
not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the 
remainder of each calendar year immediately following each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a 
payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award. 
Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any 
stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, 
combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common 
Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, 
in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan 
and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. 
Other Equitable Adjustments: Except for the “Qualitative Performance Factor”, the Committee may make adjustments 
(up or down) to the award as it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed 
circumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or 
its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in 
capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee 
may deem appropriate.
Interpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and 
administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this 
Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-
employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; 
and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the 
Committee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By 
way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be 
entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any 
time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under 
this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable 
to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and 
accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described 
above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code 
if it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human 
Resources of JPMorgan Chase. 
Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any 
court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., 
as to length of service, time, geographical area, or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary 
to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.  
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity:  Upon 
receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or 
conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may 
accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, effective on or before the required divestiture date and 
waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such 
acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the 
dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally 
scheduled vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned 
“Government Office Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding 
award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is 
outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall 
apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of 
Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section 
captioned “Death”. 
To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to 
divestiture requirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.
Notwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will 
remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the 
duration of the vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each vesting date, including, but not 
limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the 
sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection “Full Career 
Eligibility”. 
Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the 
purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on 
your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for 
compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your 
personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any 
time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you 
terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled. 
Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, 
without regard to conflicts of law principles. 
Choice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise 
subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly 
in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to 
arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You 
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute 
and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum. 
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection 
with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or 
arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a 
representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or 
joint action.
Litigation:  By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the 
Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or 
any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its 
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding.  In addition, you agree that you are not 
entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the 
event of such a suit by the Firm. 
Non-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance-
based share units, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, 
hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a 
beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.

terminated because his or her job was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated 
for more than six months, (C) to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to 
induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business with the Firm, any then current customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to you by virtue of 
your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, 
suppliers or other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service 
after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.
These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, 
such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the 
Firm’s policies.
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone 
any Confidential Information (as defined herein) related to the Firm’s business or its customers, except as explicitly 
permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process.  “Confidential 
Information” includes but is not limited to: (i) information received by the Firm from third parties under confidential 
conditions; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets, technical, product, business, financial, or development 
information from the Firm, the use or disclosure of which reasonably might be construed to be contrary to the interest 
of the Firm; or (iii) other proprietary information or data, including, but not limited to, customer lists. In addition, 
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private 
and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  
For Employees with a Work Location in California, you agree that the restrictions in the first paragraph of this 
“Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation” provision shall not apply to you. However, you agree that, as a condition of 
receipt of this award, you will not, for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment 
or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, use 
“Confidential Information” in order to solicit or otherwise interfere in the relationship between the Firm and any current 
Firm customers, suppliers, or other persons or entities whose names become known to you by virtue of your 
employment with the Firm and in connection with your access to Confidential Information.
Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a 
regulator, a self-regulatory agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or 
concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding 
truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.
If you are required by law or requested to provide information to any private party, including the news media, related 
to your or anyone else’s employment with the Firm, you will, in advance of providing any response (to the extent 
lawfully permitted), and within five days of receiving any such legal demand or request, provide written notice to the 
Firm. Additionally, you agree to cooperate with the Firm in connection with the request for such information to the 
extent lawfully permitted.
•
False Statements
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make any untrue statements, such that they 
are made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, about the Firm, its 
employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group in verbal, written, electronic or any other form.  This shall not 
preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors regarding conduct you believe to be in violation of 
the law or preclude you from providing information to or cooperating with any government, regulator or law 
enforcement agency.
•
Cooperation
You will cooperate with any Firm investigation, inquiry, or litigation, and provide full and accurate information to the 
Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter that relates to issues or events about which you may have knowledge 
or information, subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by 
you. This Agreement does not restrict you from communicating with any federal, state, or local government, 
regulatory, or law enforcement agency or otherwise participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be 
conducted by any such agency, including providing documents or other information without notice to the Firm.
•
Compliance with Award Agreement 
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award 
Agreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third-party who might be 
affected thereby, including your prospective employer.
Remedies
•
Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture 
Notwithstanding any terms of this Award Agreement to the contrary, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to recover 
from you up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross 
number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed (including shares withheld for tax purposes) under this 
award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
•
Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:
◦
you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational 
harm to the Firm or its business activities, or
◦
this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were 
responsible for the inaccuracy, or
◦
this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
◦
you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise, or assess, in a timely manner and as 
reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business 
activities, or
◦
your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “Definitions” below) or, in the case 
of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been 
terminated for Cause. 
•
Recovery
You may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable 
vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as follows:
•
Payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the three-year period prior to a notice-
of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦
you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your 
employment, or
◦
you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”, or
•
In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one-year period prior 
to notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of 
the detrimental and risk-related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other 
Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.  
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring 
payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  
Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to 
provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  
For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection 
shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be 
under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.
For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  
However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to 
shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to 
pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made 
(whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund 
or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in 
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery 
under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” and “EMEA Malus and Clawback 
Policy - Identified Staff”.
•
Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations” herein 
will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a 
matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation 
of any of the provisions set forth in “Your Obligations”; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in 
addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.
Administrative Provisions
Withholding Taxes: As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each 
distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any 
other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent 
authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a 
number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by 
law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and 
shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated 
with the award and/or vested shares directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off: Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting 
date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including 
Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from 
any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account 
agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or 
unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any 
obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent.  
Binding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger 
or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or 
continued employment.  Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason 
at any time.  This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm 
to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining 
severance.
Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of 
shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these 
terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
Interpretation/Administration:  The Committee or its nominee has sole and complete authority to interpret and 
administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this 
Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-
employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; 
and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the 
Committee and their respective nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By 
way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective nominees shall be 
entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any 
time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under 
this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its nominee considers advisable 
to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and 
accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described 
above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code 
if it is applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human 
Resources of JPMorgan Chase.
Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any 
court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., 
as to length of service, time, geographical area, or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary 
to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.
Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the 
purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on 
your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for 
compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your 
personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any 
time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you 
terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled.
Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, 
without regard to conflicts of law principles. 
Choice of Forum: By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise 
subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly 
in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the event such a dispute is not subject to 
arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You 
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute 
and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims: By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection 
with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or 
arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a 
representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or 
joint action.
Litigation: By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the 
Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or 
any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its 
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not 
entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the 
event of such a suit by the Firm.

Connected Persons must never trade or engage in any transaction in Firm Securities 
while in possession of Firm MNPI.  In addition, neither JPMC nor any Firm subsidiary 
may trade in Firm Securities when in possession of Firm MNPI, consistent with 
applicable law.  When JPMC possesses or may be deemed to possess Firm MNPI, it 
will generally observe a “blackout period” during which it will not trade in Firm 
Securities. However, the Firm may repurchase its common stock under a 10b5-1 Plan 
during the blackout period preceding each quarterly earnings announcement.
4. Prohibition on Unauthorized Disclosure
Firm Personnel and their Connected Persons must not impermissibly provide Firm 
MNPI to any person who may trade on the basis of that information (i.e., “tipping”).  In 
addition, Firm MNPI must not be shared with any person unless the disclosure 
complies with the Firm’s policies concerning the safeguarding of confidential 
information, including the Code of Conduct. 
5. Policies Applicable to Window List Personnel
5.1
Window List Personnel
Firm Personnel who have or may have access to Firm MNPI are designated as 
Window List Personnel.  Firm Personnel are notified via email when they 
become Window List Personnel.
Window List Personnel and their Connected Persons are prohibited from 
trading in Firm Securities during any Closed Window Period.  During any Open 
Window Period, Window List Personnel and their Connected Persons are 
permitted to trade in Firm Securities after obtaining preapproval from the 
Compliance Department. Any such approval is valid for the length indicated 
on the approval notification which is generally the end of the next business 
day, unless otherwise stipulated.  An Open Window Period may be closed or 
suspended at any time if circumstances require such action with respect to 
some or all persons designated as Window List Personnel. If preapproval for a 
transaction is requested during a Closed Window Period, the Window List 
Person making the request will receive a denial notification from Compliance 
and will not be authorized to execute the trade. In extremely rare 
circumstances, an exception may be granted in consultation with the Window 
List Person’s manager, Compliance and Legal.  
Non-Window List Personnel are not subject to the preapproval requirements 
described in this Section 5.1 and in Section 6.2 or the minimum holding period 
requirements described in Section 7.3, but regional or line of business-
specific restrictions may apply. 
For additional requirements for Corporate Officers and Directors, see Section 
6.
5.2
Window Covered Transactions
Window List Personnel and their Connected Persons may only engage in the 
following types of transactions in Firm Securities, subject to compliance with 
preapproval requirements and the requirement that the transaction be 
conducted during an Open Window Period:
• Direct purchases, sales and gifts of JPMC common stock or other Firm 
Securities, including self-directed sales to meet a margin call;
• Liquidating holdings of Firm Securities under the ESPP or the Firm’s 
deferred compensation plan;
• Placing, cancelling or amending limit orders (i.e., an order to buy or sell a 
stock at a specific price or better) with respect to Firm Securities;
• Entering into, amending or terminating 10b5-1 Plans with respect to Firm 
Securities; and 
• Use of previously-owned JPMC shares or share withholding for option 
exercises, unless as part of a 10b5-1 Plan entered into during an Open 
Window Period.
Additional restrictions apply to JPMC Employee Stock Options and JPMC 
Stock Appreciation Rights.
The following transactions are not considered to be restricted transactions for 
Window List Personnel and their Connected Persons and are not required to 
be preapproved:
• Dividend reinvestments and automatic purchases of JPMC common 
stock in accordance with previously made employee benefit elections 
(e.g., the ESPP) entered into (or amended) and preapproved during an 
Open Window Period; 
• Transactions under a 10b5-1 Plan entered into (or amended) and 
preapproved during an Open Window Period; and
• Limit orders and derivatives that are executed during a Closed Window 
Period that were placed during an Open Window Period.
6. Policies Applicable to Corporate Officers and Directors
6.1
Transactions that are Required to be Pursuant to a 10b5-1 Plan
When a Corporate Officer  or Director wishes to engage in an open market 
sale of Firm Securities, the transaction must be made pursuant to a 10b5-1 
Plan.  
When a Corporate Officer  or Director wishes to (i) exercise and hold a SAR or 
option, (ii) make a charitable gift of Firm Securities, (iii) create a GRAT relating 
to Firm Securities or (iv) transfer Firm Securities to or from a GRAT or another 
trust, the transaction requires pre-approval under this Policy but is not 
required to be pursuant to a 10b5-1 Plan.
A Corporate Officer  or Director may enter into a 10b5-1 Plan subject to 
compliance with the Firm’s other share retention policies.  To enter into a 
10b5-1 Plan, a Corporate Officer or Director must comply with the preapproval 
requirements described in Section 6.2 of this Policy.
All 10b5-1 Plans must comply with all of the requirements set forth in Rule 
10b5-1(c) and may be entered into, amended or terminated only during an 
Open Window Period. 
6.2
Pre-approval for Firm Securities Transactions and Entry into 10b5-1 Plans
During an Open Window Period, Corporate Officers  and Directors are 
permitted to trade in Firm Securities after obtaining the preapprovals 
described below.  
• Corporate Officers and Directors must receive preapproval from the CEO 
and the GC for any transactions in Firm Securities that require 
preapproval under Section 5 and for entry into, amendment of or 
termination of a 10b5-1 Plan under Section 6.1. 
• In the case of transactions or 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the GC, 
preapproval is required from the CEO, 
• in the case of transactions or 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the Firmwide 
Controller, approval is required from the GC and the CFO, and 
• in the case of transactions or 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the CEO, 
approval is required from the GC. 
The preapprovals described above for Corporate Officers are submitted to 
the Compliance Department for its preapproval, which is valid for the length 
indicated on the approval notification which is generally the end of the next 
business day, unless otherwise stipulated.   
7. Other Prohibitions
Other restrictions that are applicable to transactions in Firm Securities are described 
below.
7.1
Prohibited Trading Activity
Trading with respect to Firm Securities is prohibited for Window List 
Personnel and all other Firm Personnel who are subject to personal account 
dealing restrictions under Firm policies in the following: 
• Forwards and futures (all asset classes) 
• Swaps (all asset classes) 
• Uncovered option strategies except Long-Term Equity Anticipation 
Securities (LEAPS) 
• Short sales
Except as set forth in Section 7.2, direct hedging strategies (e.g., covered 
calls) with respect to Firm Securities are permitted but must be proportionate 
to the risk (i.e., fully covered with underlying shares).   
All Employees are prohibited from hedging or pledging unvested shares of 
JPMC common stock received as compensation.
7.2
Anti-Hedging/Anti-Pledging
Shares of JPMC common stock owned outright or through deferred 
compensation by a member of the JPMC Operating Committee or Director 
may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged as collateral, nor 
may the economic risk of such shares be hedged. 
7.3
Minimum Holding Period
Window List Personnel and their Connected Persons are required to hold Firm 
Securities for a minimum holding period (specific to each region and/or line of 
business) prior to transacting in those Firm Securities. 
Vested shares of JPMC common stock or shares of JPMC common stock 
received in connection with purchases under the ESPP are deemed to have 
satisfied the minimum holding period requirement.
8. Post-termination Transactions
If a Firm Person is aware of Firm MNPI when their employment, directorship or other 
service relationship with the Firm terminates, that Firm Person and their Connected 
Persons may not trade in Firm Securities or disclose any Firm Material Nonpublic 
Information until such information has become public or is no longer material.
9. Personal Responsibility for Compliance with this Policy and Potential Disciplinary 
Action
This Policy is designed to reduce the risk of violations of the insider trading 
provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, but compliance with this Policy is not an 
assurance that an insider trading violation will not be found to have occurred.  The 
ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and avoiding improper trading 
rests exclusively with Firm Personnel and their Connected Persons.  Any action on 
the part of Firm Personnel and their Connected Persons pursuant to this Policy (or 
otherwise) does not insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities 
laws and this Policy does not constitute legal advice in any way.  The existence of a 
personal financial emergency does not excuse anyone subject to this Policy from 
compliance with this Policy and the laws prohibiting insider trading.
In addition to potential criminal and civil liability, failure to comply with the 
requirements of this Policy may result in the receipt of Policy reminders or violations 
which may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment 
(subject to local laws and regulations).  The Firm also reserves the right to instruct an 
individual to cancel any trade at his or her expense.
For further information or questions regarding this Policy, Firm Personnel may reach 
out to the Compliance Department or Office of the Secretary.  Firm Personnel should 
also refer to the Code of Conduct and other related Firm policies.

Exhibit 97
Policy for the Recovery of Erroneously 
Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation
Effective Date: October 2, 2023
1.
Summary or Rationale
In accordance with the applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) Listed 
Company Manual, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 
(“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10D-1 thereunder (“Rule 10D-1”), JPMorganChase (the “Firm”) has 
adopted this policy (this “Policy”) to provide for the recovery of Erroneously Awarded 
Incentive-Based Compensation from Executive Officers in the event of a Restatement. All 
capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in 
Section 5, below.
2. Scope

•
All
2.1.  Included in Scope 
This Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person:
•
after beginning service as an Executive Officer,
•
who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that 
Incentive-Based Compensation,
•
while the Firm has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, and
•
during the Recovery Period.  
Notwithstanding the look-back requirement, the Firm is only required to apply this Policy to 
Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after October 2, 2023. This Policy will 
continue to apply after an employee has terminated.
For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation shall be deemed “received” in 
the Firm’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the 
Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the 
Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.
3. Changes from Previous Version
This is the first version of this Policy.
4. Policy Statement
The Firm shall recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based 
Compensation in the event that the Firm is required to prepare a Restatement.
For clarity, the Firm’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based 
Compensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or when a Restatement is filed. 
The Firm shall recover Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in compliance 
with this Policy except to the extent provided under Section 4.1.2 below.
4.1
Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation
4.1.1
In the event of a Restatement, the Firm will reasonably promptly recover the 
Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation received in accordance 
with the NYSE rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:
•
For purposes of determining the relevant Recovery Period, the date that the Firm 
is required to prepare the Restatement (“Restatement Date”) is the earlier to 
occur of:
◦
the date the Board of Directors of the Firm (the “Board”), a committee of 
the Board, or the officer or officers of the Firm authorized to take such 
action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should 
have concluded, that the Firm is required to prepare a Restatement, or
◦
the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the 
Firm to prepare a Restatement.  
•
The Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board (the 
“Committee”) composed of independent directors responsible for executive 
compensation, or in the absence of such committee, a majority of the 
independent directors serving on the Board, shall determine the Erroneously 
Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation received by each Executive Officer 
during the relevant Recovery Period. 
•
The amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery under this 
Policy is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the 
amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been 
received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed 
without regard to any taxes paid (the “Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based 
Compensation”). 
•
For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Firm’s stock 
price or total shareholder return, where the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-
Based Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from 
the information in the applicable Restatement:
◦
The amount to be recovered shall be based on a reasonable estimate of 
the effect of the Restatement on the Firm’s stock price or total 
shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was 
received; and
◦
The Firm shall maintain documentation of the determination of such 
reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the NYSE.
•
The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of 
recovering Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation based on the 
particular facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set 
forth in 4.1.2 below, in no event may the Firm settle for an amount that is less than 
the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to 
recovery under this Policy.
•
To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Firm for any 
Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation received under any 
duplicative recovery obligations established by the Firm or applicable law, it shall 
be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the Erroneously 
Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this 
Policy.
1.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Firm shall not be required to 
take the actions contemplated by Section 4.1.1 above if it is determined by the 
Committee that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following 
conditions are met:
•
The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would 
exceed the amount to be recovered. Before making this determination, the Firm 
shall make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-
Based Compensation, document such attempt(s) and provide such 
documentation to the NYSE;
•
Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to 
November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be 
impracticable to recover any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based 
Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Firm shall obtain an 
opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would 
result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion shall be provided to the NYSE; 
or 
•
Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under 
which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Firm, to fail to meet the 
requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.
4.2
Disclosure Requirements
The Firm shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy and recoveries under this Policy 
in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Federal securities laws, including the 
disclosure required by the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings.
4.3
Prohibition of Indemnification
Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification arrangement or insurance policy with any 
individual covered by this Policy, the Firm shall not indemnify any Executive Officer or former 
Executive Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, 
including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance obtained by any such 
covered individual to fund amounts recoverable under this Policy.
4.4
 Administration; Amendment; Termination
All determinations under this Policy shall be made by the Committee, including 
determinations regarding how any recovery under this Policy is effected.  Any 
determinations of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive and need not be 
uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy.
The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time and may terminate this Policy at 
any time, in its discretion.
4.5
 Other Recovery Rights
Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies 
or rights of recovery that may be available to the Firm under applicable law, regulation or 
rule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Firm or any provision in any employment 
agreement, equity award agreement, compensation plan, or any other agreement or 
arrangement.
5. Defined Terms 
Executive Officer An Executive Officer is the Firm’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer 
(or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Firm in charge of a 
principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other 
officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-
making functions for the Firm. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making 
functions that are not significant. Identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy will 
include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to 17 CFR 229.401(b).
Financial Reporting 
Measure
Any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in 
preparing the Firm’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from 
such measure. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures. A 
Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Firm’s financial statements or 
included in a filing with the SEC.
Incentive-Based 
Compensation
Any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a 
Financial Reporting Measure.
Recovery Period With respect to any accounting restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately 
preceding the Restatement Date, and if the Firm changes its fiscal year, any transition period of less 
than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.
Restatement An accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Firm with any financial 
reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to 
correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued 
financial statements (a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the 
error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” 
restatement).
